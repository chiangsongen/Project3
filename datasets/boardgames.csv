Playing board games has been great for getting away from the computer games, while still being challenging and social. It's been great to see everyone excited to play games when going to meetups, and meeting new friends along the way!

A few games that are not included in the pictures are **Jaipur, Hive Pocket, Love Letter, &amp; Friday**.

***How long have you been in the hobby?***

I went to a meetup because I was bored a year ago in June, and played Sagrada, Scythe, and Carcassonne. It was great! Met some great people, and from a few other meetups I now have a core group of about 5 people that get together often, as well as a weekly group at work.

***What would you change about your collection if you could?***

I am happy with where my collection stands, as I have a game that satisfies most of the different mechanics that I look for in a game. If I had to change something, however, I'd probably get rid of Puerto Rico. The newer games with the nice components seem to be the ones I'm drawn to.

***Favorite Games***

Currently my top three games in my collection are:

**Scythe**: This game is my collection prize. I have all the expansions, upgraded tokens and coins, promo cards, and both Broken Token organizers in the Legendary box. I also recently got the modular board. After my play-through of this game today, I have logged my 84 time playing Scythe!

**7-Wonders Duel**: My favorite game to play as 2 players in my collection. Love the drafting from the pyramid, as well as the multiple win conditions that can sneak up on you.

**Blood Rage**: Not using a conflict type of gamer, but this area-control game with the drafting is so satisfying. All of my games have been close, and multiple strategies have won games, so it's very open each time we play.

***Shame List***

I'm happy to say that I have played everything in the collection at least 4 times (expect Puerto Rico (2 times))!

***Next games to add to the collection***

There isn't really anything on my radar at the moment; I'm looking forward to just playing what I have more. However, if anyone thinks a game would be a great add to my collection, I'd love to hear recommendations!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collection: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/sY4ciax""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/sY4ciax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

[Current Collection](https://imgur.com/a/60E9QPT)

&amp;#x200B;

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?**

&amp;#x200B;

Some background:

My wife and I received Catan and Carcasonne some years ago as gifts after playing them elsewhere but we never cracked them open at the time.  About 3 years ago my interest in collecting comic books led us to go into a comic/game store while on vacation where we first discovered how many designer games there are, as this particular shop had them wall to wall / ceiling to floor.  We were overwhelmed by the selection which was  obvious to another customer in the store who asked if we played games and we told them this would be our first purchase of a designer game.  She recommended as the must buy first purchase Dominion (1st ed.) which we took her up on.  That game went on a shelf when we got back from vacation and sat there for a year or so.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year or so later we finally decided to crack it open since it was quite expensive, unwrapped all the cards, my wife started reading the manual and gave up shortly after.  We put all cards back and the game went back on the shelf.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to summer 2018, we had been playing mainstream games while waiting for dinner to cook etc.  Things like Mille Bornes, Rack-O, Rummikkub.  That got us talking about the Dominion game we shelved a year earlier and we decided to give it another go. This time we stuck with it and we instantly fell in love with it.

&amp;#x200B;

From there on out we started visiting BGG and getting a feel for the kind of games we wanted to try. One of the benefits of getting into this hobby late was that a lot of collectors were getting rid of older games (new to us) to make room for new ones. That allowed to take advantage of some really great bulk deals to kick start our collection.

&amp;#x200B;

**What would you change about your collection if you could?**

&amp;#x200B;

One regret is giving up on Dominion so easily years ago as we missed out on several years of enjoying that game and many others.  Part and parcel with that is the fact we narrowing missed acquiring 7th Continent via Kickstarter on a short re-release as that happened around the same time we let ourselves be intimidated by the Dominion rule book.  Now that we're much more comfortable with terminology and play styles we know it's a game we would love, but also very close to the top of our wish list.

&amp;#x200B;

As far regretful purchases in our collection, my wife and I have so far have put in a lot of research, testing at game cafes, videos, etc prior to purchasing almost all of our games.  We've been very fortunate that almost of our collection gets played every 6 months.  With exception of  Shadowrun Crossfire where we discovered the particular engine used was not to our liking and can create wide swings of difficulty which is frustrating.

&amp;#x200B;

**About our collection**

&amp;#x200B;

We started building our collection under the premise that we needed to balance our purchases with lighter games when we have our game night with my 70 year old parents every weekend and heavier games when it's just my wife &amp; I playing.  You will see this reflected in the pictures.  This year however we have been exposing my parents to heavier games and now the delineation when purchasing games isn't really needed.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents have successfully learned and played Pandemic, Stone Age, Citadels and Clank will be most likely next weekend.  This breakthrough has lowered the restrictions on how my wife &amp; I buy things as we initially wanted to expose my parents to lighter designers games but now we feel they're capable of playing anything we would enjoy as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Majority of our games are acquired via classifieds, with gifts and new buys being the minority.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Favorites**

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Sentinels of the Multiverse, Thunderstone Advance, Covert, Great Western Trail, Decrypto

Me: Roll Player, Dominion, Sentinels of the Multivese, Imperial Settlers, Great Western Trail, 7 Wonders Duel

&amp;#x200B;

**Newest Games**

&amp;#x200B;

\- Clank

\- Azul

\- Sagrada

\- Kingsforge

\- Architects of the West Kingdom

&amp;#x200B;

**Prized Possessions**

&amp;#x200B;

Our Sentinels of the Multiverse big box with the drawers and room for all the expansions.  One of our first bulk purchases when we got into this included Sentinels of the Multiverse deluxe with over 50% of the expansion content, environments, etc in the box.  We fell in love with the game and picked up some of the missing content and bought the big box to hold it all.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife owns a woodworking shop and I aided in the construction of a custom dice tray and card holders which always get attention.

&amp;#x200B;

**Have / Haven't played**

&amp;#x200B;

We make a concerted effort to rotate the games we play as much as we can so everything is played in our collection to some degree.  We do get in grooves where we fall in love with a game again that hadn't been played much and go on a binge with it.  That being said there are a few games that don't see too much action

&amp;#x200B;

\- Shadowrun Crossfire: for reason listed above

\- Kingdom Builder: I like it, wife hates it.  Have only played 2 player.  Thinking of trying with the parents to see if it's better @ 4

\- Power Grid: Didn't mind it but theme didn't really do anything for us, no expansions.  Also only played with 2 player

\- Ascension Darkness Unleashed: First Ascension game we got, but then we picked up Immortal Heroes which we prefer over it.

\- Marvel Dice Masters X-Men vs Avengers: Found the rules confusing and we're not fans of direct conflict games.

&amp;#x200B;

**Potentially leaving collection**

&amp;#x200B;

\- Shadowrun Crossfire

\- Kingdom Builder

\- Ascension Darkness Unleashed

\- Marvel Dice Masters X-Men vs Avengers

\- Munchkin: Not fun with 2 players, we did finally play it with 3 but it didn't get better for us.  It was an early somewhat un-research purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gaming Habits**

&amp;#x200B;

My wife &amp; I play at least a few games during the week, followed by a 'game night' with my parents every weekend which usually consists of a 5 hour session of 2 heavy hitter games and 2 fillers.  This replaced a previous weekend 'movie night' and we're finding this a lot more entertaining.

&amp;#x200B;

**Misc**

&amp;#x200B;

\- My wife &amp; I have near 500 logged plays each and the parents have just passed 150 plays each.

\- I log every possible detail to BGG (I'm a software engineer) and like to have as much data as possible.

\- Our current gaming table is our 3 x 7' farmhouse dining table which we just purchased a 'Big Viking Game Mats' mat for.

\- We have kickstarted 4 or 5 games now and enjoy helping getting these cool game designs published where they might not otherwise come into existence.

\- Shelving unit is currently an Ikea Kallax at max capacity.  Looking to add an 8 cubby unit soon.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Have been enjoying exploring everyone's collections and reading about their designer hobby experiences.  Looking forward to answering any questions you might have for us about our developing collection.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have / Haven&amp;#39;t played&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We make a concerted effort to rotate the games we play as much as we can so everything is played in our collection to some degree.  We do get in grooves where we fall in love with a game again that hadn&amp;#39;t been played much and go on a binge with it.  That being said there are a few games that don&amp;#39;t see too much action&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Shadowrun Crossfire: for reason listed above&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Kingdom Builder: I like it, wife hates it.  Have only played 2 player.  Thinking of trying with the parents to see if it&amp;#39;s better @ 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Power Grid: Didn&amp;#39;t mind it but theme didn&amp;#39;t really do anything for us, no expansions.  Also only played with 2 player&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Ascension Darkness Unleashed: First Ascension game we got, but then we picked up Immortal Heroes which we prefer over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Marvel Dice Masters X-Men vs Avengers: Found the rules confusing and we&amp;#39;re not fans of direct conflict games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potentially leaving collection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Shadowrun Crossfire&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Kingdom Builder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Ascension Darkness Unleashed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Marvel Dice Masters X-Men vs Avengers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Munchkin: Not fun with 2 players, we did finally play it with 3 but it didn&amp;#39;t get better for us.  It was an early somewhat un-research purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming Habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife &amp;amp; I play at least a few games during the week, followed by a &amp;#39;game night&amp;#39; with my parents every weekend which usually consists of a 5 hour session of 2 heavy hitter games and 2 fillers.  This replaced a previous weekend &amp;#39;movie night&amp;#39; and we&amp;#39;re finding this a lot more entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- My wife &amp;amp; I have near 500 logged plays each and the parents have just passed 150 plays each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I log every possible detail to BGG (I&amp;#39;m a software engineer) and like to have as much data as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Our current gaming table is our 3 x 7&amp;#39; farmhouse dining table which we just purchased a &amp;#39;Big Viking Game Mats&amp;#39; mat for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- We have kickstarted 4 or 5 games now and enjoy helping getting these cool game designs published where they might not otherwise come into existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Shelving unit is currently an Ikea Kallax at max capacity.  Looking to add an 8 cubby unit soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have been enjoying exploring everyone&amp;#39;s collections and reading about their designer hobby experiences.  Looking forward to answering any questions you might have for us about our developing collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

NFP includes 16  Airplane Figures, 3 Airplane Stands, 30 Air Combat Cards, 8 Summary  Cards, 15 Nation Markers, 18 Machine Gun and 12 Bomb Markers, 1 Rules  booklet and 1 Scenario booklet with 21 new Scenarios.

What's important to notice here is that while the box includes an awesome amount of historical aircraft, ***it only includes*** ***3 airplane stands.*** Looking forward to epic air battles? Well, not with three stands. Memoir '44 is a ground warfare game, but this expansion is dedicated to air combat and includes at least three planes for every Memoir '44 faction. With so many planes in the box but not enough stands for even two factions to have all their planes in the air seems like a blatant attempt to force dedicated players to purchase two copies of the expansion. This is something avid Memoir '44 players do compulsively but it's a bit sad to see the expansion so hamstrung out of the gate.

Despite being scarce, the stands are well designed with a slot on them to place a visual marker to indicate what aircraft you have in play, which is really useful because ***all of the planes are the same color plastic***. Players not wanting to check a token to figure out what faction's plane is in the air will have to paint their models. I speed painted my planes to somewhat match the faction plastic for my ground forces, plus I color coded my planes' wingtips to match the Summary Cards to indicate if an aircraft is a fighter, a fighter-bomber, or a bomber. This might seem redundant, but there are several models that are somewhat in-between size wise which could make it difficult at first glance to figure out whether your armor units are at risk from an aircraft or not. This bit of reference paint solves a gameplay problem, but it does remove some of the realism from the painted aircraft.

The models themselves are satisfactory and on par with the rest of Memoir '44. The heavy bombers look great and were really fun to paint. The smaller fighters, on the other hand, lack detail and don't hold their shape well - several of the small fighters had bent tail ends. This was pretty mild, but noticeable. If you're a perfectionist you might want to use some hot water to try to set the models straight because I imagine most of the kits will have this problem. The small fighter models are also so tiny that I really worry about losing them.

The cards and markers are standard Memoir '44, with the Air Combat cards being treated as all other Combat Cards introduced in Winter Wars, Sword of Stalingrad, and Through Jungle and Desert. If you haven't played with Combat Cards before, then this will be new to you. What's cool is if you have these other expansions, you can mix and match Air Combat in with these other collections, making for some really interesting scenarios.

If you're a Memoir '44 fan and considering buying this set I would say you should ***maybe*** buy it. Do you own most of the other Combat cards? Then definitely buy it; the potential for fun and interesting Combat Card synergies is too good to pass up. Do you mostly play two players? Buy it if you're interested in seeing what a few planes can do to the battlefield but don't expect epic air duels due to a lack of stands. Do you mostly play Overlord? It seems like you need two copies to make the expansion Overlord-ready, but that is the case with most Memoir '44 expansions.

If you have any more questions about the components or other features of the expansion let me know. I can also provide some tips on how to paint your set in a few hours assuming you aren't picky about historical accuracy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awww, what&amp;#39;s in the box?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While I feel that I buy a lot of games, in the grand scheme of things it's not that bad. Lots of my smaller games and stuff on the bottom shelf was found in thrift shops (besieged for 10 bux, still my best find to date).

In the next few months I'm going to cull about a quarter of this to bankroll new stuff and make space for upcoming kickstarter projects. Probably get rid of Nerath, Axis and allies, Rick and morty, broom service, and munchkin.

It comes with 90 over-sized cards with attractive an graphic design and artwork. With each game playable in less than 15 minutes, you can expect to get in at least a dozen plays before you've discovered the entire system. The basic concept is fairly straight forward: cards have numbers, and you're using sets of cards to capture ""Fortresses"". To capture a fortress from another player, you must play a set of cards worth more than theirs. But you don't know the exact strength of their defenders, so there's considerable bluffing involved, and numerous twists will be introduced that affect how the value of your cards are calculated, and other elements get added to the gameplay as the rules change. Can you win the game by being the player with the largest number of fortresses?

**GAME-PLAY**

The main aim of Fast Forward FORTRESS is to play cards to capture fortresses, by playing a set of cards of the highest value. Because you don't know the value of the cards currently beneath the fortress, there's considerable scope for bluffing. The game also employs Friedeman Friese's fable concept, in that you learn the rules as you play, and cards with new rules and mechanics emerge as the game progresses. Occasionally the rules may create some ambiguities, although fortunately anything that isn't clear won't usually be game-breaking. A big reason that accounts for why Fortress is so entertaining is to play the fun of discovering these new rules, cards, and mechanics. Some people even find that the fable concept works better than the concept of legacy games. The game does start fairly slowly, but over time becomes more and more interesting. Most individual games only take around ten minutes, while playing through the entire system will take about 90 minutes. There is an addictive quality that will keep you playing games one after another, but there is replayability even once you have gone through the entire system. Even those uninterested in playing the entire system more than once, found that Fortress was worth playing through even just once, given how much fun it was.

**IMPRESSIONS**

Friedemann Friese continues to impress with his creative approach to game design, and Fast Forward: FORTRESS is another fine entry in the excellent Fast Forward series. Admittedly, serious gamers who can't stand light and tactical games might find this an exercise in frustration. Or they may find it more interesting as a theoretical concept in game development than as a gaming experience that they want to be part of, due to the fact that it is a relatively small and light game. But even many of them won't be able to help themselves admiring the clever game system, and may even find that the process of discovering the rules and cards is far more fun than they ever expected.

The game-play is not at all difficult to learn, and you will have to change your approach as new cards and new rules get added to the game. With virtually all of the Fast Forward games, this one included, there have been reports of issues with the clarity of the rules in certain situations. That is almost inevitable with a game of this type, but fortunately most questions can be easily answered by consulting BoardGameGeek forums.

Certainly a lot of the fun of this game can be attributed to the joy of discovery. But fortunately that's not the only thing that Fortress offers. The game really encourages bluffing, and this is a mechanic that I personally enjoy a great deal. It plays very quickly, making it ideal for a filler, but the changing rules, cards, and gameplay means it offers something unique that you won't find in your average filler. This gives it a very addictive quality, and even though most games are finished in under 10 minutes, you'll often find players wanting to play over and again. Even if you decide to shelve the game after playing through the system once, you'll usually be more than satisfied that you've had your money's worth. But I believe that Fast Forward: FORTRESS does hold enough interest for return visits beyond this, especially with different players or player counts, and due to the fact that it is a light gaming experience that commends itself as a filler.

**RECOMMENDATION**

Fast Forward: FORTRESS may have a small box, but inside there is a unique Friedemann Friese game experience that provides an enormous amount of fun. You'll enjoy exploring the different twists and turns as you learn the game, especially the first time through. I recommend the entire Fast Forward series, and this is no exception!

***Where to get it?*** *Fast Forward: FORTRESS is available from the publisher Stronghold Games (*[*here*](https://strongholdgames.com/store/board-games/fast-forward-fortress/)*)*.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedemann Friese&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/231665/fast-forward-fortress""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast Forward: FORTRESS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; handles 2-4 players, and is one of the finest entries in his &amp;quot;Fast Forward&amp;quot; series of light, fast, and fun family fillers. It comes with 90 over-sized cards with attractive an graphic design and artwork. With each game playable in less than 15 minutes, you can expect to get in at least a dozen plays before you&amp;#39;ve discovered the entire system. The basic concept is fairly straight forward: cards have numbers, and you&amp;#39;re using sets of cards to capture &amp;quot;Fortresses&amp;quot;. To capture a fortress from another player, you must play a set of cards worth more than theirs. But you don&amp;#39;t know the exact strength of their defenders, so there&amp;#39;s considerable bluffing involved, and numerous twists will be introduced that affect how the value of your cards are calculated, and other elements get added to the gameplay as the rules change. Can you win the game by being the player with the largest number of fortresses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GAME-PLAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main aim of Fast Forward FORTRESS is to play cards to capture fortresses, by playing a set of cards of the highest value. Because you don&amp;#39;t know the value of the cards currently beneath the fortress, there&amp;#39;s considerable scope for bluffing. The game also employs Friedeman Friese&amp;#39;s fable concept, in that you learn the rules as you play, and cards with new rules and mechanics emerge as the game progresses. Occasionally the rules may create some ambiguities, although fortunately anything that isn&amp;#39;t clear won&amp;#39;t usually be game-breaking. A big reason that accounts for why Fortress is so entertaining is to play the fun of discovering these new rules, cards, and mechanics. Some people even find that the fable concept works better than the concept of legacy games. The game does start fairly slowly, but over time becomes more and more interesting. Most individual games only take around ten minutes, while playing through the entire system will take about 90 minutes. There is an addictive quality that will keep you playing games one after another, but there is replayability even once you have gone through the entire system. Even those uninterested in playing the entire system more than once, found that Fortress was worth playing through even just once, given how much fun it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPRESSIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friedemann Friese continues to impress with his creative approach to game design, and Fast Forward: FORTRESS is another fine entry in the excellent Fast Forward series. Admittedly, serious gamers who can&amp;#39;t stand light and tactical games might find this an exercise in frustration. Or they may find it more interesting as a theoretical concept in game development than as a gaming experience that they want to be part of, due to the fact that it is a relatively small and light game. But even many of them won&amp;#39;t be able to help themselves admiring the clever game system, and may even find that the process of discovering the rules and cards is far more fun than they ever expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game-play is not at all difficult to learn, and you will have to change your approach as new cards and new rules get added to the game. With virtually all of the Fast Forward games, this one included, there have been reports of issues with the clarity of the rules in certain situations. That is almost inevitable with a game of this type, but fortunately most questions can be easily answered by consulting BoardGameGeek forums.&lt;/p&gt;

(The teal-ish box on the bottom shelf contains my miniature painting supplies; I've painted a few Imperial Assault figures and they turned out okay, but I don't continue because I'm scared I'll do something wrong and ruin a mini. The Dominion box on the top shelf isn't actually Dominion, it's scenario cards for Lord of the Rings LCG. The Dominion box on the second shelf, on the other hand, is indeed Dominion.)

I try not to hold on to games I don't enjoy that much, or games that just don't get played - according to BGG I've removed 90+ games from my collection over the years, and there are some I'm trying to get rid of even now, but I don't seem to have local buyers (or maybe I'm just asking for too much) and I don't really want to deal with shipping them.

**Favorites**

* Star Wars LCG, by far the best dueling card game I've ever played. It had a unique twist on deck construction - instead of building your deck one card at a time, you get sets of 6 cards and you take all six or none - that made the game simultaneously easy to get into (okay, not really, the rules are pretty hard, but at least putting together a functional deck is easy) and yet super deep. I'm still bummed about how FFG constantly mistreated their own game and it had to die.

* Terraforming Mars, a ton of engine building fun. I love seeing my tableau and resource production grow over time, and there's a ton of variety from game to game because of that huge stack of cards (which is becoming a pain to shuffle)

* Concordia, one of the most elegant rulesets ever for a game above gateway. And I really like the way the cards determine what actions you can take and also how you score, but the two don't really align (like the prefect cards - they let you get resources for each of your trading posts in one province, so you'd like to build a lot in that province, but they score for different provinces that have you trading posts, so you also want to spread out).

**Shelf of shame** *in alphabetical order*

* Gentes

* Greenland (I've never played a Phil Eklund game yet, and the rules are scary)

* Neanderthal (same as Greenland)

* Pathfinder ACG

* Privateer (not really interested in playing it either, it just looks super dull)

* Rise to Power (same as Privateer)

* Russian Railroads (have played, just not my copy)

* Watson and Holmes

**Things I'm trying to get rid of**

* 20th Century - keeps getting overlooked and doesn't hit the table

* Alchemists - same, because in the groups I play with there's always someone who doesn't like it

* Brew Crafters - I probably own too many worker placement games

* Compounded - there's nothing exciting in this game for me

* Conan - it takes up entirely too much shelf space to be just sitting there, and the one time I tried it we spent like 5 hours on one scenario

* Founders of Gloomhaven - slightly more convoluted than it needed to be

* Legacy: Gears of Time - the theme is cool, but gameplay is kind of meh

* One Night Ultimate Werewolf - I've had fun with it, but decided I prefer Avalon or Spyfall when I want quick social deduction; ONUW is just a bit too chaotic

* Privateer - got it from KS after insane delays, but now that it's here it just looks boring, so I haven't even tried it

* Templar Intrigue - not my thing

* This War of Mine - I actually don't mind having it and wouldn't mind playing a second time, but I feel like I should be able to sell this for a pretty penny, and that's better than a game that isn't getting played

**Incoming kickstarters**

* 7th Continent + expansion

* Alhambra designer's edition (I've played basic Alhambra a few times, and it's a neat gateway-ish game)

* Anachrony Infinity box (I've played Anachrony and it's cool, and this box and its contents look super pretty, and 
I'm a sucker for pretty games; also, the modules bring in more ways to screw with time and I wanted to see how those work)

* Awkward Guests

* Blood Rage digital KS extras - I missed the original Blood Rage KS, but I do enjoy the game a lot

* Chocolate Factory

* In the Hall of the Mountain King

* It's a Wonderful World

* Kingdom Rush

* Petrichor + expansion

* Shipwreck Arcana

* Terraforming Mars: Turmoil - I couldn't exactly say no to more TM, at least not when I'm somene who likes to play with all the current expansions

* Tiny Epic Mechs

* Town Builder: Coevorden - honestly I don't remember much about this one; can only hope it's good

* Villagers - should be shipping to me sometime in the near future

**Upcoming purchases** *I like to make few big purchases, and the next one is in three weeks or so, so I'm planning to get a few from this list then*

* Abyss - played once, had a blast

* Concordia Venus - I'm thinking about grabbing the standalone one and selling the old base game just so I don't have to worry about lid lift when I put everything in there

* Downforce, possibly - I've only played once and had fun, but I should probably talk this one over with my girlfriend because I'd be likely to play it with her

* Keyper - played it once two years ago or so, and fell in love

* Orleans - mostly because my girlfriend says I should; a friend has a copy and it'd be enough for me to just play Orleans when he's there, but she wants to play it at other times too

* Palaces of Carrara - I did super badly with picking my scoring times the two times I played, but I'd like to try some more

* Underwater Cities - a lot of card play and engine building here, and I love both of those things","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/MJWWxGi""&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/MJWWxGi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legacy: Gears of Time - the theme is cool, but gameplay is kind of meh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Night Ultimate Werewolf - I&amp;#39;ve had fun with it, but decided I prefer Avalon or Spyfall when I want quick social deduction; ONUW is just a bit too chaotic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privateer - got it from KS after insane delays, but now that it&amp;#39;s here it just looks boring, so I haven&amp;#39;t even tried it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Templar Intrigue - not my thing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This War of Mine - I actually don&amp;#39;t mind having it and wouldn&amp;#39;t mind playing a second time, but I feel like I should be able to sell this for a pretty penny, and that&amp;#39;s better than a game that isn&amp;#39;t getting played&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incoming kickstarters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;7th Continent + expansion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alhambra designer&amp;#39;s edition (I&amp;#39;ve played basic Alhambra a few times, and it&amp;#39;s a neat gateway-ish game)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anachrony Infinity box (I&amp;#39;ve played Anachrony and it&amp;#39;s cool, and this box and its contents look super pretty, and 
I&amp;#39;m a sucker for pretty games; also, the modules bring in more ways to screw with time and I wanted to see how those work)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awkward Guests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood Rage digital KS extras - I missed the original Blood Rage KS, but I do enjoy the game a lot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chocolate Factory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Hall of the Mountain King&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a Wonderful World&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kingdom Rush&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrichor + expansion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shipwreck Arcana&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terraforming Mars: Turmoil - I couldn&amp;#39;t exactly say no to more TM, at least not when I&amp;#39;m somene who likes to play with all the current expansions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny Epic Mechs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Town Builder: Coevorden - honestly I don&amp;#39;t remember much about this one; can only hope it&amp;#39;s good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Villagers - should be shipping to me sometime in the near future&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming purchases&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I like to make few big purchases, and the next one is in three weeks or so, so I&amp;#39;m planning to get a few from this list then&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abyss - played once, had a blast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concordia Venus - I&amp;#39;m thinking about grabbing the standalone one and selling the old base game just so I don&amp;#39;t have to worry about lid lift when I put everything in there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downforce, possibly - I&amp;#39;ve only played once and had fun, but I should probably talk this one over with my girlfriend because I&amp;#39;d be likely to play it with her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keyper - played it once two years ago or so, and fell in love&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orleans - mostly because my girlfriend says I should; a friend has a copy and it&amp;#39;d be enough for me to just play Orleans when he&amp;#39;s there, but she wants to play it at other times too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palaces of Carrara - I did super badly with picking my scoring times the two times I played, but I&amp;#39;d like to try some more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underwater Cities - a lot of card play and engine building here, and I love both of those things&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

[**PV Trailer on Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFoMh1q8Vik)

&amp;#x200B;

[**Page in manga where they start playing Settlers of Catan**](https://imgur.com/dkYrg3X)

&amp;#x200B;

It follows 3 girls at first: the shy girl who is kind of a loner, who then meets the new upbeat transfer student, who then both follow the class president and discover she works at a FLGS.

&amp;#x200B;

The 3 start playing board games together, with the first being Marrakech. (In later chapters they play games like Cockroach Poker, Incan Gold, and eventually Catan)

&amp;#x200B;

The manga has 19 chapters so far, and it's very light on plot, as the game is honestly just a wholesome story about these girls diving into the board gaming hobby.

A little background, we have a fairly small group of 8-9 people who are grad students in the US and play different board games weekly. We mostly play Catan along with some other smaller games like One-night werewolf, codenames, etc.   


We have been playing Concordia for the last few months and till now we have played around 4-5 games, each time with either 3 or 5 players. We are confused about the variation of outcome in the game and whether we are using the correct strategies or not. In all our games, the outcome is only decided by whoever is holding maximum Minerva cards. We end the game with somewhat closer scores, varying by at max 10-15 points.  


We understand the eventual goal here is to maximize cities, provinces covered, resource types generated, colonists and obviously card building. In all our matches, we have played very well balanced because our strategies were mostly defined, generate resource, generate money, build cities or buy cards. All of our games end with most of everyone's cities on board, and the card stack mostly depleted.  


When we count the scores, the only thing that makes the winning player seems to be the Minerva card. Whoever buys the Minerva cards either wins or at least becomes 2nd. This has become so prominent that now when we play, from the very beginning, the first player (if not, the next one) jumps for the Minerva cards at any costs needed. Because, if in the end, everyone covers all resources and has most cities on board, then only the Minerva cards (3X, 5X multipliers) are the only game changer.  

Are we doing something wrong? The game is already getting very monotonous for us because of this lack of randomness. We have tried other strategies (like getting more colonists out along with buying Mars cards) that do not include buying Minerva cards, but it is hard to beat the score multipliers. At least in Catan, the outcome changes because of the dices.

I purchased **DoW:TLN** a few weeks ago. I mostly game solo and occasionally play with my boyfriend. Sadly, all my DoW:TLN games have been solo so far. I find it excessively easy, even when it's on the hardcore side, because there is no betrayer, no secret objectives and no crossroads card. 

I found a DoW solo variant (family first) on bgg and I found it a lot more fun. I think if I ramp up the difficulty on the solo variant, it could be quite a challenge and quite enjoyable.

The 4th edition of High Frontier will be a complete overhaul of the rules, without many changes in the games mechanic or content. It is mostly an effort to make the game as accessible as possible. The ambition is also to open it for enthusiasts from the great community around High Frontier to contribute content to the game. We will continuously look at submitted suggestions for and potentially print and publish such contributions. As such the game will be modular, and some of the earlier expansions will be transformed into modules. We are in the middle of alpha play testing and the lineup of modules may change when all space dust have settled but at this point the initial release will have the following items, along with the names of people involved in the design work for each of them:  

* High Frontier 4 All: Core Game (Basic and Advanced Game) - Dom Rougier + Phil and Jon
* Module 0: Politics (probably incl. in the Core box for KS) - Justin Grey + Phil
* Module I: Commerce: Freighters &amp; GW Thrusters - Jeff Chamberlain + Phil
* Module II: Colonists: Colonization &amp; Bernals - Jeff Chamberlain + Phil
* [MAYBE] Module III: Space Diamonds - Jon + Phil
* [MAYBE] Module IV: - A module by Pawel Garycki + Phi  

Module III and IV may come now or in the next wave of modules. We will probably release modules once a year. Apart from these there are a number of suggested modules in earlier stage of development. Among them one for Combat may be worth mentioning.

My partner and I started by buying **Pandemic** on the advice of our FLGS to kill a snowy evening in 2017 when friends were in town.

From there it snowballed. I purchased **Catan**, remembering it as a super-heavy euro from my youth. Next, **Eldritch Horror**, and the rest is history.

I’d like to find a few more thinky 2-player games, and maybe a grand 4X or even 18XX experience.

I’d happily never touch **Time Stories** or **Mice &amp; Mystics** ever again... in both cases, the gorgeous artwork, and (to me) inspired design just couldn’t save an absolute slog of a game, with underwhelming finishes.

I can’t wait to try **Who Goes There**!

My top few right now are **Lords of Vegas**, **Skull**, **Sushi Go Party**, **Great Western Trail**, and a custom **Bohnanza** I had manufactured for my father-in-law, swapping beans for the Topps baseball cards he collected as a kid.

Not pictured are the usual suspects, Risk, various Monopolies, Twister, Mad Gab etc.

Thanks for looking!

How long have I been into the hobby? I’ve been into tabletop games for almost 30 years. I got hooked with DnD, HeroQuest, Battlemasters, and Risk as a kid. Now that I make good money and my kids are involved, it just gives me a reason to continue on with it.

What would I change about my collection? I really wouldn’t change anything about my physical collection. I AM changing my habits of playing more of what I have instead of buying more of what I might play in the future. Between my various circles of friends, I try to introduce a new game each week. Whether it’s getting inexperienced gamers exposed to something new, getting experienced gamers a new game, or just a reason to open up a sealed game.

I don't even know if this is the right place to share my doubts, since it has a board, but the cards are the main part of the game. In short, for those of you who don't know the game (if you do, skip this paragraph), you have a deck of cards that have really beautiful unique drawings. Each player gets 6 cards. One person at a time will give a theme about one of the cards they have, and all the others chose one of theirs that they think fits the theme. The players then have to guess which cards was given by the person who chose the theme. You are supposed to give a theme so that at least one person votes on the right card, but not everyone.

We have been playing it so often that we are running out of good ideas. I bought an extension to the main deck, and now we play with both at the same time (mixed), which brings new ideas to the table, but also makes it hard to choose good themes, since it's harder to predict which cards the other players have.

And now, my doubts begin:

1- are we supposed to not use both decks at the same time, for the reason that I just mentioned?

2- is it ok to make a theme that you know only one of your friends will get? (like referencing a song only you know, a TV series you know only he has watched) and what about one that every player but one can understand?

3- should we just keep it to more abstract things, like feelings and ideals, or any kind of thing is valid? (implied that this doesn't colide with the previous question)

4- I have been trying to make rounds with specific rules (like ""every theme must be about a person/character"", ""every theme must be the name of one of the present players"", ""every theme must say the exact opposite of what's happening on the card""). I feel like it will create more opportunities to the issues raised in 2 to happen, but it also seems like a good way to keep the game fresh.

You start with 7 towns and put down 4 during setup (thematic board). Only having three towns to add without losing seems nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking that Sharp Fangs would be good for this one because of it&amp;#39;s power right out of the gate. Unfortunately Sharp Fangs loses his bite (sorry) with the level one game effect of adding an additional explorer when exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any tips on this one or a better combo to try? I was hoping that I was reading the loss condition wrong and you started with 7 towns after setup but that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

We set it up a month ago and already have about 100 users.

Discord is a pretty amazing platform where you can chat about your hobby and daily struggles, make friends, play games and many many more. It also serves as a Voip app so you don't need any other software other than Discord to get in touch with your newly made friends or play games together.

&amp;#x200B;

We want Playingoffline to be a place to, discuss board games, comic books, video games, miniatures and share your work, project, get feedback, or even engage in meetups (AZ, US) and conventions, maybe play online too.

We have channels for designers too, so you can showcase your games and maybe reach some potential customer's.

**Original Post**

I've been to my fair share of cons, but last weekend was my first time seeing them from the other side of the bar. I had a blast, met some awesome people and got my ass kicked at Star Realms. It was a truly awesome experience.

However, I was honestly shocked at the way some people spoke to my fellow demonstrators and wanted to bring this up here and perhaps clear up a few things.

First off, here is an actual interaction I had with an attendee.

It was the busiest day of the convention and our game had already booked up all of its demo slots by mid-morning. Unfortunately, that meant I had to disappoint a lot of people, most of whom were really cool about it and many of whom remarked on how awesome it was that we were so popular. It was at this point that an American Lady approached us.

Me = Me / AL = American Lady

AL: ""Hi, I'd like to book a slot for your game""

Me: ""I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we're fully booked up for the whole day, but...""

AL: ""Can I book one for tomorrow then?""

Me: ""Once again, really sorry, but we're only taking on-the-day bookings to give single day ticket holders a fair chance at getting a game. If you come back early tomorrow, I can book you in.""

AL: ""So I'm not special enough to book for tomorrow then?""

Me: ""Nobody is. The only fair way to go about this is to treat everybody equally, but if you...""

AL: ""I see how it is"" *proceeds to storm away in a tantrum*

I wish this was an isolated incident, but it was by no means the only time I saw this kind of interaction.

I realise most of you already know this and I'm effectively preaching to the choir, but the demo guys at conventions are almost all volunteers, giving up their whole weekend to add a little bit of variety to your con. You don't need to thank them, after all, they want to be there, but at least be nice to them.

This kind of behaviour is not cool when visited upon actual paid employees, but it's really quite indefensible to speak to a volunteer like that. I'd hate to think that some bright-eyed, young, first-time demonstrator might be put off of ever volunteering again because some mean attendee made them feel like crap.

I get it. It's humid, stuffy, noisy in the hall. You've just had to re-mortgage your apartment to afford an overpriced cheeseburger and a cup of stale coffee, and now that game you really wanted to try out is denied you, despite you paying a fair bit of cash for a ticket to attend, but it isn't anyone's fault.

It certainly isn't the fault of the happy, smiling nerd who would have informed you that the whole team had volunteered to run games in a local bar all evening for those who were disappointed, had you only let him finish any of his sentences.
