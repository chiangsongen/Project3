How did I fuck up? Well, now I have to support the darn thing!

I greatly enjoy reading stories that are posted on subreddits like /r/tifu.
What I like less is reading these on my computer. Both old and new reddit put too much clutter around text and the formatting itself always feels less than ideal for long pieces of text. 

A while ago I had a realization *""I can fix this!""*,  which is what I promptly set out to do. I started out with a bit of custom css, then I realized I could do better with some scripting. That sort of spiraled out of control and before I knew it I had made it in a full blown browser extension.  

# So what does this extension do?

**tl;dr** it adds beautiful and clean reading mode to reddit posts and comments!

The extension takes text posts or comments and transforms the text from [this](https://www.creesch.com/dump/img/img_5c37109ddbe6c.png) into something more readable with less distractions [like this](https://www.creesch.com/dump/img/img_5c3ba528d9dbe.png)

Or if you are more into dark themes [it will actually look like this](https://www.creesch.com/dump/img/img_5c3ba502b7c7c.png)

It is even somewhat ""smart"" about how it grabs the text, so when you encounter one of those authors who didn't have enough space and needed to continue as replies to their original story it will also include the text from those comments! It does this by going over the comments in posting order, picking those made by the author (if there are any) and adding those to the story. It repeats that for child comments until the entire story has been combined. 




# Features

- Works on both old and redesigned reddit.
- Has a light and dark mode.
- Allows you to choose your own font.
- Adjustable font size.
- Adjustable text width. 
- Works on both text posts and comments.

- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readable-text-posts-on-re/kpffhggoghnmcbofgjdccdgflkodakkj)

# So how do I make it work? 

There a few methods actually! You can activate it for a text post, all the top level comments in a post or just one specific comment. 

Activating for a text post or all the top level comments is done through the [floating button](https://creesch.com/dump/img/img_5c370f60503b6.png) on the bottom right corner when you are visiting a post. Once you hover over it [you get to choose between text posts or comments](https://www.creesch.com/dump/img/img_5c3a68c84cc4e.png). 

If you just want to read an individual comment you can click on the ""read"" link that has been added to it. 


# Open source

The thing is entirely open source, the [source can be found here](https://github.com/creesch/readReddit). 

# Future plans 

- Make the button position a setting. 
- Setting to only show the button in selected subreddits
- Custom themes.

tifu,"Maybe this is over dramatic, but I will forever feel horrible for this.

For some background, my kitten Bones is the runt of our latest litter, and is 10 weeks old. She’s really tiny, about half the size of her siblings. I say ‘mentally-challenged’ because she’s kind of stupid. By this I mean she walks into walls, off of edges, and into our other pets- and is completely stunned by this. She has to take a whole minute to figure out how to jump a short distance. At first we thought she was blind, but it turns out she’s just kind of slow I guess. When she wants attention or food she headbutts the wall. When she ‘runs’ she opens her mouth to breath and drools everywhere. She’s also somewhat cross-eyed, and also walks really weird, with her tail straight up, back legs bent like she’s crouching, and her ass half-way to the ground. We actually even named her Bones because when she walks, her hip bone juts out in a way that it’s very prominent. 
We took her to the vet last week, and he said she was perfectly healthy now besides breathing problems, but we should watch out for possible seizures in the future. He thinks she probably got dropped by her mom when she was a few days old, and that could be why she’s kind of weird.

So anyways, she’s my favorite little kitten out of the litter. Even though she’s quirky, she’s very loving and fun to play with. Her favorite thing to do is curl up against my neck and cuddle. 
Two days ago at 4 AM I had just finished binging GoT and went to go throw away the wrapper of a popsicle I’d eaten. She’s small enough to fit in my palm, so I got lazy and was carrying her and holding the popsicle wrapper in the same hand. This was a really stupid decision. 

I popped open the metal trash can and without even thinking, threw her and the wrapper in the trash. I didn’t even register it until I heard a loud thunk and strained ‘mrow’. It hit me and I rushed to turn the light on I could pull the top off and see inside. This happened to be the same night my mom decided to clear all the leftovers from the fridge into the trash can. So she was covered in a ton of old, sloppy food (mostly enchiladas and spaghetti). She also had somehow hit her face. She had a really bloody nose she kept sneezing from and I swear her head had a little bump that looked dark under the fur.

I panicked and took her to the bathroom to wipe her down. The second she heard the water she scratched the hell out of my hand and pissed and shit all over herself. I felt horrible. I got a washcloth and wiped her down the best I could, but she wasn’t happy at all and her bloody nose kept going. 
It eventually stopped but I still felt like shit. She didn’t trust me for the rest of the night or the next day, and kept running away from me. She didn’t eat at all and only laid in the same place. I was so scared I had given her severe brain damage or something crazy. She warmed up to me again, but I will forever feel horrible.

Also the scratches she gave me got infected and pus-filled, so there’s that. I deserve it. 

Tl;dr: Was too lazy to hold my runty and mentally challenged kitten and trash in different hands, so I accidentally threw her into a metal trash can so hard I gave her a horrible bloody nose and bump. Also got infected scratches from trying to help her, which I more than deserve.

EDIT: Bones is okay!! She’s still being her derpy self, walking off beds and into walls. Nothing is broken and she isn’t in any pain! She’s eating and running just like before :)
(Also fixed the post because my sister reminded me that she’s 10 weeks, not 8)

EDIT 2: Since so many of you asked, here she is!
https://imgur.com/gallery/9vy8T36

EDIT 3: I have decided I’m going to make up for this horrendous sin by dedicating the rest of my life to making sure she’s healthy, happy, and loved.

EDIT 4: I’m really sorry for flooding this posts with edits, but I’d like to keep you all informed. The commenters telling me I should get her checked anyways are right. Next week when Bones goes to get shots, I will have the vet check her out and I’m also going to ask about the chance of her still being potentially blind (many of you pointed out her unfocused eyes) and Cerebullar Hypoplasio (which her mama also has!). Because a week is a long time to be in potential pain, I’m having my mom’s friend (another vet) come over tomorrow to check her out and hopefully give me the brands of potential painkillers she can safely take as a baby. 
Thank you all for the advice and support! ❤️

LAST EDIT: I’ve already gotten a dozen or so comments asking (or rudely insulting and demanding) that I fix her mama because she could be breeding if she has a neurological disorder. And I completely agree! 
But the problem here is that Bones’ mama isn’t my cat. She’s my sister’s cat, and my sister is refusing to fix her. She actually was going to, but then we found out she was pregnant with Bones’ litter, and spaying a preggo cat = murder in my sister’s eyes, I guess. 
I fully plan on spaying Bones ASAP! I disagree with breeding and if I could fix my sister’s cat, I would.

tifu,"I’m a kindergarten teacher with a class of 19 hellions who give me a run for my money every day. Almost 2 weeks ago a fight broke out among a couple kids over some dumb thing or another while we were walking back inside the building after recess so I had to deal with that but could also hear suspicious giggling coming from the back of the line. We finally made it back into the classroom, the kids scattered and started screaming, and the next thing I know there were about a dozen ladybugs crawling all over the rug. These ding dongs had them trapped in their sweaty, grubby hands for who knows how long, and I was just thankful none of them had died. I immediately poked a ziplock full of holes with a thumbtack and dumped them in vowing to put them back outside after school. I ended up completely forgetting about them until today during my end of the year classroom clean out. The bag had gotten buried under a stack of papers on top of the cubby where I’d left them and all the ladybugs were dead except for one which was miraculously still alive! Except that I realized the others had bits missing and others were reduced to what I can only describe as crumbs. I let the surviving ladybug out of the bag and it walked around my hand for a few seconds before flying off in a frenzy, which I have never seen a ladybug do before. I can only imagine what was going through its mind after suddenly being released after 2 weeks of pure misery. 

TL;DR I tried to rescue a dozen ladybugs my students had brought inside from the playground by putting them in a plastic bag but forgot about them for 2 weeks and they all died except one who may have eaten the others.",TIFU by causing the deaths of nearly a dozen ladybugs and forcing one of them into cannibalism (maybe).
tifu,"So this happened today and I’m super embarrassed by it but here goes.

So about two weeks ago I got an awesome tattoo on my lower arm. Now I work in a professional office, so I wear a suit every day, so none of my coworkers know about any of my tattoos, much less this one. 

This is my first time getting a tattoo and having to wear a suit every day, so it presented some challenges. Most notably - the itch. From day 4-14 it’s pretty itchy, and it’s uncomfortable in a suit. No problem though, that’s what lotion is for. 

So I brought in a bottle of lotion to work so I could lotion up during the day, and when it gets bad, I would just run to the bathroom, wash my hands, jump in a stall, lotion up, let it air dry a minute and go back to work. However, it’s a busy week, so in most cases I had to wait until I needed to go to hop in. Not a big deal, so I thought....

**what my coworkers saw:** me looking uncomfortable and wound up during the day, then grabbing a bottle of lotion and heading into the bathroom, then coming out all cool and relieved. Yup, they thought I was going in to do *that* deed. 

The funny thing, it was only a small group and no one said anything until at lunch today, when we were making small talk. I mentioned that I had gotten a tattoo and was finally mostly healed, only a few more days of lotion and I’m good. I saw them all have the “ohhhhhhhhh” moment at the same time. “That makes a lot more sense ElonMuskPaddleBoard!” They all thought I was having some weird issues and needed to relieve myself mid day. 

**tl;dr** I was going to the bathroom during work with a bottle of lotion to rub on my tattoo but my coworkers thought I was going in to wank",TIFU by making my coworkers think I was going into the bathroom to masturbate for the past week
tifu,"Now this TIFU didn't happen today, it was a couple of weeks ago and I am still struggling to come to terms with the embarrassment, for both me and my girlfriend.

So, a few weeks ago I was at my GF's house, usually the plan when I go is I sit around with her parents for around 30mins-1hr or so with just general chatting etc then we go off to her room to watch TV, play games and other stuff. Everything was normal, I chat to her parents then go up to her room with her and start watching general TV.

This is where the fuck up happens.

After around an hour or so, me and my GF were bored and she was feeling pretty horny today (not normal behaviour, especially whilst her parents are home) and begins to undress me and start giving me a handjob.

I'm enjoying this more than I ever have, most likely because of the risk factor involved with her parents being home, which just made it feel so much better. Although the risk wasn't huge, because her parents have never disturbed us once since I started going there, they just leave us to it but still, the slight risk just made it feel really good.

She starts kissing my chest, them down to my waist and then starts sucking my dick. Literally within less than 30 seconds, I'm already ready to release my load, I try to get her to slow down and stop to save my embarrassment from prematurely ejacating but I just can't, it feels too good. 

Right on queue, her door starts to open so my girlfriend quickly stops, in walks her mother to ask us a question about going out for dinner together... she instantly gets an eye full of my girlfriend on her knees on the bed next to my dick whilst I'm there in my birthday suit. My girlfriend stopped too late though, so whilst she's staring at her mum in shock who's staring at both of us in even more shock I release my load all over my body in front of both of them, and she wasn't even sucking my dick at the time. Not only was it a ruined orgasm, her mother also got to see the final credits. Her mother didn't even say a word, she just walked back out and closed the door behind her.

I sit there completely naked, covered in my own cum in just pure embarrassment. My girlfriend went to get me tissue to sort myself out and then I hid in her room until they had gone to sleep and it was time to leave.

Although me and my GF are still together, I haven't been back or spoken to them since :(

tifu,"A couple of months ago, my boyfriend’s mom was supposed to pick me up to drive me to drive me to meet my boyfriend and then drive us both to the airport. We live together in an apartment about an hour from his parents’ house. I did a little extra cleaning in the living room area. We have cats so I vacuumed and what-not in case she decided to come inside even though I hoped I would just run out to the car. 

She shows up and inevitably wants to come inside and she has my boyfriend’s younger sister with her. His sister is 22 so she’s not super young or anything. She says she has to use the restroom. We live in a two bedroom, two bathroom apartment with a third roommate. Each bathroom is inside each bedroom so she had to go through my bedroom to use the restroom. I knew the bedroom and bathroom were a little messy so I spent like 5 minutes telling her we should get on the road and that she didn’t want to see our room because we’ve been busy and haven’t done laundry for a while. She insists on using the restroom saying that she cleans houses for a living and promises that she’s seen worse and that she’s used to blocking everything out. 

The mother and sister then both go into my room and the sister sits on my bed and we’re talking while the mom is using the restroom. The mom comes out of the restroom and we all talk for 5 minutes or so. They compliment me on decorations around the room and then head to the car while I collect my bags. As I’m collecting my bags, I’m mad at myself for how bad the room looks and then I see it. 

The vibrator. The bright purple, dildo-shaped vibrator that I had charging on top of the nightstand that they both most definitely saw. Then, I got in the car with both of them who were both oddly quiet, texted my boyfriend to tell him what happened, and sat there completely mortified for the entire ride. We never spoke of the incident and to this day it haunts me.

TL;DR My boyfriend’s mom and sister came inside our apartment and through our bedroom to use the restroom unexpectedly while my bright purple, dildo-shaped vibrator was on top of the nightstand charging. I then was forced to sit in a weirdly quiet car with them both for another hour afterwards.","TIFU by charging my bright purple, dildo-shaped vibrator in open view when my boyfriend’s mom and sister came to visit [NSFW]"

While I was cleaning the shower my ass had hit the life alert TWICE while the resident of the home was outside!

My mom was in the other room and I'm always making shitty rhymes to make everyone cringe because I find it funny.

Ok I just want to start this off by saying I fucked up because now I have lots of questions and I don't have the answers, maybe Reddit can help.

So this weekend I was up at the cottage and because it's deep in Quebec there's basically no cell service for my provider. Luckily we do have WiFi because there is internet service up there. So one night I got drunk and later that night I started watching porn on my phone over the WiFi. Just as I was almost there the WiFi cuts out and I'm stuck without porn to jerk it to. Frantically I checked my phone to see if I had anything on it to do the job with and all I could find was a video I sent a girl once (because she asked) of me jerking it. So I started jerking it to a video of myself jerking it. About 30 seconds into it I was amazed at how well this was doing it for me, I was really getting off on watching myself originally because it looked bigger in the video than it usually it is but after a bit I noticed I was really getting turned on by the sight of me jerking my own pole. I finished before I did in the video and that was that I went to bed.

Sunday morning I packed everything up and headed back home. Later that night I couldn't sleep so I grabbed my phone and went onto Pornhub but sadly the videos I found weren't doing it for me. After about 20 minutes of searching for the right video to spank it to I remembered the night before and how I was able to finish watching myself. At first I thought it was only out of desperation that I was able to finish because I had nothing else at the time but I thought what the hell, I've tried everything else at this point. So I turned on the video and attempted to get myself off again. To my amazement it worked and even quicker than before. Sadly that didn't help me sleep. At first I was up thinking to myself ""Am I gay?"" because I was getting off on video of dude wacking it. I don't think so because I've never been attracted to men. My next thought was that ""Am I just really egotistical?"". Now that I've tried this can I only ever get off by looking at myself? Is this normal?

tifu,"This FU happened two days ago. On mobile, fist post to this sub, English is my first language, TL;DR at bottom. It’s a long one, so strap on your helmets and get ready for a wild and bumpy ride folks.

I (25f) took a weekend trip with some girlfriends to a small beach town for some sunshine and relaxation. Upon arrival, we rode bicycles to the beach and found a nice little beach bar to unwind. We enjoyed some beers and liquor over a card game. That’s when we decided to make it interesting. We came to the conclusion that whoever scored lowest in our game of rummy had to complete a dare.

Well guess who lost (yours truly) and got dared to ride my bike home, sans bikini top. I 100% support the #freethenipple movement, and figured there were other topless females on the beach, so no harm done, right? Who doesn’t love to see a pair of tits? The top came off and I mounted my bike, like a fearless warrior woman to her trusty steed. I gave my purse to my friend to hold so that I could let the twins roam freely on the ride (this part is important for later).

All was well on the initial adventure home, boobies flopping in the wind, a jiggle here and there with every bump in the road. Many people stared in shock and awe, some very clearly enjoying the view. My friends behind me, laughing as they watched the faces of surprised onlookers. Although, there were some older ladies that were not amused with the fact that I was proudly exhibiting my flawless funbags. This is where the real FU begins.

The police were contacted and made aware of my fun and freaky escapade, and must have been keeping their eyes peeled (come on, who wouldn’t). We had to pass through a main part of town to return to our residence for the weekend. Alas, I was spotted. I quickly put my dress back on as they began to approach me. My fight or flight must have kicked in, and looked at my friends and said “let’s book it”.

We biked up and down the streets, trying to keep the fuzz off our tails. In the midst of riding throughout all the back alleys, I not only successfully lost the cops, but I accidentally lost my friends. Fuck. I continued to look for the residence, but to no avail. My bike took me swiftly down an alley and turned one last fateful corner. The flashing blue lights and two men standing right in front of me meant the gig was up. The cops picked me up off my bike and tossed me in the backseat of the cop car.

Now, this is a fairly small town with the majority of the population being older folks. As you can imagine, there isn’t much going on at the police station. This meant they had all the time in the world to take their sweet ass time to process me. It didn’t help that I was pickpocketed a few weeks ago, and only have my passport for identification (didn’t bring it on the trip, it’s locked in a safe in my main residence a few towns away). Luckily, I keep pictures of my important documents on my phone. Remember how my friend had my purse? Yeah, I had no phone to prove my identity.

The next few hours of processing were frustrating, yet entertaining. I laughed, I cried, I made some (kinda) friends. The station was really casual, they let me walk around and chat with them. Mugshot and fingerprints were taken. Called my phone, got a hold of my friend, she brought my purse and helped me get out. After getting the bicycle, we all went to get pizza and popped some champagne to celebrate getting out scotch free. Went to the beach the next day and I played my ukulele with my titties out. The warm sun felt delightful dancing upon my bosom, as I strummed and sipped on an ice cold beer.

TL;DR I fucked up by riding my bike topless, running from the cops, and getting arrested in a foreign country

tifu,"So a little bit of backstory is required for this post.  It's sad, but it has to be done.

Last year, my father passed away due to complications related to his exposure to Agent Orange. He had been a military man most of his adult life, and served with distinction during his year in Vietnam.  Three bronze stars are not an easy thing to come by.  Unfortunately, during that time the area around his deployment was heavily defoliated by Agent Orange, so he was basically marinated in the stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

It was difficult watching this vibrant, intelligent, loving man deteriorate into constant pain, suffering from chronic bursitis, diabetes, emphysema, his mind going inch by fragile inch. The last five years had been hell for him, and for my mom.  Still, he did his best to stay as busy as he could, volunteering with local charities and taking on as much responsibility as he could.  He even adopted a little chihuahua from the local pound, a sausage of a dog that he named Missy.  She loved him more than anything, and kept him active by playing, forcing him on walks, or just snoozing in his lap while he watched TV.  

&amp;#x200B;

He had surgery for a spinal stimulator on a Monday, and was sent home to rest.  The pain was absolutely unbearable for him, and he could barely sit.  From what Mom told me, he didn't sleep nearly at all in the last few days of his life, and he even had to have  a catheter inserted due to the pain pills he was on. Apparently, the pills can sometimes cause a person's bladder to shut down.  Thursday afternoon, he was heading to the doctor to have the catheter removed, when he stumbled down the front steps of his house, hit his head, and that was really it. That big beautiful caring heart couldn't take  anymore.  And Missy, his loving chihuahua watched it all from the front window, barking as the ambulance came and took him away.  That night, and for any nights after, she stood by the front door or curled up in his favorite chair, just crying and whining.

&amp;#x200B;

I've moved back in with my Mom to help her take care of the house. It's a big old country-style house, with a huge yard that she couldn't handle on her own.  When I lived a few towns away, I'd come over once a week and mow, but now I can do all the yard work, fix the toilets, the ceilings, etc.  I'm single, so it's not been a great trouble, and she likes having someone around. Plus Missy has adopted me, and does all the stuff she did with Dad.  It's a great arrangement.

&amp;#x200B;

So it's been a little over a year since Dad passed away, and Mom was out of town visiting my sister and some cousins, and I have the weekend off.  I didn't feel like visiting friends, or having them come over here, so just been puttering around the computer, watching videos, playing a game or two, etc.  Missy was asleep on the floor behind me in her dog bed, only getting up when she wanted loving or to beg me for a treat.  I was thinking about Dad, and was thinking how ephemeral life truly is, how many will never hear the voices of loved ones again.  Then I remembered that I'd recorded Dad for a podcast a friend of mine and I used to do, interviewing him for the work he'd done in Folklore over his life.  He was a storyteller as a hobby, and had gone all over Ohio to tell the ghost stories he'd collected over the years.  

&amp;#x200B;

So without thinking of anything besides just wanting to hear my Dad's voice again, I loaded up the podcast and started listening.  Next thing I know I nearly got bowled out of my chair by a very ecstatic chihuahua. She was leaping onto my lap, yapping and bouncing as she tried to get to the computer speakers. Daddy was in there! RIGHT THERE!  And of \*COURSE\* that's when in the recording past Missy came trotting in, and my Dad said, ""Hi Missy!""

&amp;#x200B;

I still feel horrible.  I hadn't even thought about how this might affect her.  She's spent the rest of the day at the front window, staring out, ears perked, waiting for her Daddy who will never come home.

TLDR; I played a recording of my deceased Dad's voice, and his dog heard it and is now waiting for him to come home.

EDIT: Thank you all for the kind words. I'm sorry if i made some of your cry.  Anyway, as requested, here's the podcast:

So one day, I wake up hella late and don't have time to put on makeup (9th grade, first time not wearing makeup to high school). My friends don't really even notice though, they just think I'm sick or have given up on trying.

I go straight to my math class and am four minutes late, tops. My teacher tells me I have to go to the office and get a tardy note. Oof. I head into the office and say,
""Can I get a late slip?"" The lady starts squinting at me.

""Are you in the play?"" At this point I realize they're actually gonna make me take a late slip for being four minutes late and now I have to do detention for not having an excuse.

""No. Are you thinking I'm Tristan?"" I look a lot like this girl who's playing the lead in the Alice in Wonderland play and get mistaken for her by some of the teachers.

""No... It's just... You've got an awful lot of makeup on... It just makes your face look so white. I think it might be distracting to the other students."" I think smoke starts to come out of my tear ducts as my brain tries to work out what she just said.

""I'm not wearing makeup."" This is pretty much the only response I can come up with. She looks at me like I just tried to buy cigarettes at a store with my mom's ID.

""I just think maybe you should take some off so you don't distract the students. It's very pale."" I'm now glaring at her with our eyes locked. My face is a darker color than my arm. I'm slightly offended so I just wanna leave.

""Can I just have my late slip?"" She looks annoyed and says,

""I'm sorry. You'll distract the other kids."" I'm a little shocked at this point.

""I can't go to class because I'm too pale?"" She rolls her eyes and says,

""That's just way too much makeup for school.""

I fucking leave. My bad for being too white, mam.

TL;DR Apparently, without makeup, I'm too pale for an education.",TIFU by being too white to go to school.
tifu,"Me and my boyfriend haven't had sex for a few week im heavily pregnant and I can't really do it right now because I get cramps during it. Anyway today I told my boyfriend I was going to bed because I was tired.

I came downstairs for a drink and thought I'd check up on him, I opened the livingroom door and he must not have heard me coming down the stairs because he had his fleshlight wedged between the sofa pillows and was having sex with it. While he had porn playing on his phone.

Never seen him do this before but he seemed to get really embarassed. I guess the only bad part for me is I can now imagine what walking in on him having an affair would look like now. Personally I don't mind it, his sex drive needs satisfying and I'm in no state to have sex right now.

He went bright red and later asked me if we could just pretend it didn't happen. I told him I'd hold it for him next time and laughed, he wasn't ammused.

tifu,"This fuck up happened over 20 years ago... so yes. Not quite recent 

Our family has gone fishing since the dawn of time. It’s what we do with an open week of vacation. Same lake, same times of year.

However this particular trip it was just my Grandfather and myself. I had to have been maybe 13 or 14 at the time.

We went out as per custom around dawn. I was in the front while we was in the back, trolling and getting us where we needed to go. 

What I remember was I had an itch, down there, and went to scratch but instead of that simple act ending for one reason or another I continued to “scratch... I had no idea what was happening but whatever it was it felt nice so I proceeded to simply rub with a single finger. 

The process took awhile but I VIVIDLY remember the sheer panic/confusion/pleasure as that first ejaculation happened and in shame/confusion I hopped up not knowing what happened and turned to my Grandfather to ask what in the fuck just happened.

The look on his stoic face told the tale. There I was in my basketball shorts... hard on and a wet spot.

He asked me to sit down, then proceeded to ask more questions about what I was doing. I explained best I could and he told me then what had happened.

We drove back to the dock, tied up and I went inside to clean up.

With my face completely red I’m sure I came back out trying to play it cool but he wanted to talk more.

He gave me more information on the changes I was experiencing, the urges I will have and what I can expect. He wasn’t upset and truth be told it was never brought up again. 

TLDR: I unknowingly jerked off 6 feet away from my Papa on a fishing trip as a child.

tifu,"TIFU, and it actually happened today. I was driving with my 12 year old daughter. We got caught at a red light next to a restaurant. I glanced at the restaurant and saw a kid walking in the parking lot by himself. It looked like my daughter’s friend Gabe. I said to her, “is that...” and before I could even finish, she said yes. 

So I suggested we say hi to him. I rolled down my window and screamed “Gabe!” The kid turned around, and that’s when I realized it wasn’t Gabe. It was a younger boy, maybe 9 years old. 

So here’s the thing. This kid isn’t Gabe. God only knows if he’s even heard the name Gabe before. And it’s a busy intersection, so it’s noisy. 

The kid had such a puzzled and embarrassed look on his face, and he ran to his car. And that’s when I realized, this 9 year old kid thinks a middle aged woman just rolled down her car window, screamed “gay!!!” at him, and drove away. My daughter laughed her ass off at me. 

TL;DR: I called an elementary school kid gay while stopped at a red light.

tifu,"Without giving away too much the company I work for was finalizing a gas well when a member of my team made a critical mistake sending the wrong type of chemical into the well earlier then what was specified.

The employee in question is moving onto a different company in 9 days and his head hasn't been in the game since he gave his notice. Prior to the job I triple checked he knew what was going where and when and he was sure.

Fast forward to the job itself we called for the first chemical and all went apparently smooth until I checked on the employee and noticed the stage 2 chemical went down first. I made the call to shut everything down and pumping everything out of the well in turn saving it.

My head office is loosing they're mind over it and the customers head office is just the same. Best part is, said employee walked off the job saying he quit once he realized what happened.

That was almost 10 hours ago and these types of jobs non productive time cost is astronomical. Currently waiting on the top brass from both companies to make it to location to figure out what to do. Because I was in charge of this crew I'm likely gonna be canned because it is my fault I wasn't there to hold his hand.

Basically her brother dies of a suicide in Maryland, we live in Georgia. RIP. She takes a week off of work to grieve and to attend the funeral. Me being a good friend and all, I giving her support and a shoulder to cry on. fast forward two weeks, she's returned and is attempting to go back to her old routine. I recently acquired a new iphone and was selling my old one. Sammy over heard this and demanded I sell her the phone. She's not very good with technology and was having difficulty transferring stuff from phone A to phone B. I offer my help, as any iPhone user, I upload everything to the icloud and download it to the new phone. When I THOUGHT I transferred everything, I proceed to erase phone A. After a couple minutes, Sammy is in tears, I freak out and try to comfort her only to realize I transferred everything BUT her voicemails. Which contained over a dozen voicemails from her brother who JUST DIED. I go into full panic mode trying to recover what ever I can. Regretting erasing phone A, I feel like a compete dick and apologize for the next week.

tifu,"As with most TIFU's, this didn't happen today but earlier this year on Easter Sunday.

As a preface, I sometimes send my fiance porn gifs when he's away from his phone to get him in the mood or just to tease. Usually I'll just browse a porn subreddit, and send him multiple gifs/vids as I find one's I think he'd like.

On to the FU.

It was Easter Sunday. I had sent my fiancé's father a ""happy Easter"" text earlier that day.

Now, it's worth noting I don't text a lot of people other than the fiance. So his name is usually at the top of my ""recent text"" box.

Fiance had gone upstairs to do something, so I decided to take the opportunity to leave him some surprises to get him in the mood for later.

Off I go to r/blowjobs, sort by top, and I sent 6 links quickly just switching between reddit and my text message app (sending each individual link as it's own text), before something caught the corner of my eye... The name, seemed a lot longer than it should be... Realizing my mistake milliseconds after I sent the 7th link. 

Foolish me, managed to send a grand total of 7 porn links in quick succession to my fiancé's father...

As hubby comes back downstairs I realize the horror of my ways, burying my face in my hands as I curse myself.

Concerned, hubby asks what's wrong, after a minute to regain composure I manage to tell him my error. He finds it hysterical and tells me to just send a follow up. I can't. I can't ever look his father in the eye again let alone text the man. Hubby gracefully takes my phone and sends a follow up apology/warning text imploring him not to open any links he may have just recieved.

He (fiance's father) never said a word. Not a one. Not to this day has he even so much as acknowledged it. 

We are supposed to see him this Thursday (have not really interacted with him since the Easter FU) and I still don't know how the man feels about me after spamming him with porn.

We start kissing heavy when she motions for me to touch her down under. I’m into it and I thought she was too by her verbal feedback. Within the span of 30 seconds the Oos went to Ahhs to AHHHHH and panicked screaming “IT BURNS”.

tifu,"Titled as it is because it feels indelicate to phrase it properly, throwaway because I definitely don't want anyone I know knowing I did this. But hey, it's kind of a funny story and maybe it'll make people laugh.

&amp;#x200B;

This happened this past January or December, I don't remember which. It's winter, it's cold as fuck, and to top it off I've got no radiator. I'm wearing this really lovely jumper to keep warm. It's late at night, around midnight, and I'm headed up to bed. I pour some water into a mug to drink before I sleep, but also to have my antidepressants with in the morning (swallowing pills with water, you know how it is). Get myself cosy into bed and, well, that all too familiar urge rears its ugly head. So I get out my laptop, find the right video, and go to town. Might as well, right? Still wearing my jumper because it's freezing, but above the duvet.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently something about that night or that video really did it for me, I suppose. When Vesuvius erupts, it's with quite some force. It got a couple places where I wouldn't have wanted (mostly on the duvet), which I was quick to clean up, but I was certain I had noticed some fly in the direction of my jumper.

&amp;#x200B;

I searched my jumper for sticky white stuff for a long time (the color wouldn't have made it easy to see it even with the lights on), maybe five minutes, before concluding that it must have somehow missed it. The jumper was spotless. Maybe the bit I saw went on duvet I had already cleaned up, maybe it would be later discovered on my sheets, maybe it was just a figment of my imagination? But everywhere I could see had been cleaned up or had always been fine.

&amp;#x200B;

""Out of sight, out of mind"", I supposed. Settled down into bed, decidedly warmer after getting underneath my duvet and an extra blanket, and went to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Woke up the next morning after a good amount of sleep, got out of bed in reasonable time, was about to head downstairs to make coffee and breakfast when I remember I need to take my pill. Got it out of its packaging, threw it down my gullet, and downed it with what remained of the water in the mug.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I dunno if y'all have ever swallowed cum that's been chilling out overnight in cold water in a porcelain mug in a freezing room. That stuff stuck to the back of my throat for dear life. Nothing dangerous, blocking airways or anything, but jesus what an unpleasant sensation. Made even worse when it eventually hit me that the one that got away, which I had been searching for, had been lying in wait for its revenge. I was currently semi-gagging on my own semen.

&amp;#x200B;

There was no getting it out, and god knows I'm not reaching fingers in there. So I headed to the bathroom and just... kept refilling and drinking down my mug until my throat felt \*almost\* not-gross. Showered and repeated the gargle-spit cycle at least a dozen times.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah. No dire consequences but it certainly felt like a fuck up (if a somewhat minor one). Gross, but hopefully funny to you guys.

tifu,"Like all TIFUs go, happened few years back when I was around 16. We had a family gathering and I had a buncha cousins who were around 7-12 in ages. I was close with only one of them because he shared the same interests I had and we occasionally played Pokémon together.

Anyhow, I was hanging around near the adults table, occasionally accepting the alcohol provided by the drunk uncle who thinks I'm over 18, listening to trash talk about sports teams, politics and feeling all adultish when the cousin that I'm close with comes to me and asks for some help. He tells me the story of how my other cousin, let's name him Jim, 9, is getting bullied at school everyday and he's doing nothing.

I talk to Jim about this and asks if he has told his parents and he claimed that his dad adviced that talking is the best solution and to sort it out with words.

'pfft. Words.' I thought. Fuelled by alcohol and the macho to be the bigger, cooler cousin, I straight up tell my 9 year old cousin, to walk up behind the bully and smack him in the head with his pencil case as hard as he can.

Honestly, I wasn't thinking or in my right mind here at all. Firstly, what the hell was that gonna do except make the bully even madder? It's a pencil case. I haven't even seen Jim's pencil case but I assumed it's a normal cloth one with a zipper.

The kids seemed impressed by my don't take no shit attitude and started talking about the course of attack while I went back to my vice of underage drinking.

Fast forward 3 days. I get a phone call from my mum saying that Jim's school principal wants to meet me. Confused as fuck, I walk into the school and the principals office to see a massive steel toolbox on top of the table, filled with stationary and noticeably concerned principal, my cousins' parents, two other adults who were the parents of the kid my cousin has apparently hospitalised with a concussion to the head by smacking him in the head with his pencil case as per my instruction.

If I knew that was the pencil case Jim had, I would have told him stab the guy with a knife. Probably would have caused less damage.

Thank fuck the parents of the bully turned out to be the nicest human beings in the planet and since the doctor has informed that no permenant damage has been done (because Jim was a scrawny tween) and the fact they learnt that their son had been bullying Jim, they accepted a heartfelt apology and we got off with just a warning.

Jim's parents haven't let Jim hang out with me ever since.

tifu,"About a week ago I interviewed for an open manager position at a different location within my company. It’s the job I’ve been wanting for the past several years, and would not only be a pretty significant pay bump but would also shave about 45 minutes off of my commute each direction. My main competition was Old Guy (OG), who had been the assistant to the guy whose job I was applying for. I’ve only ever met OG in passing, and all I really knew is that he had been with the company for a really long time. 

Fast forward to today, when I’m supposed to hear back on whether or not I got the job. I’m at my desk and I see the Big Boss’ phone number pop up on my phone. SURPRISE! They offer me the position, and I accept. I was totally ecstatic. The second I was off the phone I was getting kudos from my coworkers and planning how I was going to celebrate. Only a few minutes later, I get a chat message from Female Coworker (FC) that reads: “WTF, you’re going to be my dad’s boss???” 

(Backstory: I matched with FC on Tinder about 6 months ago, and found out that we both worked at different branches of the same company. We immediately bonded by talking massive amounts of shit about the people in the company we hated, and the date ended with us hooking up. Didn’t lead anywhere romantically, but we still flirt casually via our company IM chat.)

Me: “Wait what? Your dad works at the X location???”

Her: “He’s Previous Boss’s assistant!”

So not only did I get this promotion over OG, a man 30 years my senior with more experience and longer tenure:

I also fucked his daughter.

tifu,"This happened about a month ago, but I’m still feeling it today if that helps with the ‘today ‘ part of the TIFU.

About a year ago, my wife of seven years decided that she didn’t want to be married to me anymore and wants to divorce. I struggled, tried to reconcile, prove to her that I could fix every flaw, etc. but she’s had enough. I cried and and refused to give up on her, but she made it very clear that she only wanted me as a father to our child and that’s it. I still love her, and I feel like that a part of me will always love her, and I just want her to be happy even if it means not being with me.

Devastated, I tried to stay positive and look on the bright side. At the very least, I can now get with other women for the first time in over a decade. I haven’t had any intimacy in almost a year, so I felt like I gotta get ‘back in the game’ so to speak. For the first time in years, a girl asked for my number and I gave it to her and we went on a date. She wasn’t super attractive, but I felt like that I could be myself around her, and she told me that she just got out of a serious relationship too. When we were alone, we started fooling around and things got heavy quickly.

I ate her out and she loved it! I enjoyed it too since I felt like that I ‘still got it.’ However, when she returned the favor, she was rough and didn’t really know what she was doing and I failed to realize it at the time. She was ‘massaging ‘ my balls, and I feel like she was pulling them in uneasy directions and was wearing out the tough skin that’s around where the bottom of the penis is. She was also not gentle with my penis, not using enough lube or spit and it was something that I wasn’t terribly comfortable with. I thought, maybe this is how people have ‘rough ‘ sex? Nope. Rough is one thing, painful is another. I also thought that since it’s been almost a year since I’ve had any intimacy that maybe I’m out of practice? Also no. If something is wrong down there, you’ll know right away and you should speak up for yourself. I didn’t want to ruin the mood or hurt her feelings, so I just let her continue on(dumb mistake). Despite all this inadequacy, I was still able to cum on her, and I thought that things were starting to look up. 

Unfortunately, I started to get concerned when I tried getting with her again a few days later and I couldn’t get it up(embarrassed, I just ate her out a bunch of times until the point where she could barely walk and she wouldn’t mind my penis not answering the call). I also didn’t wake up with morning wood in about a week, so I decided to go to my doctor and a urologist. I got tested and it came back negative, so it’s not STD related. They told me that I would need about 6-8 weeks to recover, and it’s been about two weeks since I saw them. I have been able to have erections both prompted and unprompted, and I even woke up with morning wood once. So things are looking up, but it still hurts down there sometimes. I don’t think I’m going to do one night stands anymore, and if anyone is doing anything that I’m not okay with down there I am going to speak up about it. I suppose I was just so damn eager and desperate for any sort of female companionship that I was willing to ‘sacrifice’ my favorite regions in some vain attempt to reassure myself that a woman is capable of loving me back again, but I can see that that’s bullshit now. I just wanted to recapture the feeling of making love like I did with my wife, but uncomfortable oral sex with a girl I just met is no substitute and I should just take things easy for a while.....physically, mentally and emotionally. I do feel like a ‘broken’ man, and my self-confidence is low, and even though I’m impatient to get back out there in the dating world, I need some painfully slow recovery time.

I hope y’all have enjoyed my tale of woe, and if you have any genitalia-related recovery stories of hope I would love to hear them so I can have some hope of my own because I could REALLY use it.

So here i am, about a year ago on vacation visiting family in DC and were about to board the plane back. I am just minding my own business and my friend (we will call her sally) texts me. So were just having a nice conversation and she mentions how she was at the store and saw this really cute guy. So she starts talking about it and everything is going fine. She mentions that she got his number, but that he is 19. So que me, being the idiot i am, sending a message saying ""haha so what are you gonna do call him up in 3 years and be like hey its that girl from the store that one time. Wanna fuck?"" So I send it and I hear my dad squeal a little. I look over at him, and there he is with his eyes popping out of his head looking like he is about to have steam screaming out of his ears. I ask whats wrong and he tells me that he is outraged about what i just sent. So I, thinking he was talking about me cussing (which was odd because he doesn't really have a problem with it) asked what the big deal was. This was my fuck up.

It was at that moment I knew there was about to be a scene. He was reading over my shoulder and thought I just said, ""wanna fuck"". So there I was looking like a little helpless kid, with my dad lecturing me extremely loudly, about respecting woman and not sending texts like that. He must have repeated the words sexual predator and sexual abuse about 30 times. For about an hour at our gate entrance he is yelling at me, lecturing me about rape and stuff like that, while I am getting looks from everyone within a 100ft vicinity. Now of course I felt like I just wanted to jump out off the room right then and there, and to make matters worse some people were giving me looks and even nodding in and saying some stuff now and then. So my dad took a break to take my sister to grab some water. So there I am, getting stares from everyone around me, wanting to disappear off the face of the planet because I look like a sexual predator. The worst part is there is a guy who appears to be my age sitting right across from me just flabbergasted with this look on his face. He kind of gave me the sympathy nod, as he seemed to be able to relate and read the situation so that made me feel slightly better.

It took me sending a message to sally to believe me and profusely explaining that I'm not a sexual predator to get him to believe me. It was an awkward plane ride.

I called my husband on the way home and told him what had happened, he assured me it was no big deal.

tifu,"Going to preface this by saying it’s not as savage and adulterous as it sounds. 

My wife and I have been in the USA for a two week holiday. We stayed in an all-inclusive resort and got friendly with other holiday-makers over the fortnight, regularly drinking and doing tours and activities together. 

One of the girls we befriended was a beautiful European girl (being deliberately vague here, this happened *last night*). From the beginning of the holiday, I’d seen her around and as guilty an opinion this is for me to say as a married chap, after a couple of weeks hanging out, she’s one of the most beautiful people I’ve ever met, inside and out. But it’s cool, just another friend. 

Last night, we got carried away drinking, not thinking about how horrible a flight would be hungover. We drunk too much. It was our final night and the little gang we’d formed were all joining in, including said girl. 

As the night drew on to ~ 3 am and the bars closed, we were hammered. And out of nowhere, my wife and this chick start some light kissing. Now, we aren’t a couple into sharing, swinging, 3-ways etc. She isn’t bisexual and honestly I didn’t care as this has never happened before. I was however surprised when this girl turned to me and kissed me. It was slow and brief, with glances at my wife to presumably check a line wasn’t being crossed. She went back to my wife. 

And then she came back to me. This is the TIFU, I guess - perhaps it’s not my fault as I didn’t start the whole thing, but i also didn’t stop it. This time - presumably spurred by the lack of objections last time - was not slow at all. She went for it, as well as getting .. grabby. 

My wife immediately shut that shit down. So yeah, it’s put a little downer on the end of the holiday. Firstly, because my wife has been upset about it today. Secondly, because - and this’ll sound dumb - I can’t get this damn girl out of my head. I’m a married guy and I don’t cheat. I’ll also never see her again, though she gave us both her number for WhatsAp and we left today on friendly terms. I kinda feel like I should keep that number / friendship at arms length, as I haven’t had these kind of raw emotional feelings towards anyone since I met my wife 10 years ago.

Well, until today. A guy and his ~7 year old son come up to my Spot and the guy is acting really.. guarded and asking me to identify myself. It felt like a policeman was interrogating me, what with his tone and demeanor. 

So I did, naturally, and told him I live in the neighborhood, come out here every day, and just leave this thing up cause it became a hassle to take it down (my setup has a bug net and a rain fly). He remained skeptical, and I do not think he was convinced. 

Turns out a little girl was missing for a few hours this past weekend (she's fine!) and during the search the party found my hammock.

tifu,"This happend a few years ago, but today my daughter reminded me of this event ;)

We were in a small city trip in Amsterdam with the whole family. We visited the NEMO ( [https://www.nemosciencemuseum.nl/en/](https://www.nemosciencemuseum.nl/en/) ) with my 2 daughters (5 and 8). After the visit we wanted to grab a bite to eat. So we left the museum to go downtown...

We took the most direct route to our destination... Which lead us right to the ""New Market"" and then a bit further.

We realized we took the wrong turn a bit late. The windows were no longer filled with merchandize or anything like that. Instead of that, we saw some hard working woman in very little clothes. And i mean little clothes. The smell of weed was in the air and our youngest daughter (5) gave the most empathic statement, which is the reason i am sharing this post:

""Those poor woman... Cant they afford any clothes?""

I had such a hard time not laughing on the spot... But we just confirmed her suspicion and left the area ASAP ;)

She had a good laugh today when the topic came up again and we gave her the quote from back then...

tifu,"Let me preface this by saying that I just finished High School. With that out of the way, let's begin.

I  was watching porn at about 9:30 pm. My dad had gone to bed at that  point and I figured that I would be fine. The one thing that I didn't  account for was Mama Bear, as she was at work. Turns out she wasn't. She  walked into my room (where my pc is) and saw what was on my screen and  said ""what the fuck are you watching, I raised my christian boy better  than that."" As soon as she said that I panicked and closed the tab. An  awkward silence filled the room with me praying that she would leave and  wouldn't tell my dad. I'm from a pretty conservative family in terms of ""morality"" as both my parents (with one being a democrat mind you) are both very heavy Christians and raised me (an atheist) as a Christian. They definitely don't approve of porn or anything remotely like it.

tifu,"Like most TIFUs, I am using a throwaway account and this didnt not happen today. Happened a couple days.

A day or two ago, I was outside in my front yard working on some gardening. My neighbors have two little kids who go to kindergarten. One of the kids came over and gave me his soccer ball and we were playing for a bit.

This is where I fucked up. I used to play soccer back in high school, so I kicked the ball with all my strength thinking that my friend was gonna get the ball and not the little kid. Unfortunately I hit the kid with the ball and gave him a black eye.

The kid went crying back, I went with him and told his mom I was sorry, she was okay as she knows accidents happen. Little did she know she was gonna cause an accident herself.

As she was icing his eye, her nail scratched the bottom of the kids eye causing it the bleed a little. No big deal. But the next the day kid, being innocent as he is, told the teacher his mom did that to his eye when the teacher asked what happened.

That afternoon, Child Protection Services (CPS) shows up to my neighbors house to seize custody of the kids. Luckily the people were nice and understood that this was an accident. They even called me over and had me explain to them to make sure our stories matched up. 

Unfortunately CPS has to follow rules and they are require to come to my neighbors house every day for an hour for a few weeks to spend time alone with the kids asking them how their day went and if they are okay.

tifu,"So a few nights ago, I hosted a house party at my place. The party took place for the most part in my basement which has a killer surround set-up. Because of that, I was playing music through my Apple TV. For those that are unfamiliar, the Apple TV remote has a button on it to activate siri as well as a microphone for you to tell siri what you want. Remember that, it will be important later.

Anyway, I had invited a girl I know to this party with the hopes of having a chance to score with her. As the night went on, we were flirting and things were getting heated. We make our way to my bedroom. That is when I fucked up. I had my remote in my back pocket so I could easily change the song or the volume and I had forgotten about it in my pocket. Before we had taken our clothes off, I was laying on my back while we were making out. What I didn't realize was that the position I was in was perfectly wrong and that the siri button was being held down the whole time. So as me and this girl are making out and talking dirty, the Apple TV was transcribing everything that was being said to my guests in the basement. It was only a couple minutes before the clothes came off and thus deactivated siri but the damage had already been done.

After the good times were over, we got dressed and went to re-join the party. As soon as we entered the room, everyone seemed to be acting weird and like they weren't telling me something. When I finally got them to tell us what happened, the girl was so embarrassed that she left and I have barely heard from her since.

tifu,"This happened just now, actually. I can't go back to sleep. 

I work for a company that requires travel some weeks. They rent a couple of houses in the city that we travel to for work. This week theres 8 people, including my coworker we'll call Liz and my boss we'll call G. 

We're all goofy people that really get along at this job, and it's not unusual for relationships to blossom. I myself met my SO at this job. Liz and G have been hitting it off and I thought nothing of it - what people do in their own time is their own. 

Apparently Liz and G hadn't figured out how to talk to each other outside of work yet, so weeks spent at this rental house have been a little awkward with the sexual tension. It all came to a head when G offered everyone some of his gin he brought with him. 

We're all watching movies and it's getting late, and they are getting more tipsy. We've got to get up early and work in the heat, so I say goodnight. I wonder to myself when the hell G and Liz are gonna make any moves on each other, then I fall asleep.

My bedroom is right next to the living room so I can hear pretty much everything, so I put headphones in to fall asleep. I wake up at about 1am, hoping that everyone has gone to sleep so I can take my headphones out. Instead, I hear heavy panting and moaning from the living room. G and Liz are definitely fucking. It's a full-on drunken romp from what I can hear. 

I don't know what the hell to do initially. I was a bit shocked at first, then simply pissed that I had to hear it. I waited a while to see if they would stop, but the moaning and male grunting just kept on. I didn't want to just bust into the living room and break it up, but I sure as hell wasn't going to let them keep me up all night. The bathroom is right across the hall from my door and not in view of the living room, so I decide to fake a midnight pee trip in the hopes that the noise would signal them that people can hear. 

So I'm sitting in the bathroom for about 3 minutes pretending to pee and wash my hands. They shush each other for a second and things quiet down until I get back into my room. I lay down for a bit thinking that they finally stopped, but they start back up again just as loud as before. I'm really dreading the thought of having to go in there and somehow ask them to stop so I can get some sleep. I really don't like knowing what sounds my boss G makes when he's fucking, I sure as hell don't need to *see* him fucking.

I sit there listening to this bullshit for a couple more minutes before I summon up a few ounces of bitchiness and open my door to go out. At first I just stood there outside my door and loudly coughed, hoping that would be enough. Nope - still grunting. There's a closet that extends the hallway so I inch along that to try and avoid seeing my coworkers in all their drunken sex crazed glory. I cough again, louder, to no avail. Finally I get fed up and say,

""Hello!? Seriously!?""

They go quiet, and I take the opportunity, ""It has to STOP.""

Then I retreated back to my bedroom. It's been quiet since then, and since I've been writing they seem to have cleaned themselves up. I have no idea how I'm gonna work with them in the morning, or ever again really. I can't sleep after all that either.

So TIFU by waking up in the middle of the night.

tifu,"Ok this one is crazy. This did not happen today but a couple weeks ago.

So I’m just chilling on the computer when I get a bit hungry. My lazy ass decided to just grab whatever was nearby, in this case a bowl of pistachios. I popped the first one into my mouth and noticed it tasted stale, but still good. So, like an idiot, I kept on eating those nuts, like 35 in total. After I depleted the bowl of its contents, I played some more of the game I was playing (SCP: Secret Laboratory) and then went to sleep at around 11:00.

Before we get to the consequences of my nut feast, have some Backstory. When I’m in extreme pain, I hallucinate weird shit. This only happened one other time; I got a stomach flu and it hurt so bad that I hallucinated that I was in a very dark and dense forest with only leave-less trees and pain. Now onto the story.

I then wake up at around 3:00 am feeling like SHIT. I can only feel pain and dread. The dread came from the fact that I was hallucinating [SCP-173](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-173) breaking containment. I can’t remember exactly what I was doing, but I do remember thinking “Fuck I can’t blink cause then it will snap-wait, I’m in my bed at home and I’m in pain”. So I’m just lying there, wondering how long I’ve been out of it when my ass decides to act up. Thankfully, I make it to the toilet in time to take my worst shit to date. It felt like the Gates of Hell opened up inside my anal cavity, while Satan himself was violating my ass with a Dewalt Power Drill. It hurt so bad that I was pain-hallucinating 173 *again*. You know you’re taking a bad shit when a concrete sculpture with Krylon spray paint is encompassing you’re field of view.

After blacking our for around 3 seconds, I just auto-piloted straight through the whole bathroom routine and back to bed where I slept with no pain. I don’t think I’ll be hitting the pistachios again for a while out of fear.

Wasnt today but about 18 months ago

I met a girl through an online dating app, found out that we both played the same game so got chatting and flirting very quickly, on the first meet up found out she was a squirter. Now this is the dream for most men no idea why, also now she liked to use toys while having sex all this will come more relevant later 

Second time we meet up I found out she likes to dress up, so me being the horny bastard I was agreed and she went to 'slip into something more comfortable'. She comes back down in a maid outfit and we get down to the deed, she proceeds to squirt everywhere, no issues leather sofa and laminate flooring.

She then decides she wants a toy so get off me and turns to go over to the other sofa, this is where she slips and proceeds to fall and knock herself out on the harth infront of the fire. Oh shit I start panicking having drank the best part of a bottle of vodka each, shes out cold wearing a maids outfit, I put her in the recover position call 999 and get an ambulance on the way.

She starts to throw up and I get some clothes on her before the paramedics arrive, she starts to come round just before they arrive, they come in and do all the checks and she is allright after about half an hour, however before this she is asking me have we had sex yet repeatedly infront of the paramedics

So I pulled down my swim trunks til my dick was out and planked against the tidepool so my ass was up in the air and my dick was in the anemone. It felt good when the sea anemone closed up on my dick but not after. It felt soo good when it closed up on my dick but unfortunately I put my dick in a poisonous one so it fucking stung me.

tifu,"This fuck up happened Yesterday afternoon but it started about 6 months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

On and off for for the last 8 months i would collect Monster energy drink cans, i don't know why but i ended up amassing about 20 cans. After a while i got sick of looking at them and was going to throw them away. however i couldn't be bothered so they stayed on my shelf collecting dust. 

&amp;#x200B;

One night when i was at the peak of my jerk off session, i went to grab a tissue... no tissues. So my horny mind started to think up of places i can quickly bust, so i can have some sleep. I'm looking around and i spot my can collection, i thought ""sure why not."" So i grab a can at random,  aim down the narrow hole, shoot and put the can back onto the shelf. After that night i completely forget about what i did.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a whole 6 months to yesterday. I managed to score some weed from a friend, I'm not a regular weed smoker so i had nothing to smoke it with. I start looking online on how to smoke without roll paper, and i come across a bong made of a can. So i promptly grab a can from my shelf, poked some small holes in it and off i go to the park. So i'm smoking away listening to podcasts/music high as a kite. As i use up the rest of my weed i crumple up the can and this liquid comes out. At first i though it was just some Monster left in the can, so i try and smell it because it has a nice sweet smell but i couldn't. So i shove my nose up to the can and get some on my finger to get a real good sniff. I then realised that i came into a can one night 6 months ago, i couldn't believe it.

As of right now i'm laughing at the whole situation, and still grossed out that i was inhaling weed through a can with 6 month old cum in it.

We were at an after party she was hosting. We went to a park and she hurt herself so I was messing around and picked her up because she was whining about walking around. She’s okay with me carrying her because we’ve been friends for around 4 years and she’s pretty comfortable around me.

Anyways I put my arm under her knee and another behind her back and picked her up.

Apparently I reached behind her back too much and reached around and grabbed her boob. I picked her up pretty fast so it all happened quickly. I stood there wondering why she was so squishy. I looked down to see my hand squeezing her side boob. I said oops and played it off but the awkward tension was already there. It wasn’t anything special but it certainly was both of us looking at each other and saying “Let’s shut up and not talk about it” . I took my hand off and kept carrying her and we went towards our distracted friends.

I feel bad because it felt like I violated her. Her mood didn’t change at all tho and she was glad I saved her the trouble of walking, but I still felt like a bad friend for touching her. Even if it was by accident.

tifu,"So this story happened about a week ago. I went to Magaluf on a ""lads holiday"" with some friends to celebrate finishing school. After one particularly fun night of binge drinking and using every drug I could lay my inexperience hands on, I decided to walk back to my apartment alone.

I take a dodgy side street and encounter a fairly good looking Senegalese prostitute offering to fuck me for free. I'm not a virgin and I'd been in Magaluf for three days with no luck so I was horny, drunk, drugged up, and stupid. Being in the state I was in, it sounded like a fantastic idea. She takes me around the side and sits down on me on the ground after putting a condom on my limp dick.

So about after 20 seconds after limp-dick-riding with 0 penetration, I feel her rummaging through my pockets. In my rage I spank her ass hard enough that she gets up. She gives my phone, money, and cigarettes back while I'm here screaming at her with my cock out, threatening to knock her out. A Senegalese prostitute trying to rob a young drunk lad - aye, what a fucking shocker. 

Next thing I know I'm being stared down by a 6' tall muscular African man. The pimp has arrived. The cocaine has kicked in fully. I'm screaming at this guy that I'm going to fuck him up, smash his teeth in, all the stupid shit. I'm telling this dude that I have connections in the IRA that would kill him (a common Irish defense mechanism for dodgy situations). That seems to make him back off and I dash back to the apartment to vomit.

Today was actually a pretty shitty day because of some personal problems and I was not thinking straight, but I still went out to buy something.

I went to a geek store in my city and bought her a cute personalized pillow, it has her favorite anime on it and I know she loves pillows and stuff like that.

Bought it, called my parents to pick me up because it was a little late, got on the car and went to text to a friend of mine about what I got for her while my dad was driving. She didn't seen to be offline, like always so I just send the message saying exactly what I got and why I thought my girl would like it. 

Arrived at home, my friend answered my messages, except it wasn't my friend, it was my girlfriend. I had actually texted her instead of the friend I wanted to! I don't know how I even managed to do that either, was my mind just set to automatic? She was confused but knew what I was talking about, while laughing hard as I tried to make a cover up story for it. I told her it was a gift I chose for a friend's birthday, which of course just had to have the same taste in anime and gift type. She said ""Ok"" but it's pretty obvious that it's for her, she's not dumb either. 

The worst part is that we'll see each other tomorrow morning and I don't even want to imagine how will I look at her in the eyes and try to pretend this didn't happen. I still can't belive how I fucked this up in such a dumb way.

Now after one very important game about 5 hours from where I live, I had my brother, mom and grandparents with me to watch the game. After the game has ended and we're in the car ride home I start to notice a crazy painful feeling near my appendix getting worse and worse quickly. Long story short I end up in the ER to look at my appendix as there worried it will burst.

After a while once the pain had gone down, two male doctors were sent it to check on me, apparently twisting a testicle can cause similar pain to the appendix bursting if left untreated. So with all my family in the room, two male doctors proceed to feel my balls for a good 45 seconds, towards the end of those 45 seconds to my surprise I begin to get an erection. I guess just the thought of me trying to not get one basically screwed me over. But now my whole family saw me get a boner from two male doctors touching my nuts.

So it was summertime and I was at a music festival and drank lots of beer, shots, you name it. I was wearing very short shorts and generally a somewhat slutty attire. I was just hanging around and having fun and got incredible drunk.

Sometime during the System of a Down concert I meet this guy, whom I had been hooking up with previously a few years back. We dissappear somewhere towards the end of the concert to hook up again in a boat house.

Fast forward to later that night, where we are both quite drunk and go to get something to eat. While still holding my food I suddenly have to fart, thinking that I can do it silently with all those people around. My body did not agree after the enormous alcohol intake and I end up shitting my pants - not just a little but a solid mass of shit that I can feel in my pants. I excuse myself from the guy and go to the potty nearby, seeing that I in fact have made an extensive shit in my pants. I end up throwing my panties in the trash can and wiping before going out again, now with only the very small shorts on my bottom half, very embarrassed.

The guy/crush didn't seem to have noticed though and the night continued unaffected by the incident. Until later when I get a few stares from people around us, and he mentions that my cheeks and part of my vagina is showing through the dissapearingly short legs of my shorts.

I work in a pharmacy at a hospital, and occasionally we need to deal with extremely hazardous medication. 

On that day, a Pharmacist  came by asking about [Bosentan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosentan), which is extremely hazardous to fetuses. She needed to do a consult and wanted to test how easily a tablet of the drug could be split.

Full disclosure, I thought she was pregnant. She had kind of grown over the course of a few  months, and kind of had that shape.

Me, being the idiot gentleman that I am, offered to split it for her. I'm a guy, so I'm immune to the worst effects of it. She said that it was fine. Just for good measure, I offered again: ""Are you sure? You know it's pretty dangerous if you're pregnant. I don't mind"", and automatically gestured to her stomach with my pinky. 

""I'm not pregnant!""

Oof

In an attempt to make a glorious save, I said ""I know that! But if there's any possibility that you may become pregnant...""

And she cut me off: ""There's no chance"". I thought that she was seeing someone, so again, being the idiot I am, decided to ask again just to make sure since I really didn't mind: ""I really don't mind. I wouldn't want you to be at risk"". ""I said there's no chance"" and grabbed the drug and pill splitter from me.

A few days later I was talking to another coworker that's in the know and told her what happened. It turns out the pharmacist was dumped awhile ago and was taking it really poorly and had gained a bunch of weight as a result.

tifu,"Last Halloween, one of my old coworkers brought a pumpkin in so we can do a carving get together with the team that never happened because our supervisor forgot the carving tools. By the time the pumpkin carving idea was brought up again, it was almost Thanksgiving so we all decided that either someone takes the pumpkin home or it’s going to stay in the office as an unofficial mascot. No one took it home and my coworker who bought it left the company. The pumpkin stayed on the office huddle tables and eventually migrated over to an empty desk in the cubicle next to me. Besides the tiny happy face someone drew on it and the slight poke near the top, there were no blemishes on it. We thought, ‘Hey, this pumpkin looks fine. When it spoils, we’ll know.’

Fast forward to last month and it was announced that we were hiring a new guy. The Friday before he was supposed to show up a few of my coworkers did a quick job of cleaning off the desk by placing things in random shelves. One of those things was the pumpkin. It went from sitting on the desktop to being placed in the overhanging shelf above the computer monitor. My next door cubiclemate and I debated on moving it but we said we’d surprise the new guy with it as a welcoming gift and if he wants to move it, up to him. His first day went along the lines of ‘Like your new desk? Check out all the shelves!’ ‘Why is there a pumpkin in here?’ ‘Surprise, it’s yours now! It’s been in our office since Halloween. No one wants it, so we just left it alone.’ ‘I’m surprised it looks ok stilll. I don’t want it so I’ll just leave it here.’

Now here is the fuck up. This morning, my new coworker asks me how to submit a work notification because he thinks the ceiling is leaking and there is a brownish puddle accumulating under his computer monitor. I can’t see anything on the ceiling and when I come over to check it out, I notice the liquid looks as if someone spilled coffee as a prank. It hits me that no one would do a stupid prank like that and there is only one explanation for the puddle. I tell him to open shelf and the lo and behold, the pumpkin has died. Our orange rotund mascot has imploded into an oozing pile of rotten mush. By opening the shelf, it’s released a potent musk. The smell is what my conspiring coworker describes as the typical smell of a pumpkin patch, but to the rest of the team, the noses were plugged and urges to gag ensued. We supposed that over the weekend, the pumpkin lost its will to live in its physical form and left foul smelling remainants in its wake. The keyboard rest that happened to be next to it soaked up so much of the rotten pumpkin juice the wood panel snapped once we picked it up. The three of us (me, the conspiring coworker, and the new guy) proceeded to clean up the mess, inadvertently flinging mush onto the carpet, notepads, and desktops. There looks to be a hard to remove stain on the metal overhang shelf and the smell of rotten pumpkin lingers in our area. We confessed to our supervisor and she laughed. 

**Tl;dr:** Pumpkin was brought in last Halloween for the purpose of carving. Pumpkin was basically forgotten about by all, placed in shelf of new guy as a “welcoming gift.” Pumpkin took a dramatic exit via implosion and our sleepy Monday morning selves had to clean up the aftermath.",TIFU when I forgot to check up on something from last Halloween
tifu,"Wow never done this before but here goes.

So today my girlfriend came over and one thing lead to another and we ended up screwing. It was amazing. Now I still live with my parents, I'm 22 and just back from uni. And my parents are heavily Catholic and don't believe in contraception. So the question became, what happens to the condom? I can't just put it in the bin or my dad would find it. I had to find a different solution. I decided to flush it down the toilet (sorry environment but I had to make a snap decision). My girlfriend went to the toilet pretty much as soon as we'd finished and so the main toilet was out of action. So I had to go and use the only other toilet available, my parents en-suite. I went in and chucked the condom down the toilet and left, thought no more about it. My girlfriend left a few hours later and everything was normal. Now here's where the fuck up happened. I thought I'd flushed the chain, but I hadn't. I had just left a used condom floating in my heavily catholic parents private toilet. About two minutes after my girlfriend left I heard a shriek from my mums room and I ran in to make sure everything was okay. It wasn't. She was just stood pointing at  the toilet screaming. She found my secret.

So I'm now in deep shit and my parents will be taking me to church tomorrow to get a lecture from the priest about why contraception is bad, and now everytime my girlfriend comes round I have to leave the door open. I'm 22 and I have to leave the sodding door open.

Throwaway and throwaway names.

OK, I'll call myself Angus.

OK I was mad busy and haven't relieved myself in a while. I was just about to do so and then my mom says 

""Hey Angus, clean your room, we're having guests over""

""Who coming over?""

""Your aunt and Uncle Shawagins, we haven't seen them in a while so we decided to invite them over."" 

I was like ""Ok"" but deep inside, I was super excited because they have a daughter my age will call Sharkesha who is absolutely beautiful. Id so ask her out if she wasn't my cousin. I was also pissed because I had to clean my room, but whatever. I try to clean my room fast, so I can relieve myself. I was inching so hard to jerk it. 

I clean my room fast and then about to go to the bathroom and then they come. So I go down to say hi, and then we sit in the living room with the TV on etc. I want to excuse myself to go back to the bathroom but people keep talking to me and here I am just staring at Sharkesha itching more to jerk it (not specifically to her but she is hot though.)

I finally get free of talking and I go to the bathroom. I go in and go to the pornhub app, put on some weird cosplay porn and start jerking. My gigantic Galaxy Note 9 is a tough one to hold in one hand, but I manage. So as I'm jerking, my phone slips and I accidentally click the cast button on pornhub which streams the video onto a nearby smart TV or Chrome Cast. I get so scared, I close out of the app thinking it would stop casting. ""feewww"" I get a text from my friend and I answer him back and after a minute or less, I go back to finish what I was doing, 

I open pornhub and it's STILL STREAMING! At that point, my mind is exploding ""oh shit!"" I don't finish and I walk downstairs acting like nothing happened. I get down and everyone is staring and my mom blurts out ""WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT!"" I try to act like I don't know anything. 

""I didn't do anything.""

""The TV said Angus's Galaxy is connected.""

""I don't know why?""

""You said you had to go to the bathroom and you had your phone with you.""

Im so nervous, sweating and Sharkesha's face the whole time is just in utter shock and I don't think I'll even be able to say to word to her or anyone ever again lol.

The whole rest of the night was so awkward.

tifu,"A couple of months ago, I discovered guacamole. I live in Texas and it's been around my whole life but I don't know, I didn't give it a chance or my tastes just changed. Anyway, I was at a family gathering and helped my wife cut up the avocados and make the guac and fell in love. This has happened to me a couple times before with food and it's just magical. I began making multiple batches a week experimenting with new recipes. Tonight, I decided that I wanted some guacamole with a little extra kick so I added Serrano peppers. The stuff was amazing and probably the best batch I've made to date.  


You might be asking yourself ""how is this a TIFU, it sounds like culinary genius?"" Well, the problem came an hour or so later when the wife and I decided to fool around. A ways in, it was time for her to get hers because that's how we roll. Little did I know (but found out after via Google) that the capcasin oil from the peppers stays on your hands for up to 12 hours even after multiple washings and you shouldn't touch anything ""sensitive"". So her lady parts are now on fire and I'm feeling pretty guilty but not so guilty that I can't share with you fine folks.  


On the bright side, we have some delicious spicy guacamole in the fridge for tomorrow.

I was currently working in an IT support company but the pays were minimum wage at best. So like any normal person I decided to look for a better paying job.

Bam, bunnings warhouse was hiring level 1 and level 2 technical engineers for their IT departments.I decided to apply and polished up my resume and sent it off.

One week later I get the phone call to come in for an interview.I wear my best suit, and polish up. Sitting in the lobby its not long before the interviewer rounds the corner wearing the signature red shirt of the bunnings franchise.The interview I felt went great, I answered all his questions, showed evidence of my qualifications and discussed salary and availability.Coming to a close, the interviewer thanked me for my time and offered their hand out for a shake.

I firmly grabbed their hand and shook it, our eyes locked as he said his parting words.The interviewer says ,"" well it was lovely to meet you today \*blank\* we will keep in touch.My brain said, Say. It was lovely to meet you too. My eyes still locked onto his.My mouth fumbled and what came out of my mouth was not that at all.....Instead I said.....

I love you too.

tifu,"Happened earlier today. Not that cringy now that I think about it, but felt so awkward at the time!  
please excuse my grammar, I'm horrible at this stuff.

The gf is away on holiday for a month. There is a cute barista near my work, we always seem to have such natural flowing conversations. She always makes fun/points out that I'm a shy guy. For some reason ever since she started, I kinda promised myself that I would prove I'm actually how studly and charming I am to her. Not like in a get in your pants way, just wanted to prove a point.  

She was looking particularly nice today, so today was definitely the day to let out some of my charm... the tip of the ice-burg if I may say. Keeping in mind I've had a little family trouble, dad just left my mom for another lady out of the blue, and my sister is going through a divorce.

The plan was to drop the old ""Is your dad a thief"" charmer on her. We made eye contact while she was making my coffee. I smiled at her, she smiled back at me...Shoot your shot my dude! I inhaled, winked at her ... and in that moment, in my ADHD+ anxiety ridden head, before I said anything I suddenly thought ""*crap, what if her dad actually has legal issues, what if she has daddy issues, has she even seen her dad?*"". I don't know why I thought that! it just happened so quick!

So instead of ""*is your dad a thief?*"", out came *""is... your relationship with your dad alright?""* 

She said ""yes"" but in a wtf type of way. I become visually awkward at this point. Luckily we're kinda of friendly so I break down into ""*Oh god, sorry that was supposed to be a pick up line, please hurry with my coffee!*"". She laughed continuously until I left...I don't even like coffee anymore anyways.

tifu,"My friend and I went to the bowling alley today, we have been going every few days because I am taking a bowling class online. We were pretty much joking around the whole time, but in the middle of the second game he asked me, ""Do you think I could get just as much power throwing the lightest ball and just throwing it with all my might?""

Then I jokingly said, ""yeah throw it like a softball""

He goes back to the ball room while I bowl a frame, and he comes back with at 6 pound ball. I start to say no, but he fucking does it for a frame and I said, ""Ok I'll try it for one frame""

I get the ball in my hand, and after bowling 16 pounds all night it felt like it was made of paper. I walk up to throw it and it flys over the divider into the gutter of the next lane. The sheer embarasement as my friend cackled in the background was so intense, but there was only one thing I could do. I just had to bowl. I bowled the rest of the game and did really well got like 4 strikes in a row, but I forced my friend to leave after that game. Will update if the bowling alley people see it and ban me for life or something.

tifu,"This didn't happen today, but it did happen ten years ago today to be exact. I've waited long to tell my story so now I'm celebrating this post like it's some kind of damn achievement. It's just gone midnight here in the UK and here's my tale of woe.

I had been booked in for my smear test and as any woman knows, it's polite and respectful to make sure you're presentable in ""that area"".
So as I'm getting ready to go to see the doctor, I do a last minute antiperspirant spray in that area. Don't know why, it's not in my usual routine. It was winter, a dark morning and I was kind of getting ready in some dodgy lighting, still tired. 

I get to the doctor and everything goes ok.  It was a male doctor but I wasn't too bothered as he's probably seen everything before. Well let me tell you, it all changed that day.

As I was getting myself dressed after my smear, he showed me out and thanked me for ""making an effort."" I felt a bit uncomfortable then and it even crossed my mind that he was a bit pervy.

I had no idea what he was talking about until I got home and realised whilst going for a wee, that it wasn't antiperspirent I has sprayed in the area, but glitter hair spray. 

Yes, mine was probably the shiniest lady parts my doctor had ever seen. 

Tl;dr: mistook glitter spray for deodorant and my male doctor complimented me at my smear test.

*Edit* I'm glad so many people had a laugh about this, there's far too much sadness in this world at the moment. It's been pointed out that this isn't OC and I can't say anything other than that this absolutely happened and apparently to other people too. Thank you for the gold, it's a lovely gesture but I think I'll pass it onto the people in this thread who have been a bit negative in the hope it'll brighten their day up a bit. 

Thanks for the inboxes too, smear tests are extremely important so please ladies, make sure you are attending them.

tifu,"So this happened while I was still in Culinary School. It's relatively low on the TIFU scale,but I thought it was funny regardless.  Throughout a couple of days my chef said some things that I took as Seinfeld references, so I jumped to the conclusion he was a big fan. Unfortunately that was not the case. Now there's one episode, where instead of saying ""Bless you"" when someone sneezed, they change it too "" You are soo good looking"". So here we are, the whole class standing by the front table with our Chef doing a demo for us. Halfway through he lets out a huge sneeze, and you guessed it, I chimed in with "" You are soo good looking"" As it turns out he did not watch Seinfeld at all, and proceeded to stop what he was doing, look at me and without missing a beat "" What the hell did you just say to me?"" as the whole class proceeded to have all eyes on me. All I was able to get out was ""no Seinfeld fans here I see"" and quietly sulked to the back of the class. Quite the embarrassing moment.  Luckily I had one friend who got the reference and we were able to laugh about it later.

TL : DR.  Made a somewhat inappropriate Seinfeld reference to my teacher who I thought would get it, proceeding to make things between us awkward for the rest of the term.",TIFU by thinking my Chef/Professor was a big Seinfeld fan and making things very awkward
tifu,"So a little background:

My boyfriend and I live most of the time together with the exception of me going home to my parents to drive to college and to study occasionally. 

My boyfriend and I are not dirty people AT ALL. But we are also not complete clean freaks. I clean the house about once a month since that is what my schedule allows. Awhile ago I saw ONE single cockroach in our bathroom and I had a panic attack and put out traps and washed everything with bleach. There was no signs of cockroaches being in the house and since we are currently in the middle of a home remodel, some walls are taken down so there was almost no hiding places for bugs. I assume it wandered into the house from the middle of the woods surrounding our home the night that I saw it. I had not seen a cockroach since or any signs of them.

Flash forward to 2 days ago when I was up around 11pm at my parents house cooking something to save for later. It had all the lights in the kitchen on and the backdoor which has a giant hole in the screen was open to the outside. I turned around and saw a small cockroach in the middle of the floor. However, it was not scared of me as I walked up and squashed it. I threw it in the garbage and told my mom later when she got up to let our dog outside (around 12am). 

She first said she was sure it was a beetle and I didn't know what I saw. Because I knew she might think that I took a picture of the dead bug before I threw it away. She thought it looked like a roach but it was my impression that she still wasn't convinced. The next morning when I got up I was interrogated with questions as to if I had ever seen a bug at my boyfriend's house. Wanting to be honest (and thinking it was not a big deal) I said I had seen one awhile ago. My mother went into a full on panic and told me nothing I bring to his house can ever come in our house again and that all of my stuff has to stay outside. Confused I asked why. She stated that I must have brought it in to her house somehow from my boyfriends house. I certainly would have noticed a cockroach or eggs in my stuff that I bring home, but I just let the conversation diffuse after that.

Later that day, I told her it could have come in from outside through the open door to try to ease her concern and she denied that cockroaches ever get into the house from outside and someone always has to bring them in. Feeling kind of insulted that she was blaming me for ONE SINGLE bug in our house, I decided it was time to leave to go to my boyfriend's. As I was leaving she was quickly putting sticky traps everywhere in the house stating that she wanted to see if there were any more bugs. (She, as well as I, scoured the house looking for any sign of bugs or potential entry points and there were neither of those present)

Now my mother is someone who has always asked me if I am bringing bed bugs into her home at random times (for seemingly no reason and no bed bugs), and I obviously say no as I am not a gross person. Their house is about the same level of clean as there is at my boyfriend's in which the house isn't cleaned every other day but it is visibly clean and things are usually put away and tidy. 

Later that day my phone buzzed while at my boyfriend's house and I saw that she bought a roach killing powder. I texted my father what was up with, ""mom buying roach powder,"" and he never responded. Today I called him and apparently they are both scared now that there is a major infestation in their home despite the fact that I have been transporting items between the two houses for years and my parents have never had any bugs in their home. I expressed that I was hurt that they would think I was the source of an outbreak of cockroaches and explained that I have traps out since I saw the one and I clean the house and never see any signs of bugs. Apparently nothing I say can ease their anxiety as my mother has now bought and used THREE different kinds of roach spray (and the powder) in a 2 day period and bought a multitude of traps to put around our home. My father said to me that, ""your mother was seriously threatening to burn down the house if we have cockroaches."" So now not only am I the source of the outbreak with no evidence, I am the reason my mother cannot sleep and fears we have a major infestation, and I can no longer go home (for now) or bring any of my belongings which are clearly NOT roach infested into the home. All of this because I said I saw one bug (that most likely wandered in through the open screen) into the kitchen. 

TL;DR: I told my mother I saw one single cockroach on the kitchen floor and she has now threatened to burn down the house, has blamed me for the ""outbreak"" (in which I may no longer bring any of my belongings into her home), and used over 4 roach killing products in a 2 day period despite there being no signs of any bugs anywhere.",TIFU by telling my mother I saw one single cockroach on the kitchen floor
tifu,"Just a little preface, when me and my sister were young we were both crazy wild kids. Always moving around, never sitting still. A nightmare for our parents. I had ADHD so none of that should be surprising, but I was never put on any type of medication. 

Every Easter we went to my grandmothers house for an egg hunt with our cousins. We spent the afternoon decorating and looking for eggs. My grandma was an old Italian lady who did things old school, and when we ate outside, she used large circular smooth rocks to hold the tablecloth down. Dumbass me pushes one off the table unaware my sister is under the table. Her head peaks out at the perfect time for a decently sized 2-3 pound hard rock to pound her in the head. The rock hit her head along with causing her head to hit the ground as well. There was an insane amount of bleeding and we had to rush her to a hospital.

Little backstory: I study at a highschool where there are 10 exams in math and physics (5-5). If you fail 2 or more exams you have to go to a 6th exam and if you pass it you get to stay in the school. If you fail the 6th exam you have to go to the 7th exam where students from other schools can also participate. If you fail that too, you're expelled.

My fuckup began when I failed the 3rd math exam. I wasn't the best and was below average in math, always passing by 1 or 2 points (15/25 was a pass). I got 14 in that exam and was really sad that I failed it and didn't tell my mother about it to avoid my moms wrath.

I passed the 4th exam, but once again barely. Just yesterday I had the 5th exam and this time I'm definitely sure I failed. So now I have to tell my mom that I've been lying to her all this time about passing my 3rd exam and have to face her justified anger at me.

this happened 15 years ago.

this make -shift bike park was behind a series of houses, there was like a huge drop from the houses to the place where someone made a few ramps and sketchy half pipes in the dirt

&amp;#x200B;

when i was 7 years old i found a group of kids my age when i was riding around my neighborhood on my sick walmart bike.

they were pretty chill and all of them had their own bike so i would normally cruise around with them, few days go by after meeting them and the oldest one of the group shows us this sick spot where someone had built this huge dirt ramp, i don't know how tall this ramp was but i was pretty average height for a 7 year old and it was up to my shoulders.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the other kids took the leap of faith on one of the other smaller ramps that were there and he went flying, lucky for him he landed it but fell soon after from all of the momentum, no one was going to go down the big one, it was like a 85 degree hill until you hit the ramp.

so the oldest looks to me and offers a bet my 7 year old self couldn't refuse... $2 if i hit the jump, no one from our little biker squad went off this ramp, and i would be the first and not only that but i would have $2 for a freezy after, i just had to take it...

&amp;#x200B;

i take the drop going full speed, i wanted to pull out but before i knew it i was mid air flying like f\^$\*ing superman, hands in front and all of that, i hit the ground hands first with a huge pain in both of them, i look at them and they looked messed up, in a panic i ran up the hill screaming, mind you this is like a 85 degree hill, once i reach the top there was a old lady with dark sun glasses, i was telling her i just broke my hands and if she could call a ambulance she said she couldn't because she was blind, luckily for me their was a family that rushed out and called one for me, my mother somehow got there before the ambulance and knew in my mind i was going to get a can of whoop ass.

i spent the next few months or weeks (can't really remember) at home with 2 broken arms, one of them had to be re-broken because it didn't set right which wasn't fun at all

&amp;#x200B;

at the end i didn't get $2, ended up with 2 broken arms and a minor brain injury and almost permanently crippling myself and or killing myself(if my hands didn't somehow swing in front of me and cushion the fall, all that force could of been applied to my neck/head)

I was listening to a podcast where someone was reading a story, just trying to wind down late-night and chill so I can get to bed. Unfortunately, in the middle of the story, a sound effect with a knock that sounds EXACTLY like my door's plays, at 3 fucking AM.

Around a year or so ago, something similar happened (though in real life, not in the video), where I was up around 3-4AM and someone slammed on my door hard several times. Note that this is in a rather nice neighborhood.

I proceed to freak the fuck out and start screaming for help, grab a knife, and run to where my roommates are sleeping, waking up everyone in the fucking house.

tifu,"Happened a few days ago.

Me (43) and the wife took one of my teenage daughters to a sports tryout in a larger city.  Tryouts were that morning, so afterwards, we stopped to grab some lunch before traveling back home. 

The restaurant is a very popular regional chain, and was still pretty busy even though we were coming in on the tail end of lunch time. I take meds to help control my bp, and one of them has a diuretic in it. I went to the bathroom before we left the tryouts, but had to go again really bad by the time we got to the restaurant.

We walk in and get seated pretty quick. As we get to the table, i let the wife know i gotta go and head that way. We have eaten here before (i work in this area too) so i knew where the bathrooms were. 

I'm heading down hall to the bathrooms and there is one at the end of the hall (women's) and one on the left (men's). Apparently i had to use the bathroom so bad that i neglected to pay close enough attention to where i was going and walked straight into the women's bathroom.

As i walk in, I immediately realize something isn't right.  I think to myself ""No urinals??? WTF! Whatevs, I gotta piss!"" and head to the middle stall. As i stand there taking a piss, i see a waste can in the corner and notice that there are feminine product wrappers in there.  That's when i realized i fucked up.

About the time i realize my fuck up, i hear the door swing open and a lady goes into the stall next to me. I'm in total panic mode at this point. I finish my piss, zip it up, and make a beeline for the door, thinking i might just make it out without being spotted since the lady in the next stall is still doing her business and nobody else has come in.

Well, as i hit the door, thinking i'm home free, i look up, and coming down the hall towards me, with a look of complete horror, is a mother and her 2 young daughters. I just keep walking, head down, and get to the table.

I sit down and my teenage daughter asks me if i'm OK, and tells me my face is really pale. Wife agrees, and starts asking if i feel OK.  I convince them i'm fine as the waitress walks up to take our order. When i look up to tell her my order, i notice in the party room next to the dining room we are in is a huge party of the cities finest men and women in blue finishing up and heading toward the entrance/exit.

My paranoia kicked in and all i could think about was the lady i passed in the hall seeing the cops and complaining to them about me being in the women's bathroom. 

Now, i live in the deep south. I'm sure you've all seen the memes about fathers beating the shit of out men who choose to use the women's restroom. That's when visions of tasers and hand cuffs ran through my mind. I started looking around for the lady to see if she had noticed the cops. Wife notices and tells me i'm acting weird and wants to know WTH is going on.

Cops leave. No tasers or hand cuffs. But i was completely embarrassed by the whole thing.

Told the wife and daughter what happened when we got to the car. They both laughed for like 5 minutes.

tifu,"This happened a few weeks back.
I work at a small production house, with a very loose work climate. We're about 10 people (8 male, 2 female) and whenever we're not working we do whatever, from listening to music, playing videogames, browsing reddit or watching movies. Our office space is also very much open, and with just a head turn we can clearly see whatever anyone else is doing.

So this one time I was left alone at work with one of the girls. She was at her desk, and I was at mine. I was rendering a video, and with some down time I was browsing Reddit for something to waste my time on. A documentary of women's bodies after pregnancy caught my eye, since we were just talking about pregnancy at work.

I started watching, and as usual, my hands rested at my gut. I got so lost in the documentary I didn't realize they drifted down to my crotch.

And then, out of nowhere, a close up 30 second shot of one big boob with one pink and hard nipple rests on the monitor.

""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?"" I head behind me. I jump in my chair and turn around.

""ARE YOU TOUCHING YOURSELF!?"" There she stands, red as a tomato, pissed as a bull, my female co-worker. I jump out of the chair and start explaining before she kicks me or slaps me.

When I finally get what was going on clear, she starts laughing and I know I'm safe. ""Were this any other work place, you'd be toast. I'm totally telling everyone else.""

Time to put the lid on, I press down on the lid but it won't fit. It's one of those crappy Walmart 20$ blenders.  I push harder and harder until *sloooop* the bottom flies out to the side and the blender slams onto its side.  Now the computer... was on my kitchen counter also... on its side... with the case folded open.   I had been replacing the thermal paste with Thermal Grizzly earlier in the day, but I'm rather ADHD and got sidetracked.

tifu,"TIFU by trying to reduce littering, almost drowning, flashing all of my friends, and littering.

So I recently read a similar tifu and it inspired me to share.
So this didn’t happen today it happened  several years ago. I went boating with 5 of my friends 3 male 2 female. During college we were a pretty tightknit group, we spent most weekends going to the same parties, movies, events ect. We were out on the lake tubing one day and a tradition while on the lake is that we always collect litter as we boat. Usually its fun and simple, if we saw a bottle or any other garbage floating we'd pull the boat around to grab it. Over time we started to do crazier ways to compete over the trash. No glory had been greater than when a friend of mine reached overboard when the boat went full speed and snagged a bottle that nobody else saw.

Onto the FU. While we were on our way back to the boat dock we spotted a piece of trash directly ahead. Like usual we all lined up and tried to snag it without slowing down the boat. We all failed. Perhaps its because I had to much to drink but I had an idea that I knew would get me into the records books and without really thinking it through I ran from the nose of the boat full speed jumped off the back of the boat and into the lake. All while yelling “Dibs"". Well when I hit the water it was like I skipped off it a couple time before sinking in. I had wiped out tubing before but a couple of factors I hadn’t considered were . We tube at a lower speed than the boats max and I wear a life jacket while tubing. 

I learned my lesson fast. Hitting the water knocked out my breath as I inadvertently had belly flopped into the lake. Bouncing across the water I remember being aware that upon hitting the water my  string bikini snapped off completely but as I  sunk in the water, it went up my nose and in my mouth that was not a priority. I emerged from the water barely able to tread water I was coughing so much. I was just trying to stay afloat till my friends came and rescued me. The boat pulled around and my friends hadn't realized how much that hurt. Instead I got quite a few cheers and a lot of laughs asking if I got it. I couldn't answer, I couldn't talk the breath had been knocked out of me the ladder is within reach and I use my remaining strength to hurl myself up it. I land belly down, but up on the floor of the ship.
At first my landing met as lot of cheers from and laughs from all my friends. I rolled over on my side and started coughing up water and a few of them got quieter and more concerned but like any group of drunk college students in this situation they weren't to concerned. As I coughed up water and began to feel better I became more and more aware that they were all looking at me in my unglamorous glory.

Instead of running for a towel (which nobody bothered to offer me) I decided to play it casual. I pulled myself to a sitting position still on the floor and awkwardly asked “could somebody grab that bottle I missed"" in the coolest way I could manage.

“Sure” my friend piloting the boat answered and pulled the boat around in search. He eventually found it. One of my guy friends said to me “I'll grab you a towel “and began for the front (we keep them all in a front compartment so they stay dry)He received  boos from my girlfriends who were laughing harder than I'd ever seen them. “you don't have too I'll grab it” I said thinking it'd be less weird for me to grab it myself. Standing up uncovered felt like putting everything on display. The only comment was made by one of my girlfriends telling me “nice ass"" but that was it at least. On the outside I was putting on a confident, face even if on the inside I was having a mini meltdown.

I finally put a towel on. Despite my attempts to the contrary it was still a super weird ride back to the dock. Everyone kept asking me if I was ok or if they could get me anything. Every guy offered me a shirt (lot of good it'd do me now) ect.

But the despite how much that was an FU nothing makes this more of one than what came next. The realization that I jumped in to reduce litter and left two new pieces of trash behind.

TLDR; I jumped off a boat to get a piece of litter and save the planet. While the original bottle was retrieved I left two pieces of trash behind. My bikini","TIFU by Gathering Litter, Jumping off a boat, Accidently flashing, &amp; Littering"

I just wanted to make some cowboy candy and now my nostrils and throat are flaming smoky cespools of what could have been sweet delicious jalapeno goodness. 

I tried to boil down some jalapenos, vinegar, and sugar to a nice tasty, sweet, spicy, tangy mixture.


The smoke has reached upstairs, my nose is running. I don't have much longer.....


I only left for a MINUTE....


A Reddit minute which we all know is at least fifteen fucking minutes. I started to get a whiff of something burning and ran down stairs. Holy fuck the air is SPICY. I grab the smoking pan of my beautiful Jalapenos and take them outside. 


I tried to stay downstairs long enough to open windows and doors and fan out some smoke. I inhaled so much capsaicin that my snot is probably 100000 scoville right now.

Also why is it that my smoke detector goes off with the tiniest bit of smoke when nothing is wrong but when I'm literally creating a house filled with tear gas IT HAS NOTHING TO SAY????? Thanks smoke detector, always knew I could count on you.

tifu,"As normal this happened about ten years ago.  I had just gotten out of the Navy and I landed a job at a government lab.  It was my first week there and I had to take the required pee test.  I headed on down to the medical facility, eager to empty the 20oz of water I just sucked down.  I waited in the reception area for my number to be called.  The lady came and took me back to the processing room.  There was a counter, a sink, a coat rack, and a lock box for your valuables.  There was a smaller “closet” where the actual toilet was.  The lady told me to roll up my sleeves and take everything out of my pockets. I obliged and listened to her speech about filling the bottle and putting the tamper seal on.  I saw a couple of other samples awaiting processing and she told me that is where I put the full sample.  She asked me if I had any questions and I was ready to go.

So at this point I have to provide some backstory for myself.  When I was in the Navy we were doing drug tests it seemed like every other week.  We had a couple of guys pop on my ship for several narcotics, so the captain was having us checked pretty regularly. On top of that he had made sure the people witnessing the transfer were aware that they had to visually see it happen or else you would be written up for an article 15.  On top of that, the guys that were doing the test heard some of the guys were using the whizzinator.  It’s a prosthetic used to hold clean urine.  So we had to stand feet shoulder width apart straddling a mirror so they could make sure our undercarriage was our own.  So after 2 or so years of this routine I kind of just got used to this.

So this is where the story picks back up.  As I’m standing there getting ready to do my thing the lady just stays there looking at me.  I misread the situation and think well maybe she has to witness the transfer.  So I drop my pants to the ground and let er rip. The lady jumps back like she just got uppercut by Tyson, and nearly knocks the other urine samples on her.  She covers her eyes and motions for me to go to the closet toilet.  So another coworker hears the commotion and opens the door to find me duck walking, with my pants still on the floor, to the closet while pinching my junk so no extra sample comes out.  She closes the door just as fast as she opened it and at this point I’m in view of rest of the waiting room.  So I finally make my way to the toilet I leave the door open thinking she needs to be in the room.  Nope, she slams the closet door on me,  so I finish taking a piss and walk out give her the bottle and wash my hands.  It is silent.  She’s reading a bandaid label trying at all costs to avoid eye contact.  She says thank you and I’ll know by the end of the week about the results.  I open the door and the 5 other people in the waiting room are reading or looking at the floor as I come out.  I just kind of walked back to my area wondering if I just sexually assault someone and if I would get fired.  I never heard anything and I didn’t tell anybody about it for years.  On the plus side, my job does random drug tests and people usually get called about every year and a half.  To date, that is still the only test I have taken.

tifu,"I work in a private nursery and our son(2M) comes into work with me some days that I'm in.

So in the class today my colleagues decide to do father's day cards, so I'm all excited because I'm a bit mushy about all of that stuff so I continually go over to spy to see what the design is.

So it's my son's turn and they call him over. I'm hiding behind one of the units to get a peek of what masterpiece he could be designing.

That's when I see it.

The giant fucking tub of glitter.

He literally takes the tub and tips it upside down and pours the whole entire contents of the thing ontop of the card! 

So my first emotion is panic. I know this is supposed to be a card for his dad on father's Day but unfortunately he HATES GLITTER WITH A PASSION. I made him a card with A LITTLE glitter on and it literally infected his office and he still brings it up when we have marital disagreements that I sabotaged his life with flecks of death. If I get it out in the house he gets all flappy armed and has to walk away or he ""can't cope"".

No way in hell was this card coming home with me.

So the thought of our son is coming home with every single piece of artwork covered in the material that would cause my husband's mental breakdown, I stepped out of my secret hideout and Said:

""Ohh noo, I'm so sorry, I forgot to tell you, his dad is allergic to glitter, he can't take that home with us"" 

I felt like I total boss, best lie ever!! He can play with glitter at nursery as long as it's washed off and no more panic attacks from sweet old daddy. Win win for both my boys. 

I go on with my day and then the end of the day is imminent. I decide to go over to the art rack to clean up all the paint and check out some of the cool artwork some of the kids had been doing today. That's when I see it. This massive box on the shelf with my son's name on and inside perfectly in the middle of the box is his card to his dad. HIS ARTWORK IS LITERALLY QUARANTINED.

This is the moment I realised that I fucked up.

All of the other kids work was sitting cutely in a box together, card friends and having a great time. My child now has a segregated box and sits three shelves away alone but completely safe from the horror that is glitter.


P.s I don't want to discredit real allergies I know they can be pretty scary, I just panicked and it's the first thing that came out of my mouth.

TL;DR:

tifu,"This happened about a month ago. Every second weekend of the month, we(me and my friends) go to my family farmhouse. So we have a ritual of stopping over at a McDonalds on the way, have something to eat and then take coffee for the road. At times we take the food in the car and eat it on the way. It is understandable that some of the food might fall inside the car while it is moving. The logical thing would be to clean the car regularly. But I have a habit to procrastinate and get it cleaned once every three months.   
This time I was a little more lazy than usual and hadn't cleaned my car for atleast 5 months. Such highly favourable condition made it possible for an intrusion of cockroaches to thrive within my car. My friends kept telling me there are small cockroaches in the car, but I barely saw a few, so I thought it's fine. The next wash was anyways due   
The latest escapade planned was going as smoothly as possible. It was so perfect that I thought I should treat my self with a chocolate muffin. I have a habit of dipping the muffin in the coffee and eating it and generally some crumbs / chocochips drown in the coffee which I relish having in the end.   
So with half a glass coffee left, we hit the road. Just like the day, the drive was really pleasant and I kept driving, forgetting about the coffee.   
We reached a toll plaza on the way, where in search of some change I saw the coffee and took a quick sip out of it. I felt a solid piece with the sip which for some reason I just gulped it down(because the toll executive was staring down at me waiting for the money).  
When we crossed the toll, I was craving for another piece of muffin crumb/chocochip, since I just swallowed one without tasting it. And there was not much coffee left either, a mouthful at max. So I just emptied the entire cup in my mouth and I felt a couple of chunky pieces of chocochip which I instantly bit into. I instantly got a sour and salty taste, which slowly overpowered the coffee as I kept chewing. In a while I could feel small hair like material and instantly got disgusted(assuming it belonged to one of the employees). So I balanced it on the tip of my tongue inside my mouth and stuck it out, carefully sticking it on the tip of my index finger to see what it is. It definitely looked like a limb of an arthropod. And at that moment, realisation struck and I spat out the contents of my mouth out of the window.

The residual roach limbs were still in my mouth and I emptied my entire saliva glands in the first few spits. Now I could feel them even more closely and intimately in my mouth. At this moment I pulled over and rinsed the insides of my mouth thoroughly with water.  This was the moment I realised I need to wash my car and planned on doing it the first thing after the trip.   
Although the experience was really traumatic for me, my friends were really having blast. And once it was over, I saw the joke in it and laughed it off.

tifu,"So as usually this didn’t actually happen today, but 3 weeks ago, just before we went on holiday. 

So me and my girlfriend like to travel, the only problem been is that I hate long haul flights. It’s not the flying so much, more the 8+ hour trapping in a seat. So we were flying from London Gatwick to LAX, a 12 hour flight. Lovely. 
We get to the airport check in and whatnot, whilst having a nosey around the airport we were browsing the Boots, where I saw sleeping pills, after buying the pills we headed the bar and had a few pints, cause it is a holiday so drinking at 10am is acceptable, One hour or so before flight I took two tablets like the box suggested.
About an hour into the flight I start to feel a bit drowsy, sound tablets must be kicking in, but then drowsy turns into dizzy and dizzy turns into me feeling v drunk. Not to worry I’ll get some sleep. 
Wake up 5 hours later feeling lovely and refreshed half way through the flight, although when I awoke my girlfriend wasn’t there anymore and I had a lovely bit of drool down my top.
So apparently if you mix sleeping pills and alcohol it’s creates some type of drunken drowsy trip and I had been sleep talking nonsense to my self! And accordingly my girlfriend not quietly. She’d gotten up and moved out of embarrassment and didn’t sit with me for the rest of the flight. 
Apparently during my power nap the air hostess came up to my girlfriend and asked if I needed any medical assistance as they couldn’t wake me up, but luckily my loving girlfriend told them to just leave me and ignore me because I’m an “idiot and brought it upon my self”.

tifu,"Like all good TIFUs, this didn’t happen yesterday.

My wife and I went to one of our favorite restaurants in town a couple weeks ago.  It’s just a bar and grill on the lake shore where you can sit outside right next to the water.  Whenever the weather is nice, we love sitting out there and enjoying a couple beers with dinner.

One of our favorite parts about sitting out there is the wildlife.  From our spot, you can look into the water and see fish swimming around and ducks love hanging out there.  I assume people toss fries or whatever for the ducks, so they made this area an official hangout.

On this particular evening, my wife and I were the only ones eating outside and we saw a pair of ducks (a drake and a hen) swimming offshore.  I thought it would be fun to pull up YouTube and make duck noises.  I found a video that had a couple different duck calls, so I started playing it.  Lo and behold, the ducks responded.  At first they started by making the call back to me, but gradually, they moved closer and closer.  They ended up on-shore and only a few feet away.  It was a pretty fun experience.  That is, until it got out of hand.

Apparently my phone was loud enough for other ducks to hear, because another drake swooped in.  This other drake had no interest in me, however.  He immediately went for the hen.  This led to a fight between the two drakes.  They started yelling (quacking) at each other and eventually flew off and chased each other around the lake with the hen following them.  Unfortunately, the original drake did not win the mating fight and the new drake flew off with the hen.

My wife and I stared at each other in disbelief as this whole thing played out.  She still jokingly calls me a home-wrecker, and I suppose that’s fair.

I’m not really super torn up about it.  In fact, I find the whole situation kind of amusing.  I thought this more light-hearted TIFU belonged here.

tifu,"This happened about a decade ago, and I'm finally comfortable sharing this anonymously to the public.

TL;DR I was tasked with researching a subject for my government job, and asked some questions online that led to me being investigated and eventually interrogated as a potential terrorist by the FBI and NCIS.

After I graduated from college, I used to work for the Navy as an engineer and direct federal employee. During my time there I mostly worked on small budget experimental and prototype projects. At one point, our team discussed placing our prototype on an RC airplane for testing purposes because they were a low cost alternative to our other testing methods. You know, try to save the government money. No one on my team had much experience with RC planes, but I had a little experience with multirotors from a college senior project. I gladly volunteered to research the subject as it sounded interesting.

Initially, I used google to find some RC planes what would meet our requirements. Unfortunately, most RC planes at the time were sold as a frame, and required you to choose an engine, propeller, batteries and other components that affect the capabilities of the airplane. The best place to find information about these planes was on online forums. Each model of airplane often had its own thread with hobbyist discussing the various configurations and performance characteristics of the plane.  

I found a particular RC airplane that I thought would meet my team's needs. I hopped on the forum and innocently asked how much weight the plane could carrying and how fast it could go. At first, I received some genuine responses until someone said, ""Wait a minute, why are you asking?!""  I panicked. I baked up some excuse of why I couldn't respond because I was under an NDA (technically true). Several forum members accused me of ruining the hobby and the thread devolved into personal attacks. I privately messaged two of the most vocal users who were certain I was a terrorist to let them know I worked for the Navy, and wasn't a terrorist. One user believed me; one called me a liar. I ultimately decided it was time to cut my losses and deleted my account from the forum. We ended up not using RC planes at the time and I thought that was that. I put it out of my mind.

About 4 months later, I received a call at 4:30pm from someone I will refer to as Special Agent Smith with NCIS. On the phone, Special Agent Smith asked if I could come visit him at his office right then. My job, at the time, was legally required to be a 9-5. My pregnant wife was expecting me home at about 5:15pm. So I asked Special Agent Smith how long it would be and what the nature of the visit was. He responded with, ""Only about half an hour"" and ""I'll tell you when you get here.""

I sent my wife a quick text that I'd be a little late getting home, and headed over to the NCIS office. I left my cell phone at the front desk and joined Special Agent Smith at his desk where he started taking notes on his laptop. The conversation was very casual at first, with the agent making remarks like, ""Just have to get some information down. I'm sure you type much faster than me,"" as clicked away at his keyboard filling in a bunch of information into some form.

The questions started simple, like, ""What are your hobbies?"" and ""How are you liking your job?"" The conversation continued casually with general get to know you questions for the next half an hour to hour.  I remember the exact moment when the interview changed to an interrogation. After a short pause, Special Agent Smith changed his tone and asked me why I hadn't mentioned RC planes as a hobby and simultaneously showed me a picture of me with my senior project team that had been pulled off of some archived university server. I was also shown printed out conversations from the RC forum where the conversations had occurred about the RC airplanes. The questions quickly changed to, ""How do I feel about the president?"" ""How do I feel about the war?"" The tone was no longer casual, and the questions became very pointed.

The pointed questions continued for another 30 minutes. Special Agent Smith encouraged me to be completely honest because it would be better for me if I just told him everything. After the questioning was complete, and just as fast as the interrogation had become aggressive, Special Agent Smith relaxed and told me, ""I already talked to your bosses, so I knew you weren't a terrorist. But, I had to go through the process anyway."" I was also informed that from the original forum post about the airplane, someone had reported my username as a potential terrorist to the FBI. The FBI had tracked me down and discovered that I worked for the Navy and then turned the investigation over to NCIS.

During the interrogation, I admitted to DMing two strangers and telling them I worked for the Navy. Because I had done this, Special Agent Smith told me that they would have to review my security clearance. At that particular location at the time, about the only way to get fired was to lose your security clearance. My wife and I had just discovered we were pregnant with our second child. Our first child left my wife extremely ill, and we had initially suspected she was pregnant because she was beginning to get sick again. Special Agent Smith told me that if I wasn't going to lose my security clearance, I wouldn't hear from him again. However, if there were any issues with my clearance, I would hear about it in 3-4 months and could address it then. Special Agent Smith also instructed me to keep quiet about the incident and questioning and sent me on my way.

By the time I left the NCIS office, my wife was panicking. I had disappeared off the face of the planet for a couple of hours and was not answering my cell phone. I returned home, and broke down in tears while I tried to explain to my poor, panicked wife what had happened.

My wife and I anxiously waited for news about my clearance, trying not to tell anybody about what was happening out of fear of facing some sort of additional punishment. My wife's health continued to deteriorate with the pregnancy that almost ended her life. Even after 4 months had passed, we still felt it hovering over us for quite some time.

Through all of this, my bosses found the incident quite humorous. One of them laughingly told a group shortly after the questioning, ""They asked me if I would be surprised if nothintooseahear flew a plane into a building tomorrow? I told them nothintooseahear was as American as apple pie!"" While he told the group of his experience, I just cringed, fearing retribution from NCIS and feeling extremely embarrassed for fucking up in the first place. After a couple of years, my wife and I saw the humor in the situation and have been able to laugh about the experience since.

Consequently, I did not get said things done so que me at 5 AM this morning, half drunkenly and very hastily throwing a ton of shit in my bathroom I didn't want my movers seeing and/or taking.

So homeboy goes into the bathroom to dump the water from the iron. He obviously can't because it's, like I said, packed full of stufd. Like wall to wall.

One day Im browsing gamestop for some new games, and the nice young man at the store offered to help me find a good one in the preowned section. After a couple questions about the type of game I like and what else I have, he selects this game for me. ""Divitity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition"" is printed loud and clear on the front. Looks neat. He says its like Dragon Age in playstyle, which I actually really dig, so I tell him I'll take it. Get the game home, load it up and start playing.



Now, Im a bit befuddled sometimes, and often forget names of games right after I buy them. So when my sibling comes in and asks what Im playing, I respond with ""uuuuuuuh...."" And I read the words that have just appeared on the title menu.



""Divinity Original Sin II""



Now, like I said, I forget all the time what the name of the games I get are, and it was a pre owned game, so I figure the guy wouldnt recommend me a game I couldnt enjoy without playing the first game to. And obviously the game would have the correct name on it, so I didnt look at the case. And I go about my day, enjoying the crap outta this game. Its so good that I contemplate driving back to the store to personally thank him, but it was a store thats like an hour away so I was like ""nah,"" and filled out that survey thing instead.



I played that game for like 2 weeks straight, taking it in and out of that case, but never actually reading the case.

I have an en-suite and usually when using it in the night I use a small light on the mirror in the ensuite, instead of the full light which will wake me up more and disturb my husband who is sleeping.

Around 2am I woke up needing the bathroom, in a dazed state I went in, closed the door and did my business. It must have been light enough from the moon to not need any extra light.

This is the FU. I am very pale with long dark hair, parted in the middle, and was wearing a skin coloured minimal nightdress.

I washed my hands, then looked up. The vision that greeted me was every stereotypical worst-nightmare ghost-woman image you can imagine and silently broke into a full body shock wave.

In better light it would not have been quite so contrasting with my skin and hair, bit instead I looked like a black and white horror film. 

I also have a secret fear of supernatural images appearing in mirrors (too many age-inappropriate films as a child maybe)

The next day, I went to school and normally texted a few of my friends, including an online friend that my mom didn’t know of, and she really doesn’t approve of me talking to basically « strangers » of the interweb. What I didn’t know was that my mom was receiving every. single. message. on her phone. And thinking the messages were for her after the notification, also reading a bunch of them. When I got home, she asked me who « name of the online friend was » and I knew this was the end of me. I tried to explain to her that I met him on a website and he was nice and blah blah blah, but it was extremely awkward as I basically hid something from her for a pretty long time, while I usually tell her things like that and we’re pretty close. Long story short, she was very angry and seriously lectured me about my poor choices, as well as asking me every question imaginable about the guy. However, on the positive side, she actually made me realize, when I reread some of our exchanges, a lot of a red flags about the online guy (that I was too dumb to see I guess 🙄) and I ended up stopping talking to him. He was pretty toxic, in the end so it really saved me from a lot of future problems. So it’s kind of a happy ending!

Tl;dr: Went on messenger on my mom’s phone, forgot to log out, so she received all of my messages with an online friend that she didn’t know of and didn’t approve of. Was pretty damn damn pissed at me but made me realize the guy was kinda of an asshole so we stopped talking.",TIFU by borrowing my mom’s phone
tifu,"So, I have a group chat with three of my friends. Another person used to be in the chat, but he got a new phone number. We never deleted his old number from the chat, and always wondered if someone else had gotten it and was silently lurking. 

They were, as it turns out. I’m not sure how long they were a fly on the wall, but yesterday they finally made themselves known, because I sent the following copypasta:

tifu,"Starting in 2018 I was amazing friends with a girl, we will call her Jenny. We attended class together and became best friends in no time and it went all the way till just about a few days ago. I have really bad anxiety, and during that whole time she assured me that I could talk to her about my anxiety at any time I needed and that it was okay, and so I did. If I had a question regarding our friendship, I would ask her. If I felt she was acting strange, I would ask her. Sometimes I would get periods where im really unsure and anxious about things and ask her things multiple times a day, while I also had times of not talking to her about anxiety for a month or two straight. We also texted basically every single day, and it was mutual because if I didnt text her she would text me, and vice versa. 

I never considered it an issue because she seemed always happy to answer my questions and was always there for me no matter what. We always joked around and never had an argument, ever. Like the thought of us not being friends just was unimaginable. 

However last Monday she was acting a bit weird after the night before of me having some anxiety, and I ask my question of ""are you okay? Did you get annoyed from my anxiety or something?"" and she answered she got a bit annoyed, which was huge to me because I wasn't used to that. I made the decision to not talk to her about it anymore. That whole day during school and at home she was acting strange (being quiet, saying very few words) and we played games that night and she could probably tell I was having anxiety while playing, but I never said anything about it. I informed her if she was annoyed with me in anyway just tell me so I wouldn't have to question her, and she said okay.

Then came Tuesday and I couldn't help but question why she was still acting so strange, so I asked her. I asked her ""are you annoyed about my anxiety last night"" and she says she is a little bit but then after school it got worse. She completely ignored me that night and so I thought she might've been bugged about something else, since my anxiety never seemed to annoy her before until now and so I suggested that if she needed someone to talk to about something she can talk to me, and she said she didn't want to talk about it so I just left her alone. 

Then came Wednesday and she ignored me the entire day, which started getting really concerning, but I decided to let her be. 

Thursday came and while at school in the morning I asked her about it and she said that she would explain later why she is ignoring me. She explains later saying ""I want to stop talking for a little while. Ive been so annoyed lately and I just need a break. Hope you understand"" and I was relieved to see that in a way because I thought she might've not wanted to be friends at all anymore. 

Nothing happens until today where I receive a message from one of her friends telling me that I need help for my anxiety, and that is why she wanted the break. I decided to try to talk to Jenny and she said ""No."" and when I just said that I wanted to apologize, she blocked me. After talking to her friend for a bit she said that Jenny did not want to be friends anymore, and when I asked why it was solely because ""anxiety and overthinking"" which really sucked, but I cannot blame her. I without realization put so much of my anxiety on her and I feel like shit for it. My dumbass went to try apologizing to her on Instagram too about it and got insta-blocked. Maybe someday we will be friends again, and I will have the chance to avoid talking about anxiety related things. Either way I fucked up and severely regret it.

TL;DR: I put my anxiety-related thoughts on my Ex Best Friend for over a year and now we are not friends.",TIFU by putting my anxiety on someone.
tifu,"Okay so this is gonna be an awkward and maybe kind of long one.

To get all the obligatory stuff out of the way: English isn't my first language, this didn't happen today but a few weeks ago, this is not my main account and I'm on mobile.

Let's get started with some background. I had my first gf when I was 16. She lived with her mom, who was very young to have a daughter that age and was kind of hot. My ex GFs father is a bit of a dick so he wasn't in her life much and her mum didn't have a bf at that time (doesn't now either, not sure how that factors into the story). 
In my family we didn't talk about sex and stuff, so pretty much everything I knew came from the Internet. My then gf and her mother were very different in that regard. They didn't lock the door when taking a bath/shower, talked openly about sex etc. At first it was strange for me, but in hindsight it helped me to be more open about this kind of stuff.
Back then we were both young and horny and did the deed all over the house, which led to us being ""caught"" by her mom twice. But that's not the TIFU. Now ever since then I have discovered I have a thing for older women, especially after I walked in on her in the shower and saw all the goods. 

Fast forward to about 10 years later. Me and my then gf hooked up a few times over the years, I saw her mom from time to time (we live not that far apart), nothing spectacular. I moved away for four years to study, but moved back recently. This is important because her mom works for the local general practitioner (now sure if that's the correct translation, a doctor you visit for minor stuff). I usually go to another gp, but he's in the village I live now and I had a rather unpleasant cut up my tigh that needed to be taken care after I got released from the hospital. 

I made my appointment, so he could check the stitches and stuff and of course he didn't do it himself but let my ef gfs mom handle it. At first it wasn't awkward or anything. I got a bit turned on by her touching me (yes, I'm that kind of person), but I had it under control. I went there four times. The third time I got a bit carried away and got a half hard on. I'm a grower, not a shower, so of course she noticed (I do of course wear boxers) Told me not to worry, stuff like that happens. The last session approaches and of course I get a full on boner while she covers my stitches with ointment. At this point she ""accidentally"" rubs my dick multiple times with her forearm. She know exactly how far she could teasing me, because even though I didn't shoot my load, it was very close. She just looked at me sheepishly and told me to have fun at home. 

As soon as I left she must have texted her daughter, because I wasn't even home when I got a text from her. Something along the lines of ""did you have fun with my mom?"" and a bunch of inappropriate smilies.

It's important to add that I don't feel violated or anything. I know this is important in this day and age, but I take this as some good old teasing. I'm certain she doesn't do that to everyone.

tifu,"Hey all, this is my first post on reddit so forgive me for not knowing how all this works. So I'm currently in a very rough patch with my fiance because of my stupid behaviour. So a little background on my fiance; she is a very sweet and non-confrontational person, and has anxiety problems (important to how I f***ed up) that gets triggered by instability and confrontation. I, myself, am a very outgoing and assertive person, and enjoy many (what people call them) dangerous hobbies including mma. I also have a very aggressive way of talking. My fiance has been trying to get me to cool off and not be so aggressive, but (even though I'm seriously trying) I've haven't stopped since she started bringing the issue up. So now that you guys have some context, let's dive into the shit show that is my love life.

Event 1: the initial trigger
A few weeks ago, I was driving home while on the phone with my fiance, when someone was tailgating me. And jokingly asked her if I should slam on the breaks, and after she asked me why, I explained ""this guy is tailgating me, I don't know why this f****er is in such a hurry"". She immediately hung up the phone and when I called her back to ask what happened, she told me she could no longer tolerate my swearing. I immediately became defensive and we started arguing right then and there. Eventually, we resolved the issue and continued as usual.

Event 2: the mma fighting trigger
As stated earlier, I'm an avid mma enthusiast, and do have hopes of competing one day. One day, I received a present from my fiance's parents, and I called them to thank them. Her mom asked me what I do during my time off school, and I explained I'm super busy, I'm either working, at the gym, or at the religious temple. She, an avid gym goer herself, told me ""I never knew you went to the gym"", and I replied ""it's not a regular gym, I got to an mma gym. She didn't know what mma was so I told her it's mixed martial arts. She also doesn't know what mixed martial arts are, so I just said it's cage fighting. She was surprised but nothing major and we ended our call with our normal goodbyes.

The next day while on the phone with my fiance, she asked me how serious I was about mma. And I asked her to clarify. She asked me whether I wanted to fight as a career. I said yes, because in my mind, a fight career is just a record. You could only fight amateur your entire life, and still have an mma career. But I guess in her mind, she thought I wanted to fight as a profession. Long story short, she wasn't cool with that, and me being my confrontational self, became super defensive instead of tackling her legitimate concerns. I became stubborn and stuck with the idea of fighting because that's what happens when I get frustrated... I become stubborn. Regardless, she accepted the mma fighting on the condition that I quit upon any injury and I will not give up my profession as an accountant to fight mma. 

Event 3: the final recipe
My fiance and I have talked about how we would like to raise our future kids, and one thing we could never get on the same page with was physical activity. I have aspirations of having a wrestling family (I'm a wrestler myself) and wanted to enroll my kids into wrestling from a young age. It's just something that I feel would be nice, but it's not a must that my kids have to wrestle. However, me being stupid, I became confrontational and stubborn in our next conversation. A few days after the mma argument, my fiance and I are talking, and she asks me whether I was serious about making our kids wrestle. I said yes. She could not accept that as an answer, and started stating her very legitimate concerns. I then, as usual, began getting defensive and stubborn and bolted down on the idea of having wrestling kids. I even told her ""I will not budge"" which is a lie, because this isn't that big of a deal to me. But now, she's super upset, and this was not resolved, as she said ""I'll have to think about it"".

Event 4: the final catalyst 
So just some background info, when I don't have anything to say to my fiance while we're talking, I'll just give her compliments or make cute comments. This time, the comments did not work. Already frustrated from our last three fights, my fiance says ""can you just have a conversation with me? I want to talk with you"". I said ok, what would you like to talk about? She said it's I don't know, tell me something. I remembered that earlier during the day, I was shitposting (shitcommenting?) On somebody's political Facebook post. The comment section became very heated and I said A LOT of things that I shouldn't have. Needless to say, during the time of the conversation with my fiance, I thought it would be a good conversation starter. I sent her the Facebook post, and things... things got a little out of hand. I actually gave my fiance bad anxiety because of the things I said, so much so that she told me she's scared of me. I sent her over the edge (her words).

Present day:
Event 4 happened on 5 days ago. My fiance is reconsidering the relationship because we're ""too different"", and every attempt to make things better since then has ended in failure because the second she begins to turn around, I start to ruin it by (you guess it) being defensive and confrontational. Because of said failures, we're taking a break from talking while she decides whether or not she wants to stay with me. I talked to a few trusted people, and after careful analysis (they grilled me on being retarded) and much contemplation, I have realized this situation could have entirely been avoided and fixed had I just stopped being so stubborn and confrontational. I am completely in the wrong by failing to understand her perspective. However, knowing this now isn't being any help, and that's why I'm turning to you reddit users. I cannot let my fiance go, she is literally the best thing to ever happen in my life. She is the BEST person for me, period. She's been so good to me, and I let her down like her feelings meant nothing. I would seriously never forgive myself if she ever left, and I wouldn't blame her if she does. She said she needs some space right now, and I'm just giving her that. But there has to be more I could do!! There has to be a way to win back the woman of my dreams. What should I do?

Tl;dr: I kept arguing with my fiance to the point where I pushed her over the edge. I'm now trying to win her back because I'm a f**kup...","TIFU mma, stubbornness and sh*t-talking ruined my relationship with my fiance"
tifu,"This happened yesterday afternoon but the scene itself I think will be forever etched into my memory.  


I am currently studying abroad in a foreign country and living with a lovely host family. My host mother's brother alternates between living with us at our house and at my mother's sister's house. He is an older guy and disabled, he can't really get around by himself and either needs someone to push him around in his wheelchair or can walk (very slowly) by leaning against the wall. He overall is just a very small but solid looking dude. Just trying to make the set up for this situation as vivid as I can for you.  


Yesterday while walking out the house, my uncle was in the process of being brought outside by the nanny who helps him get around. To get outside he has to be wheeled down a two step stoop that leads to the patio. This is a process I have never actually seen done to completion. The nanny walks away for a moment and my uncle gestures for me to bring him down to the patio. The combination of me not speaking the language perfectly and his limited speech capabilities made it so he couldn't really tell me how to do it. I am wearing my back pack and have my coffee thermos tucked under my arm. I am standing behind his chair looking down over the two steps and wondering how to navigate this. I consider turning him around and wheeling him backwards but decide that's too difficult.   


I end up going with the classic facing forward roll off. I take some tentative attempts at rolling him off but each of them seems to be too sketchy to commit to. Finally I decide I'll just tip the chair back and roll down the two steps slowly on the wheels of the chair. I tip him back and commit, but suddenly realize that leverage is not on my side. The chair starts tipping forward and I have no way to stop the inevitable. The flood gates have opened. I watch in slow motion as he starts to slip off the front of the seat. In a panic I reach out and grab his arm, trying to hold the wheel chair up at the same time. But my effort is not enough and he falls out of the chair completely and ends up on the ground. I am of course instantly concerned that he is hurt and am asking him over and over again if he is ok, and in this mindset I decide I need to get him up. I reach down, and never having picked up an adult before in this setting, go for an under the arm pits pick up.  I pick him up quickly in this far from graceful manner and put him back in his chair, now both of us at patio level. I made sure he was ok and he was telling me he was fine but I just feel like I absolutely fucked up that entire process. Why I didn't just wait for his nanny to come back is absolutely beyond me.

Am currently trying to go about my everyday routine while the weight of mi delito is on my back. wea

tifu,"So this happened about 3 years ago... I was on my way to the gym when I had a very strong urge to go to the bathroom but I decided to ignore it as I was late to the gym and I've done the same thing many times beforehand..

So I get to the gym and reach the final workout which was dead lifts and I like to go pretty heavy which makes me clench every part of my body while lifting..... I went home afterwards and everything seemed OK

The next day I woke up to an extremely swollen left testicle and a swollen penis. ....I told my dad about it and he took me to the hospital where I was told by a bunch of extremely incompetent doctors that I was fine and only needed medication....

2 weeks pass and I'm only getting worse when I go to another hospital and the Dr tells me that if I had gone to him in the first 24 hours he would've saved the testicle and that it was too late and it had to be removed so it would affect the remaining one

TL;DR. I deadlifted at the gym while wanting to urinate which caused me to have testicular torsion and get it removed due to some dumb doctors who said I was OK when in reality I COULD HAVE KEPT MY TESTICLE IF I WENT TO SURGERY IN THE FIRST 24 HOURS",TIFU - I lost a testicle cause I was too lazy to go to the toilet
tifu,"So, this actually happened today. 

A little backstory: We frequent our local Chuck E. Cheese ever since I figured out a way to get tokens/points at roughly 1/3 of the typical Charles Edward Cheddar rate of exchange. Makes it easy to justify going more often. This turned out to be what saved me today. 

I had noticed this lovely dwarf woman there with her kids, and she seemed very nice, patient with her kids, and was objectively beautiful. If I weren't married, and it wouldn't have been creepy as fuck, I might have told her that she was gorgeous since I'm sure she is subject to judgement all the time. Obviously I didn't, because both of the above are true, and you never know how people will take sincere compliments these days. 

Our kids played a couple of games together by happenchance, and though we never spoke, she acknowledged my presence with a polite smile, and I did the same. About thirty minutes later, my family and I were getting ready to leave, and I asked my wife where our daughter was.

Here is where the fuck up happened. One of my nicknames for my daughter is ""munchkin"". I call her munchkin, munchkin runt, munch, munchkin runtchkin, etc. So, instead of using her name when asking my wife, I said ""Where is the munchkin?"", to which she replied ""Right around the corner"". At that moment, I see the once lovely dwarf lady lean out from behind a machine *right around the corner* and fucking GLARE at me with a horrible scowl. My daughter was around the back of another machine about 20 feet away. I smiled at her in an attempt to convey that I wasn't in any way speaking about her, but she stormed off and I could feel the color either filling or draining from my face (not sure which) in embarrassment, fear, and guilt. 

A Chuck E. Cheese employee (who we see all the time) came over to me and asked me what happened as ""A lady had complained that I was using derogatory terms about her"". I quickly explained what happened, and luckily he remembered that I had called my daughter ""munchkin"" on multiple occasions in the past that he had overheard. He went to the woman and explained this to her, and I saw her have the same reaction that I did, of embarrassment and guilt. I tried to approach her to apologize, but she noped out of the door and I never got to say ""I'm sorry"".


Oh well, I got like 3000 tickets for my kids, and a story to tell. I still feel bad, though.

tifu,"Last night my sister and I were smoking in my room. We've done this every night for the past week and we always make sure to blow the smoke out the window and use febreeze right after a hit. Last night I guess that we got a bit too confident and we just blew the smoke in the room thus making the whole room smell like weed. At this point it was like 2:00 am and we didnt think anyone would notice the smell as long as we keep the window open all night and spray febreze in the room. 

We went back to lay down on own seperate beds and my sister decided to call my cousin after trying to sleep for like a whole hour. I was really curious as to what she was doing so I got down from my bed and went to see what they were talking about. At this point I was really high. Apparently I was being really loud without noticing it. My cousin had a bottle of tequila and she asked if we wanted to drink with her over face time so I went to the kitchen to go grab a bottle from the liquor cabinet. We started drinking straight from the bottle at the same time when my grandma walks in the room and I just throw the bottle under the bed.

Right as she walks in she asks ""what are you doing!?"". I try too look away so she doesn't notice my red eyes and my sister shows her her phone and says ""we're talking on the phone with my cousin"". My cousin says hi to my grandma and my grandma says hi back. And right as she says hi she starts sniffing the room and asks ""Omg why does it smell like marijuana in here?"". My sister and I look at each other in panic and I say ""Its because the window is open and the neighbors were smoking just a minute ago"". I try really hard to not let her see my eyes. I get up on my bed while she stares my sister and I down and she takes a good look at me and asks ""what's wrong with you, are you ok?"" I reply ""yeah I'm fine just sleepy"". She said ok and then started to walk out the room. When she opens the door she looks down and she says "" why is there a towel under the door?"" At this point I'm having a panic attack. I look at her for a good 2 seconds and she says ""If I find out you guys are smoking marijuana in here I'm going to tell your mom"".

She left the room and she took the towel with her. Right as we heard her door to her room close we got right back up and put the bottle and the weed in my school bag. Then we opened the window and proceeded to panic. We thought that she might be telling my mom about how it smelled in weed in our room but we couldn't tell because we were absolutely fucked up. I couldn't tell if I was hearing things or if my grandma was actually talking to my mom. I was awake until like 4 am. And right as I was finally falling asleep I hear the door to our room open again. I try really hard to act like I'm sleeping. She stands at the door for a while and I think I hear crying. She stood there for what seemed like an hour before she went up to the window and closed it back up.

I woke up this morning really early after getting like three hours of sleep. I opened the window up and sprayed what seemed like half a bottle of febreeze in my room. After that I went into the kitchen and saw my mom. She asked me if I wanted breakfast. I guess my grandma didnt feel like getting us in trouble. Its 4:00 PM right now and I dont know if she might say anything but I'm scared. I'm never going to smoke in my room again. I think I might as well just quit smoking weed altogether.

tifu,"The other post about the 9 year old reminded me about this.

I used to work with a guy we'll call Tom. Tom wasn't a midget, but was a twin with some disorder that left him very short for his age. He was so short that he had to have a stool to see over the cash register. If you didn't know he was 26 he could easily be mistaken for a child. I think you can see where this is going.

One day as I was leaving work I see Tom walking down the side of the road, and I decide to offer Tom a ride home. So I pull over and shout ""Hey Tom do you need a ride?"", But he just completely ignores me and keeps walking. So I shout even louder ""what are you doing dude, get in the damn car!"". The guy turns around and that's when I realized my fuck up, because this was not Tom but some little kid who just happens to look just like him. The kid looks at me terrified and just starts to book it.  Not wanting to explain myself to his angry parents I take off too.

tifu,"This story happened some time ago, but I'm new on Reddit and I wanted to shared this, because this story still turn me red when I think about it. 

So I was casually out with some of my friends, talking about our lives and catching up. After half an hour we basically stopped talking and I grab my phone, go to check Facebook. After a few scroll, I found a stupid statistic, the kind of stupid post you find on Facebook, on the number of children that actually don't know their real father because the woman was unfaithful (I don't really remember but the stat said around 1 out of 10 ish). So to start a new topic and avoid a longer blank between us, I start:
""Wooo, I just read something insane: 1 kid out of 10 don't know his real father, that's insaaaaaane""
One of my friend, let's call him A, just look at me, dead in the eye.

Now, most of you probably already figured it out, but I guess I was pretty stupid at the time (still am) so I go: ""Do you even realize, that's totally nuts! I mean one out of ten..."" 
""Jay"" says A, ""stop""
""Just imagine! That means, in this room, one of us don't know who his real father is!"" 
Aaaaaaaaand obviously, friend B starts crying, and it took me a couple of second to realize what I just did. 

The rest of the night was awful. Plus I never get to apologize to her, never saw her after that.

Not only that but it has various special functions. It rotates at selectable speeds and has a clitoral stimulator that has more modes than an Apple Watch.

So later that evening she has a test of this giant pink crusader and I can’t help but feel slightly absent. I’m basically just there dick in hand like I’m last in the queue.

I start suggesting how it doesn’t really look like it’s doing anything that would be enjoyable but she’s all “it’s actually really good”.

Not only that but this piece of vibrating, rotating pink plastic produced the goods way faster than I could ever managed, I’d swear it was mocking me.

Now considering this was my idea to start with, I think I hate it. At one point she joked about using it on me!

What the f\*\*k have I done.

So by thinking I was adding a little spice to the bedroom I may have ended up making myself even more redundant.

tifu,"First:
I'm German, on mobile, first post, yada yada.

Its a lovely Friday and I am on my way to the local trainstation, the bus is a bit late but that doesn't bother me. From home I brought a bottle of Coke which I drank a lot of in the bus. Bus and train are arriving at the same time so I'm sprinting to the train which waits only a minute. After 50 Meters I reach a wagon, but I'm traveling first class so I'm walking through the train to find first class. I'm making my way through the crowd looking left and right at some people that I pass, when because of my sprint, the pressure of the gas from my Coke on my tummy went unnoticed so high that now I'm releasing the loudest belch of my life right in the face of an elderly woman. I've never been so embarrassed, so I just escaped the scenery without even apologising. I foundnd the first class and tried very hard to forget what just happened. Unfortunately for me and lucky for you I didn't, what makes me feel bad about it every time I remember it. I know it's a bit anticlimactic but I wanted to share this Fuck-Up of mine. Unfortunately I couldn't apologise at all so;
Dear women,
I am so unbelievably sorry about the incident.
Sincerely KaosKanone.

I hope you enjoyed my Fuck-Up, have a nice day,
Sincerely KaosKanone!


P.S.
Hopefully Rslash will see this Post, he's the best. (Or I'm just a fan (I guess I am probably just a fan))


P.P.S. I just failed uploading this Post 6 times, a good start I hope!

tifu,"This happened like 5 minutes ago. I have an electric guitar and i really love playing it with just pants on. 

Today, my mom, my dad and my brother went to the neighbour's place to drink coffee. 

The weather was so hot so I got naked. I played for like an hour. Me and my family always argue about my guitar amp is so loud. And I said, here is the chance to play it loudly, and I did it. 

It was really fun but suddenly, My dad and our neighbour's daughter who is the same age with me suddenly went in to my room and saw me naked. Then my dad laughed and said get dressed. I can't tell you how embarrassed I am. I can not get out of my room. I think I will wait till she leaves.

TL;DR I played guitar naked knowing that my family was not home. I got caught on neighbour girl",TIFU by playing guitar naked.
tifu,"So I, like many others, have locked themselves out of something. Their car, their house, their workplace, etc. But I, dear fuck-ups, have done it multiple times, and today (actually today) was no exception and I had to put my learned 'It Takes a Thief' and ninja skills to the test.

For context, I've been renting this place for almost a year now and due to renew my contract, which I really hope to be able to do but now for more than one reason am a little bit nervous about the consequences. It's a house in a nice, safe neighbourhood with a reasonable amount of rooms divided into bedrooms. I share a full kitchen and bathroom with just two other roommates, the rent is amazingly perfect and affordable, the house is updated, and the land lady and her family are super awesome about keeping everything updated, fixed, and helping us out.

So here's my fuck up. My door's lock is opposite to what I'm used to for locked vs unlocked, and every single morning, despite living here for almost a year, get it wrong and it takes a couple of tries to get it open in my sleepy state (despite sleeping in until 10:30- mornings are rough). As usual, I finally fumble the door open- but clearly did not unlock it all the way and half locked it again. I took a step outside my bedroom to go to the bathroom, when the wind gently blew my door shut before my usual double-check. That instantly woke me up. I tried the handle- definitely, absolutely locked. No phone, no computer, no wallet, definitely no keys- just me in my pjs and my contact lenses now locked outside of my bedroom (thank god I don't have to go to work today).

After putting in my contacts I contemplate my situation and potential schemes to get back into my room. I figured the best way was to take out the screen of the kitchen and walk carefully across the roof of the porch as I lived on the second floor beside the kitchen, and just push my screen in. Thankfully I've always been leaving my window open a bit lately since the summer air has been super nice. I struggled with the kitchen screen a bit, and after a little while gave up as my energy was low. It was still morning, after all.

I contemplated asking my roommate (who works from home) to contact our land lady to see if she or her family could come over to unlock my door. I wanted to avoid this, however, because since near the beginning I ended up getting a mini fridge without telling them (we don't pay for utilities or internet, super awesome land lady) because the main fridge broke down a few times, over condensates, and even on the coldest setting is just luke cold. So if they see I have a mini fridge I might have to pay extra for rent, which I cannot afford right now. Also I want to avoid the shame of not telling them about the main fridge and suggesting getting a new one, as they're super nice and understanding. My other roommate seems to be happy enough with the fridge, despite his fruits and veggies getting mouldy after a week, so I just didn't say anything... Also I'd rather they not see my embarrassingly messy room...

Anyways, I give up after eating an ice cream (I needed a morally-boosting breakfast and some instant energy) and asked my roommate for her phone. Thankfully she was available, but her daily phone meeting was in five minutes. I didn't get an instant hold of my land lady and I decided to make a cup of tea and contemplate my technology-less morning in my pjs. After about almost an hour my roommate comes down to say that my land lady texted back, saying she wouldn't be able to come by 'til 6pm. I wasn't gonna sit around in my pjs without technology or internet memes all day, no way. I asked her for bobby pins (which failed) and so yet again I decided to try the screen.

After examining the window again and understanding how various window screens work I was able to take the screen out. Thanks to the cool show I watched when I was younger called 'It Takes a Thief', which is about two former criminals who (with permission) break into people's homes to illustrate how easy it is and educate how to prevent burglaries in simple steps. Because of this show I learned how to break into my parents' homes when we were locked out, looking for opportunities and understanding various window types. I've crawled over fences, through the kitchen window, through back windows, all of it because my family apparently has a gene where it's common to lock ourselves out of our stuff.

I walked carefully low across the porch roof to my own window, my nerves apparently stronger than my usual vertigo, hoping dearly that my quaint and well-to-do neighbours wouldn't spy me breaking into my room in my pjs and teal flip-flops. Through the screen I was able to shift the window open enough, and tried to push the screen through. Unfortunately I had no choice but to bend the frame slightly, but didn't snap or break it. Thankfully because I am a petit 5'3 woman, I was able to slide myself through, into my room.

Now I've been resting in my room, a little worn and tuckered out due to having the body of a Victorian lady yet ambition and schemes of a ninja. I'm a bit worried if I'll have to let my land lady into my room, seeing my mess and mini-fridge to see if I have to in the least pay any damages, more rent for my mini-fridge, or at most risk being able to renew my contract to stay here.

**TL;DR** Foolishly locked myself out of my own bedroom due to being not a morning person, crawled out onto the porch roof to break into my own room by bending the screen of my window, and am now worried if I'll have to pay for it, via damages or risking my renting contract.",TIFU by breaking into a house that's technically not my own
tifu,"This all happened about ten minutes ago.

So I was playing Minecraft and I randomly got extremely horny so I go into my bathroom and I pretend to take a shower. I load up a random ""step brother fucks stepsis video"" and I start to fap. Being the dumbass I am I put the shower on without thinking about the temperature. (This will be important later) as I fap the room fills with steam but I am too horny to notice. I randomly think that's it's a  good time to look aty own dick. I start to cum and it shoots out with the force of a thousand men. The massive cumshoy goes directly into my face and I think to myself: oh shit better go wash this off. I step into the shower and it is the coldest shower I've ever been in. I managed to use up all the hot water in my 20 minute fap. I shriek and as I take a breath the cum shoots into my mouth and I start to choke and gag. Cum tasted bad tho. Needs more pineapple juice.

tifu,"I felt like I wanted to share this out (this happened months ago but there was many events happening with this) because it has literally been my worst mistake ever. I had recently got a laptop, and I was having major fun with it. One night I stayed up really late grinding on GTAV and I decided call it a night with my friends. I get off, and I think to myself ""I feel like watching YouTube."" Now I'm already damn sleepy but I wanted to catch up on some videos. So before I K.O. my laptop started dying, so my natural response was to plug it in. Immediately after that I passed the fuck out. Morning comes, my grandmother wakes me up and tells me to unplug my stuff, but I feel a really strong stinging sensation. I decide to ignore it, unplug and go back to sleep. I wake up, and it's still fucking there. I go to look, massive blister on my left leg. I decide to peel it and patch it up because I don't want a giant bubble on my leg.

 Speed up a month and a half later, it begins to scab, then automatically start peeling. (This happened twice, I was scared because I didn't know scabs can reheal after they automatically start peeling. Common sense because I'm retarded LMFAO) my first attempt in peeling was no success as it was glued to my skin like a liquid flex seal. Second attempt it comes off, but brings some of my leg meat with it... Got it cleaned up, went to the hospital. It was infected but it's healed up now. the look the doctor gave my dumbass was rather insane, as he said I needed surgery but shit I never got it. (still have a hole in my leg. But it's less deeper.)



TL;DR/Long Story Short: Fell asleep on my laptop adapter, woke up with massive blister, scabbed over, not knowing scabs reheal after being peeled on their own I peel it like a dumbass due to fear of infection, get one anyway, now stuck with a massive memory on my left leg

Moral of the story: DON'T PEEL SCABS, OR SLEEP WITH OVERHEATING ELECTRONICS IN YOUR BED. 💀",TIFU by falling asleep on my laptop adapter then making a poor decision later on.
tifu,"Last winter some friends of our children came over for an afternoon. They're really nice kids, around 10 or 11 years old, and get along really well with ours. Their parents came to pick them up when it was time to leave. The kids put on their boots and sweatshirts, but tucked their coats under their arms. 

it was cold outside. Really cold. Like bomb cyclone cold. Like leave your car running at the grocery store or it won't start up again cold. It's also a few hundred feet from our door to our driveway. And they were not wearing coats. Their parents told them to put on coats, but didn't pursue the matter any further. 

I have a bit of a dark sense of humor, and our yard looked like a wind swept prairie. I told them they had better put their coats on or their parents would have to bury them in a shallow snowdrift along the way back to the car, like unfortunate groups caught in snow on the Oregon trail. 

Nobody really laughed, but people often don't laugh at my bad humor. As soon as they got out the door, my wife hit me and and asked what the fuck is wrong with me. I mean it was a dumb comment, but not out of line with my usual dumb comments. That's when it hit me.

Their older brother had committed suicide days before. The kids were at our house so their parents could make funeral arrangements and the kids could play and forget their current situation for a little bit. One of them had found their brother, and the kids were already in therapy. 

I was too mortified to call the parents and apologize, and I'm sure they were furious. I texted an apology, explaining how insensitive and blundering and sorry I was, and offered no excuse. Through text, they laughed it off, but we haven't seen them since.

tl;dr I made a dead kid joke with kids who had just lost their sibling. 

Edit: I know I know, I am the asshole. It is one of those things that randomly pops into my head, and whenever it does, I'm mortified all over again and spend the next hour thinking about what an idiot I am.",TIFU by making an Oregon trail joke
tifu,"This happened a couple years back and I hope she doesn’t see this because I feel horrible. I don’t ACTUALLY know if I was the main cause but since I only know the aftermath I can only assume.

When I was in high school (probably 7 years ago during my sophomore year) I sat at the back of the bus on the new route they had recently put me on. There was a girl I already knew who was talking to someone I didn’t know. I decided to join in the conversation because I was bored and because why not. The girl I didn’t know (we’ll call her A) was talking to my friend (B), and now at this point to me, about how she was having problems with her boyfriend and how she felt like he was going to break up with her. She also mentioned that she felt like it was because she was a virgin and wouldn’t have sex with him. 

Trying to be the cool teenager that I wasn’t I chimed in with something along the lines of, “You should go for it and have sex with him. Sex is great!” I kept talking about how fun it was and how it’s totally worth it. I was playing myself up like a sexpert even though my boyfriend and I had only done it maybe once. After a little bit I realized what I was doing, cringed a little internally, and threw in at the end about how she needed to really do what she felt was best and that if she lost her virginity she might regret it in an attempt to try and backtrack my earlier spew of sex nonsense.

I guess my backtrack didn’t work because that was the last time I saw her. I asked B where A had been since I hadn’t seen her in a while and B told me that A’s aunt caught her having sex with her boyfriend and was sent away to an entirely different state. I’ve felt so bad ever since. I don’t know her name so I don’t know where she ended up or how her life turned out.

tifu,"This happened in April last year, when buying my new car and in the process of selling my old one. 

I bought my new car from a dealership and the guy processing my purchase asked if I wanted to assign my private licence plate to my new car, so that it's ready for when I'm ready to drive it. However, i couldn't because it was still assigned to my old one, which was still in use because i had to wait 2 weeks to be able to drive my new car. 

Fast forward two weeks and I'm in a mad rush to drive my new car. I switch my car insurance over to insure the new car and get it taxed so i can legally drive it. 

My old car was sold around a month after getting my new car, this is also when I assigned my private plate from my old car to my new one. It was official, my new car was now on the private plate.

All was well up until Friday 7th June this year where i have a letter from the motor insurer's bureau telling me that my car is uninsured. This was confusing because i remember insuring it when I was ready to drive it last year and I also renewed it a month or two ago. I thought this was odd until I realised that the letter pointed out that my new car was on my private plate. 

It instantly dawned on me that I had insured my car using its original plate and had never told my insurance company that I had changed the plates. So I was driving about pretty much uninsured. I rushed upstairs, checked my documentation (to make sure) and low and behold, my car was insured on its old plates! 

I rang my insurance company and sorted everything out. Fortunately, the changes have taken place and now it is properly insured with the correct licence plate. Best part of this is that I have put 17,000 miles on my car and driven all over the country in it, past multiple ANPR cameras, police vehicles, on several motorways and even in to city centers and I have never been pulled over or prosecuted for it which makes me think it was a technical glitch of sorts.

Forgot to tell my insurance provider that I had switched number plates on my car and was essentially driving around uninsured for more than a year/ 17,000 miles.",TIFU by driving around in my car uninsured for an entire year

More like Yesterday I Fucked Up. God! Just thinking about it makes want to go jump in a lake. 

Anyway, yesterday was our Saturday monthly movie night where a bunch of my friends get together, get super baked and binge on Series or Movies. We decided on Black Mirror since season 5 had just come out. 

Couple of joints later, we started watching episode 1. I don't know if any of you experience this, but when I get high, I get hyper focused on a single thing and forget about anything else in my peripherals. This is exactly what happened to me during that episode. I became so focused I forgot that there were 5 other people around me. And Then I started getting turned on. It's was an incredible feeling, like you become aware of every nerve in your body. Every single movement you make, every single touch on your skin feeling like a bolt of electricity is pulsing throughout your whole body. 

I get hotter and hotter as the episode progresses, feeling like my clit was connected directly to a live wire, until we reach the Birthday VR Scene where I completely lose my self and cum like my life depended on it. I didn't even realize I was moaning until I was done and realized that all my friends were looking at me with one of them holding her phone which was pointed at me. Probably filmed the whole thing. It was so mortifying. I felt like a bucket of cold water had just been dumped on me. I left and went home immediately after that.

I'm so embarrassed!!

My friends keep calling but I'm not planning on talking to them any time soon. Just until the shame wears off.

Probably not gonna work since they know where I live.

TL;DR Got high with a bunch of friends and watched Black  Mirror. Ended up having an Orgasm while watching one of the VR Scenes in episode 1.

Update: My friends came over. I woke up and found them in my apartment (I'm not sure how I feel about my spare key being used like this). Apparently, since I was avoiding them, they decided to come to me. They were really cool about. I mean, they made fun of me, but in a nice way. They wanted me not feel in any way ashamed of what happened. They were pretty awesome. 
My friend apologized for filming me. I forgave her cause she looked like she really felt awful about it and we deleted the video. 
Watched it though. Not as bad as I thought it would be. I wasn't as loud as I thought I was. I mean, I was still loud enough that the people around me noticed but at least I wasn't doing the porn star shrieks I had imagined in my head.",TIFU by having an Orgasm while watching Black Mirror S5 NSFW

When I was hired in, my boss was about to give birth which meant I only really got to know her for a week before our interm boss arrived. I had to speak with my boss so I was in her office. The interm director was also in there. After, I walked back into my office and saw my phone sitting on my desk. That is when I had a moment of strong confusion as I realized there was a phone in my pocket. I pulled it out and asked my staff if this was either of their phones. Negative. That's is when, to my horror, I began to realize that I had just intentionally stolen my boss's phone. Luckily, the manager of housekeeping is a saint. She took the phone and asked if it was either of the boss's. They were very confused but were light hearted. That is when I decided it would be better to be up front and honest. I walked in and apologized for the misunderstanding. Muscle memory must have kicked in and in my attempt to never forget my phone, I stole my interm boss's phone. Luckily for me, both of them are amazing people. They thought it was hilarious. I, on the other hand, was attempting not to pass out and get fired simultaneously. Everything turned out fine.

tifu,"This happened early this morning while i was walking home from the bar.  I called a cab to give me a ride and waited for 27 minutes for one to arrive.  The town i am staying in kind of sucks for cabs, they don’t bother asking who called them and just let anyone pile in.  So a group of people who came outside 15 minutes after i had already been outside waiting jumped into the cab i had been waiting for and took off.

So i got irritated and decided to walk instead, it’s about an hours walk so i could of been half way home already if i hadn’t of waited for that taxi.  My calves will often tighten up on me when i start walking and i have two options, push through the pain and they will usually stop hurting, or stop and let them relax then i can start walking again and they won’t tighten up again.

This evening they started tightening up just as i got to a bridge that crossed a river.  I got about half way across the bridge and decided that it was a good spot to stop and let my calves relax before continuing and just listen to the running water under the bridge while i waited and relax.

Well i wasn’t there very long and i was surprised by police lights turning on.  I turned and seen the vehicle pulling up, and was confused as to why they were stopping at first.  The officer got out and asked me if everything was alright, and i must of sounded weird when i said yes with a confused tone in my voice.

He then asked “your not thinking of jumping are you?”  I laughed and said “fuck no, do you know how shallow that water is.”  I then kind of started realizing what it looked like, 3am, guy standing on a bridge looking down at the water.

He said he was driving by and seen me and just wanted to check and make sure everything was alright.  I thanked him for stopping and told him i liked the sound of the water was all and that i would continue on my way so he didn’t have to worry about me anymore.  He looked fairly young and i think i heard him sigh in relief as i continued my walk home that night.

 So as background: I can't say anything correctly. I have this compulsive, constant, dry humor that makes its way out through word association. Whether it's ""Billy"" being called ""Willy"" or something opposite like ""coldcat"" instead of ""hotdog,"" for some reason I can't bring myself to use the right words. Sometimes people around me start using these terms and it means we all speak gibberish. I won't post any of the popular made up words for fear that someone I know will Google it and find this post.

Anyway, my coworker brings his dog in all the time and after a while, like clockwork, I had to give her (the dog) a wrong name. Her real name is something like Margret Johnson (not really but again, I'm not trying to have this post give me away). I see this dog after getting to know her a few times and greet her with her new fake name...

And the first thing I come up with is ""Margie J."" It's an instant hit and everyone, including customers, call this dog Margie J.

Here comes the TIFU.

I was walking home today unpacking my day in my head, and I remembered seeing Margie J. and I thought ""How tf did i come up with that name? Was it from something?"" This thought retreats to the back of my mind.

Fast forward to the evening and I fancied myself a wank. So I get in the shower, load up private browsing on my phone, and start to browse some good ol' transgender smut. I click a video  starring a popular actress in this specific genre of porn and realized:

That's where I got the name. Bailey Jay. Margie J. Fuck.

Now I don't think any of my coworkers are into the same ""material"" as myself but if someone on the off chance finds out about this actress, the verbal similarity to the nickname I made up will be uncanny.

They'll know I'm into chicks with dicks. 

I'm not shaming people for their sexual preferences/ gender identification: quite the opposite. Privately, I'm very comfortable with my tastes and desires. However, I just prefer my professional life stay separate from my porn preferences. Ultimately wouldn't be a huge deal but they'd know then I'd know that they know and I'm not sure I want people I work with to know, you know?

Okay so this happened yesterday at IKEA Tampa. And I have no idea why someone did it. 

After coming out of IKEA, as it's pouring cats and dogs, I run over to get my car to load the paper furniture my wife bought only to find the car won't start. After finally finding someone to help jump start my car (apparently in the rain there are a lot less people willing to help with this ;). Unfortunately the car won't crank still, so it's not a dead battery. 

So I do the next thing that comes to mind and start checking all the fuses under the hood. They all look fine so I go look under the dash fuse box and discover the cover laying on floor. So without thinking much of it I start checking all fuses to do with the electrical system only to find the starter fuse missing and then it hits me.

Someone entered my car and stole a fuse. The crazy part is I had my iPad pro sitting on the rear seats and some cash in the center console which they didn't bother taking.

Is there some sort of new prank the kids play nowadays? Or maybe its some kind of revenge people do for pissing them off on the road or parking lot?

We were cuddling on her couch, a few kisses here and there, my hand inching closer to her breast, which it finally found with no objection from the lady. It was the fourth or fifth date so I kind of expected some action. She suggested we watch a movie and walked over and crouched by her TV to put in a DVD. I was sitting in the couch still, thinking if I should walk over and give her a few more kisses, something else? So I got up and walked over to her and started rubbing her back, but was stopped dead in my tracks. She didn’t suggest a movie to watch a movie, or to set the atmosphere for some lovemaking. She suggested a movie to get away for a second. So she could fart. The stench could not be mistaken. I stayed rubbing her back and asked if she found a movie. She chose one, I went back to the couch, and she joined me five seconds later to cuddle. Eventually we resumed kissing and my hand found her boob again. No sex though.

Oh boy.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, here goes. I've been on this subreddit for a while, and have enjoyed the stories, so thank you all for that, haha.

I've considering posting this for a while, but couldn't muster up the courage to do so until, well, now.

Using a throwaway, and i don't think you guys need the explanation for this one :)

&amp;#x200B;

So, surprise surpise, this story is not from today. Im 16 at the time. As most of you probably were too, i was quite fond of the act of playing with my peen, sure you can relate. The thing is, i hate when it gets messy, and having to clean up. I never really understood why people would do their thing, and just wipe it up, i mean wouldn't your seeds still be like on your keyboard or whatever? Anyways, im getting off track.

So my parents rarely come to my room, as it is upstairs, and they just yell for me if they need me. This is revisited later.

This one day, i don't really remember but knowing me, i was probably scrolling facebook and caught a glimpse of a hot girl and got my inner teenager awoken. I did the deed, and as i said earlier, i don't like when it gets messy, and didn't have any tissues at hand, so i uh, improvised.

My dad had this bag of chips which i brought upstairs prior to the uhh, incident. I ate them, but didnt feel like eating more and was just gonna throw them out, as all that was left of them were the broken crumb kind of thing on the bottom of the bag. I saw the bag, and ''improvised''. I gave my meat a good old rub, as my man Ainsley taught me, and i proceeded to defile the remaining chips. I put the bag away, and went downstairs to wash my hands and stuff, but i kinda forgot about the bag. I thought i'd just throw it out at night when everyone was sleeping, and didn't think much of it. Now, what i don't quite know is how long the chips were out for. A day, two, or what, since i have a bad habit of forgetting to take stuff with me downstairs when i go, but im positive the chips weren't there for that long. What i do know is that the chips were DEFINATELY hit with my peen juice.

So, remember when i said my parents rarely come upstairs to my room? Well my dad did. I'm sitting at my pc, and not paying attention to what my dad is doing, just talking to him as i play my game. I turn to him, and to my absolute indescribable horror, i see my lovely dad, who deserved so much better than what was waiting for him, with the bag of chips in his hand. Before i can even react, he throws his hands inside, fumbles it around in there to catch some of the tiny crushed chips, and proceeds to eat them and fold up the bag(presumably to throw it away).

I'm sitting there, horrified, wishing my eyes hadn't existed, and i watch him go back downstairs. He didn't notice my bodily fluid on the chips(if it was even fluid at that point), and went on with his day.

&amp;#x200B;

I sat there in horror for several minutes, wishing i didn't exist.

I still get reminded of this, and it is probably the single one memory i'd wipe from my brain if i could.

Again sorry for length.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I shot my load into an almost empty bag of chips, my dad came up and ate my children.

tifu,"Decided it was a great idea to take one of those electric scooters you see around a lot of cities for a ride. All was going well until about 2 hours in. I was following a friend on his scooter and he drove up onto a sidewalk, when I went to follow him my back tire caught the end of the sidewalk and sent me flying forward. 

Pretty sure I blacked out at this point because i remember waking up like i was in a FPS video game and seeing my friend try to stop the bleeding. Another woman stopped and came out of her car to call an ambulance

Don’t remember much after that except for arriving in the hospital. Got some nice road rash all over my face and a couple stitches on the nose along with a broken pinkie and some cuts and bruises all over my arms.

tifu," This didn't actually happen yesterday but it's still ongoing. I'm just finished my first year in college and I've never had a girlfriend or had sex. This is mostly due to a lack of confidence and generally not knowing what to do. So there's this girl in my classes in college who I really like and I thought she liked me as I saw her starring at me a few times and she would generally smile at me when I saw her. I had thought of asking her out for a while but never did as I always made excuses, the main one being she was with friends. 

Well a few days ago I saw her alone on campus and thought this was my chance. I walked passed her and we both said hello but I pussied out of asking. I walked on a bit and then turned around to go back and ask but pussied out again and walked straight passed her without saying anything. This happened about 5 times and there was eye contact each time. Eventually I went up to her and asked if she wanted to hang out, she said yes but she had something to do and would be free a few hours later (this was in the late afternoon) and so she gave me her number.

It was my birthday that day and so had plans to go out with friends that night. Because I live an hour away from my college I went home to get ready to go out with friends. I sent her a text explaining everything, the problem was that she didn't enter the call code correctly and so the text didn't send, I didn't notice this. 

So, we had agreed to meet where I asked her, she waited there for me and I never showed up and she didn't have my number so she couldn't call me. I only realised the mistake the day after when I wondered why she hadn't sent a text back. I decided that I would just tell her the story in person the next time I saw her. 

The next time I saw her in college she looked super pissed off and flat out ghosted me and now I'm just too embarrassed to do anything about it. All her friends give me dirty looks and almost everyone knows about it in my course so there's essentially no chance of any future endeavors with girls from my course.

tifu,"Obligatory not today,  but a few years ago. I’m a freshman in college with a full-time that typically starts at 1 PM on weekdays. Classes end at noon, and I get a text from my then-girlfriend that her classes were canceled for the day and she had the house to herself, strongly suggesting I come over for a “lunch break”. I immediately text my boss feigning some emergency and rush to her place.

When I get there, we start start making out in the living room before taking it to her bedroom. For some background, her parents have the master suite on the top floor, while the other bedrooms are on the ground floor, so it didn’t cross our minds to check upstairs. In the bedroom, I decide to mix it up a little - I pick her up so she is straddling me, and start lifting her up and down on my Johnson. I’m talking full on porn-star moves here when, all of a sudden, the door opens. 

Her mom, a conservative, Catholic, Hispanic woman - stares at us in our naked, pornographic glory before letting off a stream of Spanish profanities and slamming the door shut. I promptly drop my girlfriend on the bed, put my clothes on and leave (knowing that me being here for the next part would only make it worse). After giving my SO advice on what to say, I return a few hours later to profusely apologize for her having to see that. While we ended up breaking up, but it was a running joke for a few years till then.

tifu,"This actually happened over the weekend and I'm using a throwaway as my family knows my normal account. Anyway, this happened when my wife and I attended my Mom's birthday party over the weekend. I think it's silly, but the incident resulted in my sister and bro-in-law flipping out and dubbing me as being a bigot. They called me a 'disgusting individual' all based on a comment I made which I don't believe they really understood. While at the party, in a casual conversation, my wife and I were asked what movies we saw recently, and the live-action Disney remake of Aladdin was brought up. We saw it a week ago and my bro-in-law asked what we thought of it. My wife enjoyed it, and I chime in and say ""It was good, but it seems like many new movies nowadays are injecting feminism into the plot and it feels kind of forced."" I struck a nerve with that comment and my sister berated me with swear words and slurs telling me I was a horrible person and that I was a male chauvinist. My brother-in-law swooped in saying ""Whoa dude, what crazy right-wing conservative YouTubers are you following to corrupt your thinking like that..."" Mind you I don't get my news/politics off of YouTube, etc. I mean, I typically listen to NPR while I'm driving, so yea, I'm kind of boring.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, I was taken back by their reactions. My point which I'm sure people may disagree with was that the new Aladdin movie changed the original plot and I didn't think it was necessary. So, I explained to them that what I meant was that it seems like everything gets politicized lately and my observation and opinion about this one movie didn't mean that I am against women. I actually believe I am progressive with regards to my political views and was surprised that one comment I made resulted in them verbally assaulting me. I took it a step further and told them my POV relating to feminism and how I fully support the belief that women should be equal in society relating to wages, employment, and opportunities, etc. Unfortunately, it didn't matter. My fate was sealed after I said that lots of movies nowadays seem to force these issues on viewers. There's nothing wrong with raising awareness and doing so with new content, sure I'm all for it! But I became the bigot because I said that I didn't think it was needed as a plot point in this particular movie.  This resulted in an argument flawed by circular reasoning in which the starting point and conclusion was that I was a bigot. I finally ended the discussion by saying that I truly do believe in equality and if they choose to accept my position, fine, and if not, that is their prerogative. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't get this mentality today of 'If you don't fully agree with me or my way of thinking, you are emphatically against me..."" Digressing from the details of the argument, the end result was that a discussion politics ruined the good time everybody was having causing friends and family to leave early . Nobody wanted to engage in the arguing. My sister left being angry with me and telling me I was no longer invited to my nieces upcoming birthday. I apologized to my Mom and left it at that.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I feel bad that I contributed to ruining the party. I also feel that what I said was misinterpreted and that all logic and reasoning was thrown out the window resulting in an emotionally charged argument. Family drama sucks and I'm pretty sure I won't be invited to some future events that haven't been announced yet.

I’m brushing my teeth, mindful of my still tender gums (last week I had my wisdom teeth removed), when I spy something in my peripheral vision: it’s just my cat, Stormy, trotting gaily up the stairs. I ignore her and keep brushing my teeth; I’m exhausted!

I’m heading back to my room to get my retainer when I notice something in her mouth. I don’t have to wonder about it for too long, because only seconds later, Stormy has dropped a very alive, very active mouse onto the carpet. My mind is screaming: please, please don’t let it run into my room! I’m praying, even though I’m an atheist, to every deity I’ve ever heard of.

tifu,"Yup, this is another “this happened about ten years ago” story. Only it was seventeen years ago - Spring of 2003.

One of my best friends had been dating this girl for a year or so. We’ll call him Darrell Waltrip, and her Miss Scarlett Trudeau. We were seniors in high school, and a part of a fairly tight-knit group of about 5 people. Darrell was always with Scarlett, and I was always with Darrell.

&amp;#x200B;

In the early Spring of 2003, I heard from 3 different sources that Scarlett had been sleeping with some guy she worked with. This was coming from her best friend (my ex-girlfriend), my then-girlfriend, and a third girl I’d known since middle school. These three girls weren’t all that friendly with each other, so I figured some kind of malicious coordinated effort wasn’t particularly likely. Considering the fact that Scarlett had started pursuing Darrell before ending things with her previous boyfriend, it all seemed pretty legit.

&amp;#x200B;

I played with in a band with Darrell with my other best friend, who shall be known as Gareth Feigenbaum. Gareth and I got to talking about it, and basically concluded that we had to tell Miss Scarlett to either come clean, or that we would tell Darrel ourselves. I still vividly remember sitting in Economics class and drawing a mind map (like they taught us to make for our persuasive essays) to plan out our blistering ultimatum. Gareth wanted to include the fact that her breath smelled bad (it did). I insisted that we stay on-topic, and Gareth got irritated and made his own mind map titled “[Why Terry can suck it](https://imgur.com/7zqEaO6).” If you can’t make them out, the branches are “I heard he hates cats --- also beats other various animals,” “He likes girls ----- Ewwy girls,” “I think he stole some of my drum sticks,” “He always tried to embarrass me in front of my friends,” “Only cares about himself,” “He is always making fun of my ideas,” and “He is mean to Gareth.”

Oh and my name is Terry in this story. Terry Wildman.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I finish the note. Shortly after, I see Scarlett in the hall after 2nd block as I did every day, and passed her the note. Sadly, I do not remember the contents of the note, but I’m sure the righteous indignation would make me cringe my face off.

&amp;#x200B;

SMASH CUT TO: “Terry Wildman to the counselor’s office. Terry Wildman to the counselor’s office.” Oh boy. The Wild Man had really done it this time.

&amp;#x200B;

I walked into the counselors office, and there’s Miss Scarlett, glaring at me, red-eyed and absolutely \*pissed\*. Catching that look took years off my life, I think. The feeling has really stuck with me. To make it even worse, Scarlett’s aunt was the Boss Counselor. I made that title up, but she was in charge if the department or coven or whatever. So now I’m sitting in a room with Gareth and Scarlett and Scarlett’s aunt, talking about this awful situation that was never supposed to involve The Adults. Scarlett is categorically denying it. And my dumb ass can’t believe that this isn’t wrapping up neatly.

&amp;#x200B;

It comes out pretty quickly that we heard this story from multiple sources, so Auntie Counselor calls in all the girls to basically repeat what we’d already heard. Although I can’t remember if Scarlett was allowed to stay in the room for this part (probably not), no one backed down on their story - they all even knew the guy’s name. I wonder now if guidance counselor's played arbiter of teenage drama like this in other schools. Seems really weird in retrospect.

&amp;#x200B;

So naturally, Darrell was called in shortly after. He was, as I remember, devastated but stoic. My memory is pretty fuzzy on this part of the story, but I remember him just walking out of the office at a certain point. Gareth, my girlfriend, and I went and just sat with him near the edge of the parking lot as he processed. It was around noon at the point, and we decided to take a trip to McDonald’s to have lunch. We came back, and finished up the last couple hours of the school day normally. Darrell and Scarlett broke up.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days passed, and all of us - Darrell, my girlfriend, and I - got Saturday School. As a (mostly) good little boy, this was completely foreign to me. I specifically remember talking to the principal, who seemed to be giving out my punishment merely as a formality. He scrawled “out of pocket” on the paperwork. It was silly, but I understood that you can’t just let a kid skip half a school day for no reason other than “hanging with his friend who was dealing with some junk.” I’m sure I had to explain the whole thing to my parents at some point, but I don’t remember catching any flak. As it related to being disciplined, I felt righteous, and regretted nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday School was fine - After the busy work was done, I spent my time writing a very positive review of At The Drive-In’s Relationship of Command. I’m sure it would also make me cringe my face off.

&amp;#x200B;

How any of this played out between Scarlett and her aunt or anyone else employed by the school, I don’t know.

&amp;#x200B;

EPILOGUE: More time passed. Things were kind of weird that Spring. Scarlett started dating the notorious coworker soon after The Incident, albeit for a short amount of time. I don’t remember how this came about, but [she signed my yearbook](https://imgur.com/VZAzIl3) towards the end of the school year, saying I was still one one her best friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward about seven months - Scarlett comes over to Darrell’s house while I’m there (which I always was). It’s weird for me, but she and Darrell seem to be on good terms. I spent a good amount of time thinking about it in the following weeks - did I have a right to be mad at her when Darrell clearly wasn’t? Was it my place to even acknowledge to them the fact that I was confused? They eventually started dating officially again, and I said nothing. Scarlett and I resumed our friendship soon after, mostly as if nothing had happened. Scarlett had a GameCube, and Darrell and I destroyed all of her ex-fling’s best times on Mario Kart Double Dash. Because that is how you show dominance.

&amp;#x200B;

Scarlett and Darrel broke up about a year and a half later, shortly after Darell and I moved about an hour away for college. Over the course of three or four years, Scarlett and I got to the point where we didn’t speak at all. It wasn’t intentional, it just played out that way. We saw each other by chance a few years ago, and it was fine. But maybe a little chilly. I never put any effort into continuing our friendship, to be honest, and I suspect there may be some resentment there.

&amp;#x200B;

Darrell and I are still friends and hang out on occasion. Last October, we had our first children literally two days apart from one another. We’ve never had the kind of relationship where girlfriends and feelings are discussed, so I’ve never gotten the courage to ask what he thought happened. But again, I kinda felt that if he thought it was forgivable, I probably shouldn’t be bringing it up. At the very least, it was a convenient excuse for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven’t thought this hard about the whole incident in a really long time. With the advantage of hindsight, I’m not going to rule out that Gareth and I were \*completely\* wrong about the whole thing, that all three of these girls were just psychotic, conspiratorial liars, or that we were sticking our noses where they didn’t belong. But I doubt it.

&amp;#x200B;

For years, I entertained the idea that I’d one day ask Scarlett point-blank, what happened - if she had simply employed a “deny, deny, deny” tactic along with the unexpected move of involving her Counselor Aunt. But if she was willing to lie then, I had no real reason to think she wouldn’t a few years on, or even now that we’re in our 30s. I also doubt knowing the truth or hearing her apologize or whatever would do anything for me. And of course that would be the best-case scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn’t mean for this to turn into an overwrought writing class exercise complete with unnecessary photographic evidence, but here we are. Thanks for reading.

tifu,"First, just a short background to try to defend myself. It’s kind of an embarrassing to say, but my older sister is one of those stereotypical MLM huns (my sister is honest to God relentless, she is like fucking Thanos except instead of destroying the world, she just wants you to buy LuLaRoe or optavia or whatever the fuck it is, every day I wish she would apply that focus to something else). She bounces from one “business” to the other and is currently selling (or trying to sell) doTERRA. She’s hounded my parents and me and any family friends willing to listen to her. My mom always buys whatever it is to try to support her and so do some of my mom’s friends, who get trapped sometimes when they visit and end up buying just to end the awkwardness. She’s gone after my friends and coworkers before on FB before I unfriended her. Needless to say it’s kind of a high tension issue in my family. I tend to get irrationally annoyed just even at the sight of a Mary Kay bottle or a Lipsense tube, and I definitely avoid the topics of MLMs and don’t tell anyone about my sister.



I’ve been going out with my girlfriend for 2 years now. I basically never let her meet my sister and only brought her to my parents’ house when I know my sister isn’t there. My girlfriend likes makeup a lot and purchases new things frequently. I always pay a lot of attention to her makeup, to the point where she’s made comments about how she hasn’t had a boyfriend who’s that interested before. Like I would ask to see her lipstick when she’s putting it on after lunch or look at her eyeshadow palette when she’s doing her makeup. I feel kind of bad here because I think she’s genuinely excited that I’m interested but I’m really just checking to make sure they are not MLM brands. Her stuff usually have really fancy packaging and are from pretty expensive brands so I just assumed she’d be safe from MLMs if she ever meets a hun, just because they wouldn’t be up to her standards.



We moved in together two week ago and I got the shock of my life when I saw a whole army of those little 5ml amber bottles with amateur looking packaging all over her dresser. I asked her what they were and she said perfume oils and I know this sound dramatic, but I felt myself dying inside envisioning us married and her shilling “magic” oils to our friends. I tried to joke and said I thought she’d be the type to use Chanel perfumes and she just laughed and said something about how the mainstream brands don’t have the scents she want.



Here is where I should’ve been smart and rational and talked to her like a normal human being about MLMs and my family history with them and about how I don’t want her to use them, and then she would have had a chance to let me know that she bought those from actual independent perfume stores, who happened to sell their stuff in similar looking bottles. Or I could’ve even been my usual sneaky self and just checked her bottles and googled the brands. Instead I got weird and withdrawn for a whole week, right after moving in together, and then when I saw a stray bottle on the bathroom counter, threw it into the trash.



It turned out to be a discontinued scent and one of her favorites. When she asked me later if I have seen it, I told her what I did and it basically blew up into a huge fight where she thought I was regretting moving in together or having issues sharing space until I told her what’s going on. She then dragged me to her dresser and basically listed out each brand and made me go to each website so I could see that they are indeed, independent small businesses making perfume oils and have nothing to do with MLMs. We’ve made up now but I think I may have done some real damage to our relationship. She’s told me that she’s aware of MLMs and that she wouldn’t ever buy from them. Today she even showed me the new lipsticks she bought, but she just seemed sad now that she knows I was just checking to see if her makeups were MLMs. I apologized to her and told her that I trust her 100% and she didn’t need to show me if she didn’t want to but everything is just awkward now. I feel bad I threw out her favorite perfume and tried asking her what the name was, since I didn’t even look at it before I threw it out, but she just told me not to bother because it’s discontinued and I wouldn’t be able to find it for sale. I honestly feel so bad about all this and wish I could’ve just told her what was happening from the very beginning, now I feel like I just damaged my most important relationship with one of the best people in the world.

tifu,"This happened like 4 years ago, I was 17 at the time, just started college and was late to catch a bus. This day in particular was Diwali and I am a brown lady. 

I was walking briskly through my neighbourhood to get to a bus stop 20 minutes away. That bus supposedly would be at my stop in 17, so you best believe I was walking as quickly as I could. I'm paying attention to the cars in the driveways to be sure I don't get hit by anyone and notice that a brown woman just left her house and got in her car. I walk past her and get approximately 5 houses away before I notice that she's driving very slowly and seems to want to get my attention. I thought she wanted to tell me I dropped something or that my bag was wide open so I stop to see what was going on. 

She proceeded to ask me if I was headed to class (I was), how I was getting there (by bus) and if I knew where this family's house was (I did). She tells me that they are holding a little celebration for Diwali and felt too awkward to ask them what house they were. She then tells me that she is headed to the mall to get to the GO station and asks if I'd like a ride to the mall. I knew that I couldn't get to my bus stop in time because of her and I didn't want to wait for another bus (45 minute wait because the busing system sucks in my region) (I also didn't have Uber or any money to pay for a taxi nor was I about to skip/be late to class) so I tell her sure. I proceed to get in her car after checking that there was no other person back there. Nothing sketchy happens, we talk and I learn that her brother goes to the same college as I do. She thankfully dropped me off at a main intersection where my second bus could pick me up (I have to take three buses to get to the campus). I never saw her again but I do see her car often and I some times laugh at my stupidity. 

I'm fully aware that I risked my life getting into her car, I was smart enough to write her name down with a description of her car and the house number after she told me what it was before getting out of the car. I have since never done that, I triple check my Uber rides when I take them, any taxi I take I be careful with and I tell my parents about any ride that I take.

I was very excited about it, because nothing relieves my anxiety like being by the sea and I've had a bunch of shit giving me anxiety lately. Now, the fuck up is divded in two.

First of all, before going to the sea, I had a VERY hearty lunch at a local fair. Not only did I eat a lot, I also wolfed it down because it was very tasty.

I was so happy that I was feeling better and my anxiety and nausea were dying down, that I completely ignored the strenght of the wind. This was on the East coast of the UK. The one across from France, which had [a huge storm](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-48553351) this weekend. So I was chilling on the beach alone, with my headphones, getting odd looks from people but feeling quite at peace due to my music and the impromptu meditative state I usually get by the sea.

It's Monday and I am bedridden with the mother of all colds. I have a huge meeting tomorrow evening, a clogged nose, no voice left, and am slightly dizzy. However the anxiety's been gone for a couple of days, so there's that!

tifu," 

Discovered this sub today. I'll be dropping many stories in here about my dumpster fire of a life over time (becuase let me tell you I have a fucking database of this shit). I'll start with this gem from about a month ago.

I'm in college and I live about 15 minutes away from campus walking but less than 5 biking. About two weeks previous to when this happened my bike got stolen (rip a real one) so I was using my friends bike. I roll out of my house at 6am to go study for a 10am exam wearing my mens large sized sweats (for reference I am a 5'4"" girl) that drag a good 9 inches on the ground behind me when I'm walking. Maybe some of you see where this story is going.

I make it about 2 blocks down the street before my sweatpants get caught in the gears of this god damn bike that doesn't have a gear shift guard, proceeding to lock up the entire thing and catapult me over the handlebars. But but but, because I am attached by the leg to this bike, I can't completely catapult over and instead I get half way over before landing with my hips over the handlebars and a face full of tire. Then the bike tips over, the 35 pound back pack I'm wearing that flipped over my body lands on my head and I drop my lunch which scatters all over the street :( But I don't have time to wallow in my own misery because I'm in the middle of the fucking street, a bitch needs to move (although hindsight is 20/20, shoulda just let that be my time). So I drag my useless body over to the curb, scuttling like a gremlin with a lame leg bc it's still attached to the bike, dragging the damn thing behind me. So FINALLY I get to the curb, and I'm sitting there trying to jimmy my pants out of this bike but SIDE FUCKING NOTE this bitch is old as shit and has breaks that back pedal so the only way to get my pants out is to just get the pedals to move forward but this thing does NOT WANT TO FUCKING MOVE so I'm sitting there at 6am violently shaking my leg back and forth trying to just make it work. At this point I strongly debated just taking my pants off and making a run back to my house but I wasn't wearing underwear so that could've been problematic.

So after 10 minutes of me trying to get these FUCKING pants out of the bike, a jogger is coming by and sees me having a real time over here so she comes up and is like do you...... need help. So I graciously accept her help and for 5 more minutes we try and work together to get my pants out but its Not Fucking Happening and we end up using my house key as a shiv to just cut my pants out of the bike. So now we're rockin with one pant leg 2 inches shorter than the other but it's fine because honestly it's what you would expect from me anyways. So I FINALLY get my pants out of this thing and I collect my lunch from the middle of the street and I get back on the cursed metal death trap and get to campus where I realize that my friends bike lock is still laying at The Scene Of The Crime, so I have to go all the way fucking back there to get it.

By 7am a full hour later I finally get my shit together for a moment of peace but HOOOOO BOY did this one test me.

tifu,"Let me start off by saying that last weekend was a glorious and beautiful time for weather in Upstate New York. It was so glorious in fact that I decided to take the hard top off of my Jeep.

(You can probably understand where I'm going from here.)

Anyway, I woke up on a beautiful Saturday morning. The atmosphere was slightly foggy but the sun was quickly burning through the moisture. I thought, ""Today, I will finally get my yard chores done."" Let me tell you what, there's a shitload of mowing/weedwacking that needed done.

I ended up just weedwacking for the entire day. Them weeds were at least as tall as a child using growth enhancers. It took a grand total of three or four hours just to weedwack. 

Afterwards. I was so tired that I decided to forgo mowing the lawn itself. The main grass was only as tall as toddler not using growth enhancers. 

After I cleaned up, I headed out to my garage where the ol' Jeep is kept. I slid open the barn door (it's barn-turned-three-car-garage) and there found my Jeep. She look stunning after having been freshly rebuilt. I had been looking forward to driving with the top off ever since I bought the ol' booger.

After some conniving with the bolts and Allen keys, I slid the top off and drove out. My oh my she was fantastic! I spent the weekend joyriding and being an obnoxious fool with her. 

Well, I came home late Sunday night-say around 10pm. I was looking forward to hopping in bed and sleeping till work the next day. Only one thing lay between me and my bed, the hard top. It had to be put back on my Jeep. 

Now for context, I am a 20 something dude living alone in the middle of nowhere. I got no cell service at my house and no internet.  

Back to the story. I tried putting the top on the Jeep to no avail. I was stuck in my barn for three hours before saying, ""Fuck it. I'm out."" I just about broke my back and didn't want to strain myself for work in the morning.

Well, on the next day I woke up. I felt pretty froggy but scared of the weather forecast. It was supposed to rain all day. I bet you can't guess what the weather did!

...it rained... all day...

Luckily, I came prepared and brought a tarp with me to cover the open Jeep. It worked mighty well till it came time to take it off. Water had collected in the tarp and spilled into my Jeep when I took it off. Let me tell you what! The water landed right in my driver's seat.

So I got to drive around and show up to restaurants and whatnot with a wet ass. It was GLORIOUS. 

So yes, today I fucked up.

I'm just glad my electronics still work.

tifu,"This didn’t happen today, but yesterday, which also happened to be my 22nd birthday. No alcohol was involved which, honestly, just makes this worse. 

So for context, I ride a motorcycle to work every day. I put everything away in its place at the end of each day in their respective places, but this week was rather long and I neglected to do that, which included my heavily reinforced motorcycle boots that I left by my bedroom door. 

I was alone Sunday night (my birthday) as my family had decided to go camping, but it was honestly too cold for me and I decided to stay home. I walked into my bedroom to get something and as I walked out into my living room I stubbed my toe on the door. 

I thought. 

I heard a crack as my foot connected to what I thought was my door and I promptly fell to the ground like a bag of shit. One of my boots was wedged between the side of the door, the floor, and the other boot, which didn’t allow for any movement and it was like kicking a concrete wall with my bare foot. I was in AGONY, but it didn’t hurt ‘that much’ so after the pain subsided I left it at that. I was in pain for a good 3 hours and called my mother, who was a nurse, to get her advice. She suggested to ice it and wait for her to get back in the morning. Except that hurt even more, and I felt a burning sensation when I pulled my toe to the side but nothing looked out of place, so I went to bed. 

We went to get X-rays this morning and my suspicions were confirmed: I broke my pinky toe. Except, there’s nothing you can do to fix it except tape it to the other, not broken, toe and wait for it to heal for six weeks. I work in a workshop environment and I have been booked off work for at least a week.  I am also unable to reach my boss and tell him what is going on, so he will have an interesting text when he turns his phone on in the morning. 

Listen to your mother, kids. Just put your shit away.

tifu,"So a couple of months ago i digitilized all of my old homevideos (where i was like 10-12) and my siblings (1-3 and 9-11) homevideos. I got the google one package and uploaded like nearly 200 videos of us to google photos. It was fun to once in a while watch one of the videos and laugh about the crazy childhood we had. Fast Foward to yesterday... I found out you can upload your google photos videos directly inside youtube without uploading them once again from my computer and using all the bandwith of my connection. It went pretty fine, i selected all of the videos and let youtube handle the rest. Fast forward to 6 hours later. I was watching the first videos from the youtube app and it felt amazing, now i could watch this homevideos with my friends and family while sitting in front of my smart tv over the youtube app. 

PewdiePie uploaded a new video!!!! 

Ok let's check that out!

""Access to youtube denied"" (had to translate from german, so it is not 100% accurate)



I checked my mails because i had this feeling that it has something to do with the homevideos. I got 20 strikes from youtube in a 5 minute window where they tell me that the videos i'm uploading are flagged for child abuse or child porn or something like that. (Can't translate from german without it getting to big)

Now i'm sitting here desperatly and can't watch youtube because some of the Videos contained me and my siblings in the bathtube and putting clothes on on my new born sister. :(

tifu,"Title pretty much says it all. Just received my 2nd year law results and I have only managed to pass 2 of them. Hoping to get some advice, suggestions and positive vibes.

A little background. Did my first year in a smaller, lower tier university and through the school transferred to a better university in the UK. I will then be finishing my 2nd and final year at this new university. The 2nd year and third year will contribute 33.3% and 66.6% of my honours respectively, 

Accumulating factors of laziness, procrastination, unhealthy sleep problems,  seasonal depression and extreme stress (to the point of mild but constant suicidal thoughts) during assignment and exam time led me to perform horribly during both semesters. I admit a lot of this could have been mitigated if I had just put more work into my studies, but I thought I could coast through as I did when I was younger in primary and secondary school. I placed more emphasis on extra-curriculars rather than hit the books. I procrastinated till three days before my assignments before pulling together sub-par essays. I know I dug my own grave and now I must lie in it, but I'm hoping to find ways to climb out.

I have passed my Equity assignment and it's exam, passed my Property law assignment (100% coursework), failed my Tort assignment which was 100% coursework, failed my Land law exam (100% exam) and due to not handing in my EU law essay failed the joint EU and Internal Market exam due to the school calculating it with the average (I passed the exam but the 60% wasn't enough to average the 0%). 

I will have to do the resit exams for all the modules I have failed but the marks will be capped at a pass (40%).

Going forward, I am very upset thinking about my third year, knowing that most if not all employers only take students with 2:1 and higher. I am too upset (and frankly too poor at Maths) to calculate how much I will need in my last year to achieve this, but even I know that they will all be very high and demanding. 

It would help me greatly if I could get some advice on how to handle the year moving forward. If there is anyone who was in a similar situation I would love to know how you turned it around. 

How to actually study, how to break the news to my parents, how to play down the grades or improve other aspects of my CV for future employers or schools. 

Is there any point in continuing this degree or life anymore?

TL;DR: Failed 4/6 of my 2nd year Law modules, leaving the future of my degree and life hanging by a thread

tifu,"Well this FU happened last week.

So a bit of background story on this is I broke up with this girl, well let's call her Jane, a year ago. It was a peaceful and sort of mutual one so no hard feelings. We only met like once to close things up and afterwards when I tried to contact her after the break up she blocked me on Telegram as we used to use Telegram to message. She also blocked me from seeing her facebook updates and stuff so yea, I know nothing on what is happening to her.

&amp;#x200B;

So comes this year, it was approaching Jane's birthday and well I thought, it will be good to send her a card as just sending a message through messenger or stuff is just mediocre and I wanted to sort of try to reconnect with her and start a conversation or so. So I went ahead to get the birthday card. It was a cute teddy bear with fireworks and cake on the front and I could write message in it. The idea was perfect. ""Jane always loved to receive cards and well now you get to receive another one on your birthday. Isn't it just great?"" This is what I thought to myself and I convinced myself this is an awesome idea and I will go ahead with it. But here comes the problem. We have not been in contact and I don't remember the exact address where I can go and mail it over. But no fear, I know physically where she stays so I can just drop it by her house right? So she will still be able to receive the card on her birthday.

&amp;#x200B;

So I got everything prepared and wrote the card and messages and comes the birthday day where I will need to travel down to her house to drop the card. I specially woke up early to avoid morning crowd and I did not want to meet any of her family in case things get awkward. It was a 40 minute bus ride away and so I dropped the card at her house and left afterwards. I thought maybe after she read the card she may decide to contact me afterwards? Who knows right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Well one day past and I didn't received any message and so I thought guess she doesn't want to talk to me still. Then I brought this up to a friend of mine and my friend goes like ""woah dude what are you doing? Girls are afraid of shits like these"" Then when I reconsider it and it hit me. Oh dear lord what have I done? I sent a card and now she knows I've been to her house without people knowing. It just sound like what a stalker will do and as a girl, you will definitely be wary as this ex-boyfriend of yours sent you a card to your doorstep. Then i realise my FU and I went to check on her and found out that she blocked me off all social media and deleted off friend's list. Guess we're not friends anymore.

I am a Hong Kong citizen and if you happen to be a global news reader, you may learn that Hong Kong had a massive demonstration with over 1 million participated yesterday to fight against the extradition law.

tifu,"Well. This is a first for me. I've never posted here and I've also never missed a flight in my life. I was meant to fly from London to Krakow, Poland today at 9 am which was about 2 hours ago (at the time of writing this). I was gonna see Tool live for the first time. I waited for this day for months. The problem is I can't even afford to buy another plane ticket. I was almost at the gate too. Fuck me. This is all my fault.

I've been waiting to see Tool since I fell in love with them in 2015. So yeah, I'm a relatively new fan compared to others who waited 13 years (for those in Europe). I was looking forward to this so much. They're my favorite band.... I hate myself.

I'm sorry. I just felt like sharing and venting. I'm so disappointed and tired. I bought my ticket to see them, front row! I went all out. This is what I get for not being responsible and saving money for a rainy day AND for not being on time... Time to go back home.

tifu,"Trying this post again, also posted it to another related sub to get their feedback. 

Started when a friend helped me get a pretty good job with good pay. He's like ""You'll start as a temp and we don't drug test temps but after 6 months you should be clean to get hired directly"".

I thought cool, did the interview then I get a congratulations call and emails to links with paperwork.

Clicking through the background check authorization I see ""Drug screening, must agree or not qualified for job, submit sample within 3 business days yadda yadda"" crap and I was like aw fuck. I had been smoking pretty regularly and was actually pretty high right as I was looking at those emails, so not only am I freaking out about that but my high is getting ruined.

So I just sort of stop filling out the online forms and I start getting emails from the temp agency like ""Yo, where are these forms."" I told them I was doing some surprise assignments for my other job (sub clerical at school district, limited hours) but I'll get right on it.

Finally submit all the crap by Thursday and I see they need the sample by end of monday(the lab near me only does drug screenings M-F 1:30PM to 3:30PM so yeah...)

Had a few options: Use cousins piss who doesn't smoke, that water flush plus taking vitamin B's and creatine sup, or this synth piss my friend gave me. I was like I guess the fake piss is easier so Monday I'll do that.

Did the test just now and I started suspecting I fucked up when I poured out the fake piss into the cup they gave me and it had weird flecks in it, like dead seamonkeys or some bullshit. I'm starting to question my life choices, like why I didn't look up if fake piss expires before using it etc,

So I'm like I use this or my own piss... this or my own piss.... this or my own piss. I use this synth crap, just shake it up vigorously and maybe the crap will break up a bit? ... shit that's making a lot of noise... pour it out again... didn't work but oh well. I hear a knock on the door ""u/imapeeinyourapeein?"" and just open the door, submit the sample, sign a bunch of forms and leave.

In my car I start googling about the synth piss like it's going to make anything better. I don't find anything about crap floating in the piss so I'm still not quite sure if that's normal but I did see comments about the piss expiring after about a year (not sure about the kit given to me but it's likely it was that old. No info about that in the kit). Read that they come out with new formulas as test companies keep detecting synthetic urine. Again, no mention of this in the kit or instructions.

So yeah this could've been avoided with some research and my cousin's piss, which would've been the easiest thing. Besides the limited hours I've gotten from my current sub job I really needed this job, damn.

Oof, my bills. Thinking I should start applying for other jobs now.

fuck up time: so we go to kohl’s because she said they should carry the same brand. we get there and riffle through the undergarments section, only to find they sell literally only granny panties. after much anguish, we decide to go check other stores that sell multiple sets of underwear such as target, and jcpenny. no luck with either so we just decide to go to a victoria’s secret. we see they’re having a sale so she finds a pair that closely resemble the shredded ones, it has all the criteria she wants and i take it to the counter. now, i paid for it with *my card* instead of cash. so we get the panties and leave, suspecting nothing at the time. later that night, my dad bursts into my room while we’re playing minecraft. “i need to speak with you” he says to me, sounding quite upset. i’m confused as to why so i go down with him. he shows me his laptop screen which has my bank account pulled up on it. on the top transaction is says: DEBIT PURCHASE VICTORI... 

*shit* i told him that there was nothing bad i bought and he asks me what i bought. i finally give in and say “a thong.” he asks me why, and i told him the real reason as to why we bought a thong. *i know y’all gonna say “WhY dIdN’t yOu JuSt LiE?” and it was cause i was caught in the heat of the moment and usually i tel the truth. has been this way since i was a little kid and my friends and i would get in trouble at recess.* so now my father is very red in the face and yells at me for what he correctly assumes us to be doing. i tell him i’m not a kid anymore, i’m legally an adult and i can do what i please and he tells me to get out of the house.

It's that time in the summer where canker worms just float around the sidewalks, waiting to crawl on people's bodies like the creepy ugly things they are (no offense to canker lovers). And today, I probably had more than 15 canker worms land on me. And when those things land on you, you either squish them or flick them. 

I went to my friend's house after biking and not surprisingly, I had canker worms all over my shirt that I did not see or know about. We sit and chill and watch movies and all of a sudden, I felt this crawling sensation inside my shirt. Of course it was a canker worm. I splat the hell out of it with my hand and it left this ooze along with a dead insect kind of smell on my hand. So I went into the kitchen to wash my hand.

So I grab this transparent bottle with yellowish fluid in it. To my surprise, it didn't have a hole or sort of dispenser where you could, you know, squish the soap out of. So I just took off the lid and lathered that to my hands. I notice that there's no bubbling sensation and as I rubbed my hands more, the more it felt burned. And then I finally realized that it was bleach 'cause I kept pouring it to my hands 'cause I thought it just didn't have enough, and that's when I, the fucking idiot, just noticed the smell.

Also, in my dumb defense, it was the only thing by the kitchen sink so I just assumed it was the soap.

I didn’t check the expiry date because, well, it’s chocolate powder that stuff lasts for a couple years, right? True but as I’ve just checked the date it turns out those couple years ended 3 months ago.

So I chugged down my first mug and felt a few solid bits, I just assumed it was hardened chocolate powder since even though I didn’t know it was expired, I knew it was old and that happens sometimes. Drinking the second mug i take out a couple of the hard bits I feel and, surprise surprise, they’re white. For some reason I don’t find this strange and simply put them in a tissue and keep drinking. Yeah, I’m an idiot.

Halfway through the second mug I take another one out and wipe away the bits of chocolate powder and see its curled in that bean-like shape and has those exoskeleton lines all insects and you know what’s a white insect?You’ve guessed it, maggots.

So few hours ago I've asked my wife how she was doing (she should have been on her way home from work) and she replied something along the line ""someone from the bank just called and they said someone tried to steal money from my account so I'm trying to deal with that"" and instead of immediately calling her back to get to know what was happening I told her ""omg wtf, how's that"" and that is everything I did.

Half an hour later she writes me back ""I don't know I'm panicking money are gone I can't get it back"" and at his point we talk with her, and she tells me how someone called her, told they were ""from the bank"" and told her that there were few suspicious operations and she should confirm the data with here, and at some point they ask her to tell the numbers that were sent to her in sms (as some ""verification"" procedure) - and later on they tell her about her other account in another bank, so she gets suspicious as why would one bank know about others bank accounts and everything - but they shrug it off with some bullcrap ""we have special interbank system"" and she buys it - and gives them confirmation numbers for what actually was money transfer operation - so basically she transferred all her money to some assholes from two bank accounts.

You'd ask, why it is I who fucked up? Well, because it is an obvious scam, and I know it as soon as she told me, but at this point it was too late - If I had called her IMMEDIATELY as I read her message - I'd tell her not to do anything stupid, to call to the bank on her own, and block her cards. Instead, I did nothing, waiting for her to deal with the situation. And even worse - I've worked in a bank in the past - so I know exactly the procedures, and I know exactly they won't return her money.  
On my defense - we had some very heated up arguments, when I called her at inconvenient time - and few times when I called her when she was on the road. Still - it was a fuck up on my part, instead of trying to care for her, I just let her deal with it.

I had done my training and was changing back into my normal clothes and its been kinda cold so I had brought my running shoes to switch back into. They're also super easy to wear if your feet are kinda wet so I was like hey ima wear them. Anyways, I had put all ma clothes on and was putting my shoes and socks on. I had the right one on and was desperately searching through my bag for the left one. I remember thinking very clearly, oh shit.

My fucking left shoe is chilling in the corner and I' like BROOOO.

tifu,"So this happened a couple days ago.  I woke up from a long nap after I had had a fight with my wife.  I nap afterwards, ya see.  So it happened at 10 am, woke up at 6 pm same day.  Go downstairs.  Second fight breaks out.  She says I am on my phone too much when I spend time with our young son.  True I was playing a game, but it wasn't the intense kind that you have to pay attention to.  Just hit a button every few minutes.  I argue this point and she is having none of it.  

&amp;#x200B;

Says I need to put my phone down for 30 minutes when I'm with him.  I get angry, I work 60 hours a week, don't I get some time?  She reminds me that I stay up late and am playing games for 3 hours a night.  Not that it matters, baby is asleep by the time I get home.  I go into a rage BUT I DON'T BREAK ANYTHING EXPENSIVE, which is what I generally do.  I control myself enough to make it downstairs.  I smash a walking crutch against the stone wall, breaking it.

&amp;#x200B;

She chases after me once she hears something break.  It is established that she is not to come into the basement after we have fought, because bad things happen.  She blames my anger on the fact that I took my pills (Lithium and some other one) late a few times the previous week.  Not that I missed taking them, but I was a few hours late.  She loves pointing this out, any time I get upset she says it.

&amp;#x200B;

I rush upstairs.  She runs away thinking I am chasing after her.  I go to my Lithium pills and I take the rest that I have, 7 or 8 dosses.  She calls 911, the send over the police and an ambulance.  I am taken against my will to the local hospital and am kept in the ER overnight.  The wife and I keep in contact throughout the night.  I am very upset that she followed me into the basement.  I am very upset that she had me taken away to the hospital.  

&amp;#x200B;

She picks me up the next day.  She drops me off at our house and leaves.  I cannot stay here anymore.  She has found me an apartment.  She says I can see my son whenever I want, but that won't be true.  I feel empty.  He was the only thing keeping me together.  I put all his pictures face down.  I cannot look at him.  I don't feel much like living.

tifu,"Throwaway account. I'm writing this on my lunch break on mobile, apologies for any typos and weird formatting. This did indeed happen today, after I arrived to work.

Backstory is my husband and I had a fun weekend out of town where we met up with a friend of ours and had a threesome. So I come back to work this Monday morning grinning ear-to-ear like an idiot and listening to dirty music on my headphones all day to relish in the memories of the weekend, alone in my dirty thoughts, except for today it wasn't entirely alone.

This TIFU is brought to you by me being completely oblivious to my surroundings. I use YouTube to listen to music so that I can control which song plays next. So usually I'll have YouTube open on my phone, with my phone face down on my desk. Most of the songs on the playlist I was listening to didn't have music videos, they were mainly lyric videos or album covers except for one or two (phone isn't connected to work wi-fi in case you were wondering).

The receptionist came into my office to ask a question, and I took my earbuds out to answer her. She needed help figuring out how to do something on Google Drive, so I invited her to sit down next to me at my desk so that I could use my desktop to show her how to do it. After several minutes, I look down and realize that my phone is face-up. The women from ""Earned It"" by The Weeknd have been dancing naked on my phone, bending over one another with whips in their hands and big black Xs on their tits and asses. I quickly lock the screen, but the receptionist's face was 12 inches from my phone the entire time. It occured to me that I had just used my phone right before my co-worker walked in and forgot to put it face-down again. So today I may have showed her a lot more than how to troubleshoot Google Drive.

I was distracted and my dumbass didn't think about it because I mainly use YouTube for the purpose of listening to music or podcasts and forget sometimes that the visual component is there. She hasn't said a word to me about it. The receptionist is fairly religious, and serves as the president of a local Christian organization in our community in her spare time. So... yeah, we'll see what happens to my employment status. Here's to hoping the receptionist was just as painfully oblivious as me. If not, best case scenario she just prays for my heathen soul and tells no one.

I would like there to be some sort of lesson in all of this, but I'm going to assume that most of you are already smart enough to use Spotify or another app for these purposes... or do your dirty post-coital bliss rituals at home where people can't see you.

tifu,"Obligatory this happened yesterday and not today. TL;DR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I had met this girl on Tinder that I was really stoked about, we had already met face to face one time and this time she came over to my place for a nice meal and some ""Netflix and Chill"".

&amp;#x200B;

We're on the couch, just making out and stuff, things get heated and we go to my room.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I live in an apartment in a densely populated area, and my room is not very big, I barely have any space for my small bed, my pc, and my closet, and my desk is just beside my bed.

&amp;#x200B;

On the desk, there was my grades report for the year, which I had to have signed by my parents and I must give back to my counselor at school. I didn't think much of this because I like to keep things visible so that I won't forget to have my mother sign it.

&amp;#x200B;

And then the sexy time comes along. I won't go into much detail, but this girl told me beforehand that she is a squirter, but that she had never known any person other than herself capable of making her squirt, and I really, really like me some squirt, so I was trying really hard to get her to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

And, well, it happens. And not one, but twice she squirted all over me and my bed (I was enjoying it lots, of course), but a lot, and I mean, a lot of the liquids also ended up on the desk, and, of course, on my grades report as well.

&amp;#x200B;

And the smart, responsible person that I am didn't even think of that and just kept going, blinded by unbearable lust.

&amp;#x200B;

When we stopped, and I took a look at the desk, my grades where not only soaking wet in whatever squirt is made out of, but there were also three used condoms just casually laying on it (fortunately those had not any genetic material on them) and a used up bottle of crappy lube, which made a delightful concoction along with my to-be-handed-in grades report.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that I haven't even got my mothers signature on it yet, and I don't know how in hell I am going to be able to do so. Advice on cleaning a sheet of fancy paper so that it doesn't reek would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, this woman is on Reddit, so I really hope she doesn't find this. lol.

tifu,"My husband’s birthday was last week, unfortunately timed during a rare visit from my father and so didn’t get the attention it deserved. “No matter,” I tell myself. “Dad leaves Saturday, I’ll bake a cake Sunday, no problem.” I should preface this by saying I am not a baking person, I’m a cooking person. I’ll make you slide-off-the-bone roasts and perfectly crisp quiche any day, but I never enjoyed sweet things.

So I look up the recipe, basic simple sponge cake, and get to work. I’m a little odd so of course I use food dye to turn the cake red. And then I chuck it in the oven and get to work on lemon syrup, whipped cream and icing. Firstly the lemon syrup is way runnier than I expected. Then the cream whips so stiff I almost can’t pull the mixer out of it. Thankfully, the icing seems fine, just whipped butter, icing sugar and blue food dye.

So first I pull the cake out of the oven and everything seems fine. It’s risen, blood-red and smells right. Then I get to work decorating it, and everything goes to shit faster than I can believe. I didn’t let the cake cool (I mentioned I don’t bake, right?) and I had only skimmed the recipe because it had one of those six-page-long stories before the actual recipe about how the author feels standing in the autumn rain or some shit.

Long story short, EVERYTHING melts. Everything. The cream, the icing, even somehow the lemon syrup. This cake is trying so hard to soak it all up, but alas, in vain. The plate the cake is resting on quickly overflows. Blue icing and transparent cream are in free fall over the edge of the bench. And a sink hole appears to have formed in the blood colored cake, allowing yet another avenue for the icing to escape.

I manage to mutter “oh noooooo” and then start breathlessly laughing as the situation escapes me and the paper towels. Unfortunately, breathless laughter sounds a lot like crying sometimes. My husband only hears “oh no” and then heavy breathing from the other room and promptly panics, his worst fears of me taking off my fingers with a knife playing through his mind. He rushes in to find me giggling like a loon as our bench is engulfed in blue.

Ever kind and compassionate, my husband says it’s the thought that counts and bravely takes a slice. We both know this cake isn’t worthy of candles. 

He didn’t finish his piece. He couldn’t. How did I fuck up “Basic Simple Sponge Cake?” I have no idea, but this thing looked like a hunk of raw orc flesh, I shit you not. This slice of cake looked like a mutant watermelon who’d just been shot with its own seeds out of a tommy gun. This was supposed to be a slightly quirky token of affection to my husband for his birthday and instead looked like a death threat half a step down from leaving a horse’s head in his bed.

Despite it all, he said thank you and that he loves me. I’m a little concerned.

If you want to see pics of this monstrosity you’ll need to direct me to instructions on how to post them here, I’m not good at phones.

TL;DR: the cake I baked for my husband’s birthday both looked and tasted like exotic roadkill.

tifu,"It was my friend's 18th birthday this week, so we thought to surprise him with a surprise party. One of the activities we set up was a giant-ass slip-n-slide.

So, here we are at the party and enjoying ourselves, 5 of us decided to wrestle in the soapy puddle at the end of the whole contraption. Being wet and all, we accumulated quite a bit of grime and proceeded indoors to shower.

With the large number of people soaked with soap, dirt, and grass, by the time us 5 got inside both the upstairs and the downstairs showers were occupied. Not deterred, we waited patiently and slowly began to freeze.

I guess the cold must've killed off our brain cells, because by the time the downstairs shower was freed up all of us decided to squeeze into it in hopes of getting warm. 5 grown-ass men, in a shower designed for one.

At first, things went well. We were reasonably maneuverable and the soap from the slip-n-slide helped wonders. During the whole commotion, we decided to rotate as one homogenous mass in the shower. We locked into position, five men in a circle, and commenced rotation.

Somehow we popped the entire shower enclosure off its frame. Clean off.

Naturally, we got a little paranoid. As a final testament of our lack of brain capacity, we decided to have one person shower at a time. Thankfully, I was the first one in. The other four held up the frame from outside.

One of the glass panes came tumbling down outwards, falling on two people, completely shattering, and covering the whole bathroom floor with glass.

One person got a chunk of flesh sliced off leg, one got sliced eyebrow, the rest of us looked like were crusted with diamonds.

In the end, while we stood awkwardly half-naked in and out of the shower, somebody got a vacuum and gradually dug us out. Emergency room was attended to.

TLDR: Five guys showered together, didn't quite work out and injury was sustained.

This happened a few months ago, but my boyfriend reminded me yesterday that this even occurred. 

My family and I went on vacation in SoCal in March, and my boyfriend tagged along for the ride. 

We all decided one day to go to see Captain Marvel. My whole family loves the MCU and from what I'm told, it was a great experience for everybody... 
I wouldn't know myself, seeing as I was so fucked up on edibles I couldn't see straight. 

BF and I live in a medicinal marijuana state, but it's not in effect yet, and we smoke on a daily basis.  My dumbass in California thought, ""Oh, I can handle 5, 10g gummies. I smoke all the time, no biggie. ""  And at lunch before we go to the movie theater, I downed them all in one go. 

Once we sat down in the theater, I was feeling great, relaxed, no issues. The moment the lights went down, and the movie started, I felt like I was on a rollercoaster. I was nauseous from all the action on the screen, and all I could really gather was there was lots of noise , and lots of vivid colors.  I proceeded to stumble out of the room, and throw up in the trash next to the doors. 
Returned to my seat, eyes closed, and waited. 
When I got home, I layed down and napped for 3 hours. 

To this day, I don't remember the movie.  I honest to God couldn't tell you the fuckin plot of Captain Marvel.

I was browsing Reddit earlier, looking for memes to send to my friends, and I stumbled across this one: https://imgur.com/gallery/PB9W3GV I don't know what prompted me to send it as it is not a very good meme but anyways I did.

For some background, I have a co-worker friend who's brother has a disease that makes his blood really thin, and if he starts bleeding, it could be fatal. Now I apologise, I'm not very knowledgeable about the disease or what medication he is on or anything. But basically the brother had gotten sick and needed an emergency surgery. The doctors said there was a very very low chance that he would live through it due to the possibility of him bleeding out.

Now my dumbass completely forgot all about this and decided to send my coworker the meme I linked above. We frequently sent each other memes, so this was nothing out of the ordinary. After I sent it, I saw he viewed it and didn't respond. Then in a rush I remembered his brother and I was about to apologise for it and saw that he blocked me on both Instagram and Snapchat, which are the only communications I have with him. I haven't seen him at work yet and I'm about to go on vacation so I won't see him for three weeks. I have no idea what to do next.

This actually happen today. I am away for a vacation with a group of friends. ONE of them is my crush.

I decided to take a nap while everyone is on the deck that’s off the beach and playing cards. When I sleep my arms and legs fall asleep very easily if I sleep on them weird. So when I woke up I had to pee super bad but my leg was asleep, so I awkwardly walk on it as I feel like I’m falling over all the way to the toilet. No one realized I was awake. When I sit on the toilet my leg starts to wake up. Everyone calls it something different but I call it “tickle mode” when it starts to tingle and kind of hurts but makes you laugh. (I’m hoping this isn’t just me and SOMEONE knows the feeling im talking about) When I was wiping I start kind of laughing and lean my head back and lift my leg up because it is tingling. And right at the most awkward time ever as my hand is in between my crotch and I’m making weird noises and leaning back my CRUSH walks into the bathroom!!! And kind of goes “oh?” In a weirded out way and starts laughing then proceeds to shut the door! I was so embarassed because I knew how it looked! While I’m sitting there finishing up I can hear him out in the hall way say “I think she’s masturbating???”

tifu,"Note: This incident happend around 8 years ago when I was in fifth grade, also I'm on mobile so excuse any spelling errors/formating mistakes.

Context: Starting in the fifth grade, every year the school district would host an annual ski trip at a nearby ski resort. This place was legit, it had over 30 trails that ranged from beginner to pro.

Our bus pulled up to the resort and we are told that if you have never skied/snowboarded before we would need to take a lesson before being allowed to go on the lifts. These lessons were held on a bunny hill. (a really, really easy, short, straight, and not steep hill) We are all taught basic techniques like how to go, stop, and turn. At the end of lessons we all take a test to see if we won't die if we move more than 12 fucking feet. I barely pass that test.

That is where I made the first mistake.

I get my pass to go on the lifts and 10 year old me thinks ""Im going to go to the top of the goddamn mountain""

I take the lift up, WAY up, and get off, I see around 5 slopes. I see one marked ""Double Black Diamond"" (for those who dont know, thats as hard as it gets) I decide to peek over the edge to see what it looks like. Sure enough, its really fucking steep with trees, ramps, obstacles and fuck up magnets everywhere.

That was when I lost my grip and the shit hit the fan.

I started to gain speed, alot of speed, so I did what I was taught and put my skies in a V position to try to slow down.

Bad. Mistake.

You see, when you do this at THAT kind of speed, you tend to lose control of basically everything. When I lost control I swerved and skidded and my natural reflexes told me to crouch to the ground and cover my face. 

I dont know if you guys ever tried to do this on skies, but when I tried I fucking turned hard to the right.

You will never believe what was to my right guys, yep, it was a goddamn tree. I turned my face just in time and got all the impact on the side of my face and chest, luckily I managed to slow down some and didnt break every bone in my body.

I got up and my face hurt like hell, I reached up to touch the side of my face and something felt odd, my jaw was fucked up, and when I say fucked up, I mean it. It was completely unhinged and fractured. I was in so much pain that I could barely think, thats when my vision went to black. [Mind exits stage left...]

I wake up a few minutes later on a streacher in the lobby of the lounge on a stretcher being loaded into an ambulance. I dont really remember what happened after this because I was jacked up on pain medicine but I was told in the hospital they had to reallocate my jaw and help fix the fracture.

I still ski to this day, and try not to hit trees on my way down. My jaw is very loose and can be moved in weird ways. I still bring up this story for a good laugh with the friends occasionally and I hope you like to laugh at my pain as much as we do, thanks for reading and dont slip down sloped and hit trees.

I met a girl on the app and she was probably about 20 years old, and she seemed really laid back and had a dark sense of humor like me. I was about 22 at the time, and it's important to note here that I am a woman. 

We went on an intimate brunch date, which was probably our 4th or 5th date. She seemed super into me and so we both got a little relaxed and started to share some personal stories. She told me a very emotional story about when she was in high school she got pregnant and had to get an abortion. I don't remember the entire story but the mood definitely got quite heavy so I decided to make a lighthearted joke. 

Here's the fuck up.

I’ve had had thousands of messages asking for an update, and a similar amount of messages asking for the pictures (I don’t have them and I don’t want to see them again).

The truth is there isn’t much of an update because I never confronted her about it. I decided that it was my problem not hers, and that this may be one of those rare occasions where it would be more healthy for our relationship to leave the past in the past.

Our sex life is back to normal and I feel like I’ve mostly processed the situation in a healthy way. We all have things in our past, and the most important thing is we are happy and we love each other.

WHY DOES SHE STILL HAVE THE PICTURES?

Honestly I think she probably forgot. We all have stuff on our phones going back years. I found some nudes of exes that I had forgotten about so I guess I’m as bad as her.

HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS HER EX?

Because I could see a gallery of thumbnails from the same set and some had his face in

WAS IT PHOTOSHOPPED OR A STRAP-ON?

No

YOU MUST BE EXAGGERATING NO DICK IS THAT BIG

2 coke cans is about right. It was bigger than her forearm.

As you can imagine, I’ve also received a bunch of dick pics in my DMs with guys comparing their dicks to 2 coke cans. Thanks for that chaps.  

A DICK THAT BIG COULDN’T GET HARD

It certainly seemed rock hard in the pictures, but she had previously mentioned that an ex had erection problems and relied on viagra. So maybe you’re right.

HER PUSSY MUST BE STRETCHED/CAVERNOUS/GAPING

She probably has the tightest vagina of all the girls I’ve been with. I guess you don’t know how vaginas work.

The 4 receptions greeted us robotically and asked us to sign in. They handed us pamphlets and we had to put our name, phone number, email, address, reasons how we have heard of the religion and why we are interested. I made sure to put one letter or number off for everything because I was creeped the fuck out. Then when I tried to flip the page I realized that they carbon copied the paper I wrote on. They looked at our shit we wrote down and started questioning all of it and asking us personal questions to try and see if we were lying.

out of there.

I was hanging out at my mom’s house when my grandma decided she wanted Chinese takeout. I don’t have a car of my own but often borrow my mom’s which she has no problem with. For reference she drives a ‘16 Malibu that has the fancy touch screen and USB ports and such on the dash.

I put in the order, waited the 25 minutes, and I hopped in the car. My younger sister decided to tag along for the ride. 

Earlier on the touchscreen I had noticed an option called projection and thought maybe you could play YouTube videos or something. She decided to plug in her phone and try it out, but an option called apple car play popped up instead. We were still in the driveway at this point.

So on this Apple Car Play you could access several options, one of which was open your messages to send voice messages. I was joking around and decided to send myself a message as I’m pulling out of the driveway. Then I decided to click on a random group chat she had going with some people she didn’t know that well and send a voice message saying “HEY ALL YOU SEXY PEOPLE” just to mess with her. 

As I’m talking to Siri I stupidly take my eyes off the road. My sister was frantically trying to prevent the message from sending and wasn’t paying attention either. Next thing we know we hear a loud crash, feel some jilting, and a mailbox go flying through the air. 

In my stupidity of trying to be an annoying sister, I ran slightly off the road and completely knocked down the neighbors mailbox. We weren’t going more then 20 mph so thankfully no one was injured. I wasn’t really sure what to do, so I pulled into a neighboring lot and turned back around to go apologize and check out the damage.

The  lady’s mailbox had broken at the base, been completely uprooted, and the post was just lying splintered on the ground. Several pieces were strewn all over her yard and the guy next door was just watching it all from his front porch in disdain. 

As I was pulling in her driveway, the lady came out of her house and I was internally panicking. I saw she had her phone up to her ear and thought she was calling the police. I got out of the car and approached her, she said she was calling her landlady and my sister ran back down the street to go get my mom, all the while I was profusely apologizing. 

She couldn’t get ahold of the landlady so we decided to just exchange information and I’d cover the cost of the new mailbox. Not sure how much it’s gonna cost yet since it was late evening when this occurred, but I’m thinking around $70-150 depending on how fancy they go. 

Surprisingly my mom wasn’t upset. My grandma did eventually get her shrimp fried rice and my moms car wasn’t too damaged other than the front bumper being a little bent and a few small scuffs, but now I’m on the hook for a new mailbox for not paying enough attention to the road.

So I was at the McDonald’s drive thru around 2am to get my fat ass a Big Mac. There’s maybe 6 other cars in line and it’s moving pretty slow, so I look down at my vape and start hitting away because of how bored I am. 

So I order my food, blow fat ass vape cloud out the window. Pull up to the pay window, blow fat ass vape cloud out the window,

Now I came to the second window where you get your food. Nothing. Nobody is standing at the window, but it’s wide fucking open. So I do what I’ve been doing for the past 15 minutes or so and I blow a colossally huge vape cloud straight out infront of me 

I had both my windows rolled down. The second I blew said cloud, the wind picked up and said colossally huge vape cloud got sucked STRAIGHT INTO McDonald’s through the open window. Not even a whole 10 seconds later, I hear a loud “BEEP BEEP BEEP” and it instantly hit me that my colossally huge vape cloud which entered McDonald’s had set off the fire alarm.

tifu,"Didn't happen today but I still cringe to this day when i think about it

Got on a tram near my college, and the tram was completely packed. Way too many people crammed on. Anyway, a bunch of people get on and so we are all shuffling aroudn to make space. Once we're all settling down, I move my arm from in front of me and reach up and back behind me to grab a hand strap. All of a sudden a baby starts bawling its eyes out. I look behind me, and a guy is standing right behind me with a baby in a little pouch thing strapped to his chest. I look back ahead, then realise over the next 10 seconds that... well.. I turn around again and say ""shit mate was that me?"" And he just says kind of awkwardly ""yeah you just elbowed my baby full in the face"". I obviously apologised profusely, so of course everyone who didn't see it now knows I just elbowed a baby. In the face. And now it's crying hysterically.

I then have to just stand there in silence, and basically run out of the tram on the next stop, even though it wasn't my stop. I would have been willing to elbow at least another 7 babies in their little faces while frantically pushing my way out of the crowded tram if it meant I would get to spend 2 seconds less on that tram where at least 50 people knew me as the guy that just elbowed a baby. In the face.

I just hope to god some of the other college students that knew me werent' on that tram (which usually one or two always are...)

I try to tell myself that the guy is the asshole for having a baby strapped to his chest on a tram packed to the brim. That somehow it is his fault that I elbowed a baby very hard in the face. This lie never seems to work fully though. Only to me could this sort of thing happen. At the end of the day, I think we all know who the real victim is here. (&gt;!me!&lt;)

I wonder how that baby is doing these days. He's probably about 3 now. Bless his now compacted little face, I hope he is ok.

tifu,"This is a throwaway account so people I know don’t know it is me. 

Like most TIFUs, this didn’t happen recently.

This was about a year and a half ago. I was a teenager.  I was playing Fortnite (yes I know, but this is when it was just starting off, so it wasn’t as bad as it is now) , and I was waiting for somebody to come back so I could start the next match. 

I was a horny teenager, so I decided to look up some porn. I didn’t jack off because the guy could come back at any second, and if I was close to finishing, it would be awkward. 

Now, I had an old headset(still do), and it would glitch sometimes. Sometimes my mic would get amplified for the people listening. The key problem with my headset, though, is whenever I muted my mic via the wire(there is a switch), sometimes it would transmit the sound of whatever is on my computer to my mic, making anybody that I’m in a lobby with be able to hear me.

When I was in the middle of a watching the porn, when this guy comes back, and he hears the porn. Specifically, fapping and a girl moaning. 
He says in the awkward tone, “uhhhhh, okay? Well I have to go.”
I quickly shut the porn off, realizing that I had fucked up. I still think about it sometimes, even though me and that guy don’t talk anymore.

tifu,"So this didn't start today, but it ended today. When I was in high school, I was on a dragon boat team (simultaneous rowing in a long boat). I got to practice early and I was the only one there. It was pouring down rain, but our team sucked and needed the practice so I went anyways. We practiced along the Willamette going through downtown Portland, and there are plenty of bridges in the area, so I huddled up underneath one waiting for a text that practice would be cancelled. A few minutes later, a man comes up to me with two bags of food. He handed me a bagel and said ""Don't worry, it'll get better."" I was confused, but hungry so I took the bagel. I thought he was talking about the weather getting better, so I thought nothing of it. 

Skip to today, I'm in a grocery store and a man approaches me. He said ""I'm glad you didn't have to sell your ring to get by. It must mean a lot to you.""

Extremely confused, I ask him ""What are you talking about?""

He said ""You were homeless a few years ago and I gave you food. I recognize your ring.""

At this point everything clicks together and I feel like a fucking idiot. Back in high school, I often wore clothes full of holes, so I probably did look homeless. I wear a very unique ring that my older sister made for me, so it probably is very recognizable. I said ""Oh, I was never homeless. I was just hungry."" Nice choice of words. Now I look like a greedy little shit.

He gawks at me in disbelief and says very loudly, enough to turn the heads of everyone within a 20 foot vicinity: ""You're why I never give money to homeless people!""

I'm absolutely humiliated and I 100% walked into that one because why would I think before I speak? So now I have to find another grocery store to avoid the silent judgement of any and all people who overheard that conversation.

tifu,"**Gonna use a throwaway. I'm not giving my roommate the satisfaction of sharing this stupid shit of his on my actual account.** 

I had an essay to print out this weekend but since I no longer had my own printer, rest her poor soul, it meant driving down to the print shop. So, I wasted no time copying all my shit to a USB and grabbing my coat. I was literally just about to shut the door behind me when I heard my roommate calling my damn name. He wanted something printed out as well. A fucking flyer or some shit. Random, but ok whatever. 

He asked if he could use my USB. I didn't see why not, so I said sure. Once he was done copying the file from his laptop, he gave me back my USB and said: ""Valar Morgulis, motherfucker"". I said: ""Valar Dohearis, you degenerate turd"" and bounced. The print shop was busy when I got there but the wait was worth it because the girl who came to assist me was cute as fuck. Little did I know, this would only be the beginning of my humiliating downfall.

I handed the cute print shop girl my USB with the simple instruction of printing out the two files on there. As far as I knew, there was nothing else on the USB except those two documents. Print shop girl stared at her computer screen before locking eyes again. Her expression was unreadable. Like she was trying hard not to show an emotion. She leaned in and sheepishly asked: ""Which two files, sir?"". I replied: ""Only the two you see on there"". 

At that moment she turned the computer screen towards me and revealed that there was close to a dozen folders on there. Folders that never even existed when I copied my essay. Here's the damn punchline. All these fucking folders were labeled with hardcore, homo-erotic descriptions:

**""TINY TWINK DRILLED HARD BY HANDSOME HANDYMAN""**

**""COLLEGE STUD DRAINS HIS BIG UNCUT COCK""** 

**""CUTE BOY FUCKED IN THE ASS BY DADDY""**

**""TEASING MY DRUNK STRAIGHT FRIEND WITH RAW DICK""**

**""HIGH SCHOOL HUNKS FUCK BAREBACK""** 

**""HUNG DOCTOR GETS HEAD AFTER PHYSICAL""**

**""PLANET OF THE BOTTOMS: DAWN OF DA DICK""** 

There were loads more, but I'm sure ya'll get the pornographic picture. I shook my head in horror and said: ""That ain't mine"". Print shop girl's eyes narrowed and practically penetrated my fucking soul. 

""What should I print for you, sir?"" 

""It's my roommate... he does this kinda shit""

""Of course""

I swallowed what remained of my dignity and did what had to be done. 

""Print the one called assignment, please. Under, uh... All Ass All Access. Thank you""

*Edit: Ya'll giving me too much attention. Appreciate the rewards though. Just wanna provide feedback to some of the comments. I requested that print shop girl expand the display settings to show the number of files in each folder. All the folders had 0 files except one: ""All Ass All Access"". That's how I located my essay. For the record, I'm not gonna revenge-prank my damn roommate by fucking him. Also, this throwaway isn't to hide this post from him, I just don't wanna have him think these little stunts of his are worthy of living on the Reddit account I use daily.

So today my brother and I went to go pick up my cat. I had the sudden urge to transfer the data from one of my apps to my new phone so I looked at my 5s that was in my cupholder. The screen had completely uplifted and broke the otter box case it was in and the inside was exposed. The sealed baggie thing inside the battery was super puffy. It was halfway to exploding and basically a bomb if it got any hotter.

So we take it to a metro pcs. The lady backs away from the counter when she looks at it and say ""Oh, no. Oh no we can't take that you guys have to get out of here. Just ditch it in a dumpster dude. Thats a ticking time bomb."" So we go to the fire department.

We get there and the office is closed. Call the non-emergency number and nobody answers. 

Luckily as we're walking away one of the gates is open so we call out the the fireman on the other side. He takes a look. Says he has no idea what to do. Goes to get another fireman. He comes over and says ""Yeah we can't take that its a chemical fire hazard. Try a phone store they can dispose of it."" We explain how metro pcs basically told use to gtfo. They said try AT&amp;T or verizon. So we get directions to an AT&amp;T.

I'm driving 2 miles down the road fearing this thing is gonna 'm explode in my brothers hands in the passengers seat. I speed to the AT&amp;T. We get there and its IN THE MALL. So we bring this thing into the mall and into the AT&amp;T. Same situation as the metro and the fire department, tell us to get out of their store. Tell us to go to best buy. So we go.

We get to best buy and waste no time. Ask the person at the front desk if they can help. They send us to customer service/geek squad. They back away from the counter as well. ""I don't know what to tell you man. Ditch it. We don't have anything to dispose of it with and I'm honestly uncomfortable standing next to it."" They say. We explain how we've been 3 places who couldn't help us yet including the fire department. They insist they can't do anything. ""So leave?"" We say. They nod. We leave.

The only place left is the recycling centers which are closed. We decide to ditch it in a dumpster. We drive around the back and go up to the first dumpster we see.

This happened a couple of hours ago when we got home from working a double shift together. On our way home we stopped at the gas station a block from our place and grabbed a 6-pack of our favorite beer. After getting the dogs walked and changed into our comfy pajamas, we crack open a beer and load a bowl into the bong so we can unwind from our long day and relax. As most good stoners do lol we have a cup of something to drink in case a good coughing fit brings us to tears and we need the sweet relief of a soothing liquid. Our drink of choice is a refreshing cup of cold ass water. Well, that also happens to be what we feed our lil baby bong as to keep the smooth hits coming. As the night proceeds and the couch becomes increasingly more cozy I lose interest in getting up to dump the dirty bong water into the sink to switch it with fresh ice cold water sitting on the coffee table. In my delightfully inebriated state I decide to pour the dirty water into an old beer can thinking I'm a lazy genius not having to be the fool who stands up to change the water. I guess after a couple of splashes of bong water into a beer can it'll make it feel like a half full (or empty...) beer. So after taking a particularly hearty hit my fiancée starts coughing and needs liquid relief. Being the seasoned stoner she is, knows not to grab the tiny cup of water, for it is empty and will be of no use to her, she grabs a beer. My bong water beer. She takes a full gulp and gives me this mixed look of confusion and rage, sets the can down calmly and asks, ""That wasn't beer was it?"", before moseying to the bathroom to throw it all back up.

tifu,"Like every great post on here, this didn’t happen today, but rather a few years ago. Throwaway because of obvious reasons. Posting this on mobile, so sorry for the formatting.

To start this post off, I will tell you that I genuinely do not know if I actually committed credit card fraud, there’s just no way for me to confirm or deny it and I don’t want to find out.

DISCLAIMER: FRAUD IS BAD, DON’T DO IT

Back when I was around 15 my friends and I had found this amazing site called tremorgames dot com, which let you buy steam games by doing surveys, you can also trade the currency they award you with to buy bitcoin, which was relatively cheap back then, but that’s a TIFU for another time. The games were real, I have half of my steam library thanks to the site, so naturally this was really great for a couple of kids too young to get jobs. After running out of most of the methods to get what they called tremorcoins like game-fly trials and an insurmountable number of surveys on a firm called fisher investments, my friends and I found one of the many scam tasks, only this one was worth millions of coins (about the cost of two or three big steam games) so obviously we tried to trick the system with it. The task was to buy a home security system but the price I was given wasn’t the same as the one they gave my friends. Anyways, you needed a credit card to buy it obviously, so we tried a fake credit card generator, which is meant to generate dead numbers to trick some scam sites. I input mine and typed a random security code and had a simple first success, but when my friends tried just seconds later, it didn’t accept the numbers they generated. They tried over and over again, but mine was the only one that worked. We came to the conclusion that I must have accidentally generated a real number. Again, this may be just kids being dumb and nobody was hurt, but at the time I knew for a fact that it wasn’t the case. I broke down and cried because should I be caught, I’d be arrested for sure. Sure enough, an hour later there’s a knock on the door downstairs and a man’s voice says “this is the police, open up!” I nearly shit. I got so scared, but I knew if I didn’t play it cool, I was fucked for sure. “I know what I’ll do, I’ll tell them nobody is home, no strangers allowed in, but if they do come in for some reason and they try to arrest me, I’ll run out the back and run to the front. Yeah, then I’ll hide under someone’s car until they leave. From there I’ll take some supplies and live on the lamb. Fuck, I didn’t charge my laptop, gotta ditch it.” All these thoughts of being a fugitive and stealing to survive flood my mind as I open the door and stare, pale, dumbfounded and relived. There, at the door is my brother-in-law and my sister with my nephews. Thank god, not under arrest just yet! Things basically continued like this, expecting every cop and cop car to stop and arrest me, even to this day, even though the statute of limitations on fraud has long since passed.

TL;DR: I accidentally generated a real credit card number (I think), committed fraud for some games I never play and nearly shit myself around every cop since.",TIFU by potentially committing credit card fraud
tifu,"So today has probably been the worst fuck-up I’ve ever made, and I should have seen it coming. This is a new account and you’ll see why I’ve had to abandon my main once you read my situation at the moment.  

Earlier, I made a post to reddit (Can’t tell which sub due to privacy reasons) that I didn’t think would do well, I put my phone down for a few hours and went to hang out with a friend and when I came back to my check my phone, I had  18k likes and  lots of messages, this was a huge surprise to me considering I never really had a post that got more then 5k likes. Here is my first mistake, I let my ego get ahold of me. Once saw all this attention I was getting, I went to tell my mother because she also has reddit. Long story short, she didn’t really care all too much. After I told her, I went to my sister. Worst fucking thing I could have done. When I showed her, she saw my username and told me she has reddit. I didn’t even know she knew reddit exists. Anyways, once I figure this out, my heart drops, I run upstairs to my phone and get on reddit. I start deleting personal posts and comments as fast as possible, but it’s too late, and there was too fucking many I made. I hear her yell from downstairs my username and I start getting very anxious. I was trying my best to keep deleting but I knew she had definitely already seen something  personal. 

Once she had found out, she went somewhere with my mother and I assume told her EVERYTHING (me smoking, relationships, ect) because she is a snitch. They haven’t spoken to me the rest of the day so I think they’re trying to save me embarrassment or just haven’t talked to me about it yet.

tifu,"Obligatory didn't happen today, but oddly enough I did try to post this when it happened and it didn't work and I was never motivated enough to try posting again.

So let's set the scene: it's about 1AM in the downtown area of my home town (grid system, one way streets, light rail crossings) and I was finishing up a labor job for the state I was working with my dad's company for some extra cash.

On my way home, I make a wrong turn. ""oh well, I'll just loop around and get back on track"" I say to myself, since I can count and spell well enough. I see a ""do not enter"" sign ahead because the 2-way street I'm on is about to turn into a one-way. So usually these intersections force you to turn right.

Here's where the fuckup begins:

I mindlessly turn the blind corner and very quickly feel/hear a loud THUD and screeching sound that felt like it lasted forever, but was really only a second or two. This isn't a road, but a light rail stop. The road had dropped out from under me, and my car was beached on the tracks with my wheels hovering off the ground. At this point I'm ready to cry because I've assumed my car is fucked. And now I have to figure out what to do.

So I call my dad, I had only left the job site 10 minutes ago and he has a large truck with a pneumatic winch on the front, which I knew would be very helpful. So I make the call, the conversation went roughly like this:

""dad... I'm okay, but I fucked up real bad and I need help""

""what happened?""

*I explain, shakily as one might imagine*

""how the fuck did you manage to pull a bone head move like that? What's the matter with you? Where are you? This is why you don't drive stoned!""

""I'm not stoned dad, I rolled a cigarette. I'm still smoking the same damn cigarette. But none of that matters, some people 8n a nearby parking lot have noticed and I don't want to be here alone"" (I'm female) 

""... Oh"" then some more yelling, made it really hard to even tell him where i was, and finally he shows up.

""how could you do this?! It doesn't even LOOk like a road!""

""I know dad, probably the dumbest thing I've ever done but can you help me?""

""What would you even have done if I wasn't here? ""

"" probably called my roadside assistance?""

""yeah, and they'd fuck up your car""

""probably.""

By this point a small croud has gathered on the opposite side of a chain-link fence separating the light rail stop from the adjacent parking lot (Given the hour, I assume it was a bar) they've begun to hold up their phones and start shouting at me like ""what happened?!"" or ""are you drunk?""

So we look under my car, and Toyota has done a damn good job of protecting the undercarriage of a prius. They were not kidding around when they built this thing. So we hook up the wince to the frame and carefully and gradually pull it back onto pavement with me making adjustments to the wheel. Now the folks behind the fence are trying to be helpful, I hear ""TURN THE WHEEL"" among other shouting. I remember thinking to myself that there was probably enough of them to just lift my prius back onto the curb if they wanted to help, but we just ignored them.

After getting my wheels back on the ground, the small croud began to clap. I drove home carefully, but it seems I was lucky and my car was not permanently damaged. Only my pride.

TL;DR Beached my car on light rail tracks late at night, had to call dad for help which was humiliating enough without the croud of onlookers taking photos. Luckily the car was able to drive away.

tifu,"This didn't happen today, but last week.
For some background, I am definitely interested in a plethora of fetishes, that most would say aren't normal. Some of these include ball busting, penis/genital cutting, general masochism, and much more. 

So last week, I started talking to a guy on grindr that had similar interests in his bio. We chatted for a bit and began planning to meet up to do some of this stuff, as it would be his first time. He said we could do this at his house, which was great because my grandma was home at the time. 

When I arrived at his house, we began discussing what we would like to do. And he suggested doing a roleplay of a doctor performing a botched circumsision on a patient. We weren't gonna do an actual circumsision, just light cutting. I sat in his bathtub, naked and he entered dressed in a doctor costume he presumably acquired beforehand. He had various surgery tools that looked really legit. We began to roleplay starting by chatting as if it was a doctor visit, then it was time for the main act. He took one of the scalpel, he called it a ""number 4"" and he started to make small incisions on my foreskin. This was great, but for one cut, he went way too deep and ended up cutting my frenulum as well. I began to bleed profusely and he freaked out and suggested I went to hospital. I panicked and wrapped my dick in toilet paper, put my clothes on and ran out. I got into my car debating on what should I do, I went home in fear of embarrassment at the hospital. When I got home, I douced my dick in hydrogen peroxide and kept it wrapped up in medical tape. I am sitting here panicking because I'm in fear of getting an infection, but also in fear of going to the hospital.

We stayed up till 12, opened presents, and then slept over. We woke up and John's older sister decides to go ice skating. We're all fine with this and go.

We get some bulk discount at a local rink and it is empty. If you've ever gone ice skating, you know how the rink is really icy and kinda wet for a few minutes after they use the zamboni? well that kind of texture only last for a couple of minutes before people scratch it up. There's nobody there, and we have the rink to ourselves, so we do what dumb kids do and start pushing the younger kids across the ice to each other. it was like a game of catch, but with small children gliding across the ice. 

Well heres the first part of my fuck up. This game was beyond stupid, and while I kinda knew this, it was hilarious to play. One of my younger cousins is pretty chubby, and he's being pushed to me. The ice is real slippery so he kinda just glides and doesnt stop. Well he's got a lot of momentum and when I go to pick him up (literally pick him up, off the ice), there's no friction in my shoe, so i just kinda spin around. He's got figure skating blades (they have literal knives extending from the heel), and you can see where's this going. His leg swings around and he hits me behind my right leg. It hurt, quite a bit, but i could still kind of walk. I play it off and continue. We're a somewhat rough bunch and I'm one of the older ones so I don't really mind it.

Here's the second part:

We got there pretty early but as time passes more and more people come into the rink, so we decide to stop. (not because i got hit with a in the leggy) We got interviewed by some news station while we were ice skating and the reporters were doing an ad or something. (My cousins and I were wearing matching hats and they thought it was neat, plus it was the holidays and Ice skating was popular). That was cool, but they didnt use the footage or we missed it.

Anyways, we're skating around, having a blast doing less than safe things because there's no official rink guard or anyone to watch us. We race and play tag and do all the things you're not supposed to. We usually go to a different rink so i guess this was a glimpse of freedom from rules.

One of the new people that came during this time turned out to be a classmate of John (the youngest cousin). It was a girl classmate, and I was teasing them about being together and all that. We skate around, and we end up at the ends of the rink. This area is unofficially, but always, for practicing tricks and jazz. Im practicing doing tricks while skating backwards, so i stay in this end area, and John and his classmate aren't very good at skating so they're there with me, so I can keep a watch on them. The conversation goes like this:

&gt;Me: ""Hey John why don't you help your girlfriend learn how to skate""  
&gt;  
&gt;John: ""She's not my girlfriend""  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ""Oh so this isn't a date? It seems like the perfect place for one""  
&gt;  
&gt;John: ""OP im going to hit you if you don't stop""  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ""Ohh acting tough for her?""

Now as an older cousin I wanted to tease him, and only thought he was bluffing around. He isnt. He goes for a pretty solid punch for a \~6 year old. But then he goes for a kick. He's got skates on. I'm shocked but do a little hop to avoid it. Problem is, right leg is still kind of  out of commission in the jumping department and i do an awkward slide instead. He kicks me in the left leg. Holy shit it hurt a ton. It hit about 2 inches below the knee. That painful sweet spot. I cry a bit thinking how I'll live as a legless boy, but after a few agonizing seconds im fine. Just childhood goofing around I thought.

We had to go to our grandmother's house afterwards and time was running out, so I just told them that we should leave and skated out with the rest of them. We went to our grandmother's house and I pull up my pants check out the damage on my legs. Right leg was fine, but left leg was less than stellar. I had + sign on my leg, with the middle being a hole. He hit me with the point of the front blade, that's where the hole was, but the plus sign formed around it. Looked cool though.

Anyways, I showed my aunt, since John's dad (my uncle) is harsh and a worrywart, despite the fact he already raised my cousin (same age as me), who turned out fine. She's actually the one that did all the talking when we were being interviewed by that news guy. She's a smart person and amiable person, but goes to parties and dates around, so now he ""doesnt want to mess this kid (John)"". He's somehow a traditional asian parent, yet he has none of the refinement. 

I only say this because my aunt is the polar opposite. She cares for her kids almost a bit too much. Also, the two younger cousins just happened to be in town, so usually the age gap between us and John is 10 years. John doesn't have to share, and is spoiled at times. I told my aunt mostly because I was worried he would continue violent outbursts for what I thought was just playful teasing. Yeah, I understand I egged him on, but at that point I thought that I should at least inform his mom, since this was a pretty big hole in my leg from a boy that's age 6, and was probably an empathy thing.

Well now, years later i still have the scar but i guess you reap what you sow.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: No rules or people in an ice rink. I do dumb things with my cousins that end up hitting both my legs with the ice skating shoes.",TIFU by not following any rules in an ice rink.

So my girlfriend works at the nursing home beside our building every Sunday and has grown fond of several of the residents. She started off volunteering but then they decided she deserved some pay and now she earns a modest cheque each month. I usually pop in and say hello, have lunch etc since I am 2 minutes away.

Today I came in and helped make breakfast and did some basic stuff in the kitchen, eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, toast.

They have two 8 slice toasters and I loaded them up with 16 slices of bread, the eggs were done, the hashbrowns were done and the bacon was almost there. I burned my hand accidentally when oil from the bacon went all over my hand and wrist and had to run quickly to the sink. I was in pain and not thinking, forgot about the toast and saw smoke. The toast was scorched black and burning toast was all you could smell.

I aired the kitchen out by opening the door to the eating area and then I heard panic beginning and someone yelling for a nurse. Multiple residents all began thinking they were having strokes since TIL ""burning toast"" is something a stroke victim smells before/during one.

I walked out of the kitchen into bedlam. Senior citizen residents were hyperventilating, nurses were running around, my girlfriend was down on the ground cradling a crying old woman and other residents were curled up on the resting chairs.

I kept yelling ""I burnt the toast!!"" but they thought I was mocking them and my girlfriend gave me a bit of a glare. Finally one nurse came to me and we went into the kitchen. He told me it was best I left out the side door and he would explain what happened as I sulked my way back to the apartment and set up the living room couch to sleep on tonight.

tifu,"So this story actually occurred in college, several years ago, but it's probably top 3 of my fuck ups and the most entertaining one to hear about. So here we go.

I was living in a different state for the summer to be with my college girlfriend. We were starting to get fairly serious, as we had been dating about 4 months. We hadn't touched each other yet though, as we were both in a very strict Christian college. Also explains why it only took 4 months for things to be serious.

Anyways her dad worked high up in a cleaning company, and he hired us both. One evening the three of us were assigned to clean this 8 story building in town. Her dad goes to the top floor, we were on floor 4.

So, taking advantage of unsupervised time, we begin to make out. After doing this hot and heavy, she noticed that I was, uh, enjoying it. Without say anything, she put my back up against the wall and starting undoing my pants.

She starts giving me my first blowjob ever, and that first BJ was intense. We get to the climax, and me being as inexperienced as I was... Well, as the title says, I did not give a warning. My dick practically EXPLODED in her mouth. I don't think I've ever cum that hard or that much before or since. 

I hear her gag and immediately realized what had just happened. ""Oh my god are you okay?!"". She stands up and there's a big string of cum hanging out her left nostril. She ran into the bathroom and had to blow her nose for a solid minute or two to get all of that baby batter out.

""I swear, if you ever do that to me again I will kill you"". She stayed with me after that, until I realized that her family was fucking nuts and I broke up with her before suddenly leaving a couple months later.

Anyway i take one pill in the morning and 2 at night. And i get up this morning and take my morning pill and get ready and leave and come home to eat lunch. It's rainy outside and i'm lazing around. I wait to eat bc i wasn't hubgry and I come in and eat my lunch. I ask when my parents needed to go to do something and i vaugley hear the answer. My mom says something about her medicine and i know it's a night time medicine. And i *just* ate. And instead of looking at a clock or anything i decide kimda to look out the window. It's dark.(bc of rain!) And i go over and take my meds and start thinking about a bath or an evening walk. And as im standing eating oreos my mom looks at the clock and goes ""it's 12:00!"" And it all comes crashing down. I took my medicine like a good 6 hours before i should have. Which is not great and can screw with the levels of things. And then my equally as dumbass went into the kitchen and about took a second dose this evening. Thank god I've started using a thing that tells me when I've taken it already as opposed to a bottle which is just ""did i?""

When I got home from my friends house earlier my mom was telling me that she felt so uncomfortable around my friends dad, that I wasn't allowed to go to her house anymore.  WTF?  My friend's dad never did anything to me, he keeps to himself and doesn't bother us when I come over.  She told me that I could have my friend over to my house, but not the other way around..  My friend's dad has autism, by the way.  So back to me and my friend were talking about pride month.  It was getting really deep and personal when I felt ""she should know"" I was loopy and it was past midnight so I wasn't thinking straight (heh straight)  So I tell her the easy way ""Basically your dad makes her feel uncomfortable.. to the point where I'm not allowed to come over anymore.""  instant regret, she doesn't take it well.  She goes silent.  I panic and think ""Fuck! fuck I shouldn't have said anything!!""  I message her and say ""\*Friend's name\*, Are you there?  Im sorry.. i felt like you should know..""  she replies ""Yeah im here, but i have to go to school, last day, ya know?  ttyl!""  then i tell her goodnight and say ""((even though youre gone:  my mom has a timer, and after a while she calms down and lets things happen, she said she'll let you come over here, which means we can still go to friendly and five below and all the good stuff.  we'll find a way to work around this.  she cant stop us from being prideful friends.   i  was told to not tell you any of that, but i really needed to..  you have the right to know whats going on.  I hope this doesnt affect you or us in any way....  goodnight, again..))""  she responds ""Ok, im back for like five seconds, i want to thank you for being such an amazing friend and i love you (as a friend of course)  Prideful friends for life!  Ok now real i have to go.  Gn""  Maybe she is fine because she said ""Maybe your mom will cool off and let you come over again?"" after she said she had to go..  IDK!

tifu,"Okay  here is the situation - Years ago I was bartender and used to work with  a girl - she was waitress. We worked for something like 1-2 years and I  got to know her rather well.

Last week I  met her again in a striptease bar, where she now works and we got to talk for a while. I asked  her to go out and talk more some time, she said ok. We went on a restaurant  that same day, talked a lot, she talked about her family issues and even cried at one point. We  also laughed and drank whole day, ate stuff. She wanted to go together to take her phone from repair from some shop but it was already too late so we stayed drinking more. I felt like this is normal date with an old friend.

I ended up heavily drunk, so did she. We moved  to some other place and she told me - you have to pay me - I said ok  and paid her for one hour. I joked, that it's nice that she didn't ask  for the whole day, then we moved on - she said nothing. Pretty bad idea  telling her this as 20 mins later she did exactly that - asked me to pay  a 25 times the amount I gave to her.

When I said no, she  threatened me and I laughed as I felt she was trying to play games with me. Then we left, as my mood was destroyed, she did not say much about that after this.

On  the next day I got really paranoid and am not sure what to do. Was she  extorting me, after she saw that I can pay or is it serious stuff and I  have to make contact again to sort the things out. What do you think?

I  know I don't want to see her again, after this threat but also would  like to walk calmly on the streets and don't get robbed or beaten up by  some angry pimp. I also don't like the idea to go in the club and ask if  I owe something really for meeting with an old friend, as I am pretty  sure of what the answer would be - those people don't hesitate to exploit scared people.

I am now super-scared that bad guys are looking for me, to beat me and take my valuables. I don't know what to do and even feel like leaving the city or something...

PS we did not have sex at all

tifu,"Long Story...

This happened a couple years ago.

The setup: The kitchen in my home is adjacent to the backyard. The floor is made up of slabs of tile. The backyard door is a sliding door with a screen door in front. Finally, there are plants right in front of the backyard door.

So it's a hot summer day in August and naturally, the grass and plants in the backyard are going to die. I take it upon myself to haul my lazy butt off the couch because it was summer break and I had nothing to do. I open the door and and slid the screen in front of it so that there would be some air that could come inside while I'm watering (this is important). I go outside and turn on the hose so that I could water everything. I start by watering the grass. Once I'm done, I decide that I was going to water the potted plants. This is where the f-up happens. 

Instead of filling a plastic cup with water and pouring it on the plants, I water the plants with the hose. I remember hearing someone calling my name (not sure who it was) and I accidentally move the hose up and the water splashes everywhere, on the screen, the ground, the chairs, and the backyard door. Because the screen was the only barrier between the outside world and the house and the screen is not water resistant, some of the water ends up on the tile in the kitchen. 

It turns out my family is going on a walk so I had to join them. Despite the fact that I knew the tile floors were slippery if there was water, I decided I was going to dry it later and covered the wet area with a small, circular rug.

Fast forward an hour later and the walk is over. I walk into the kitchen to get a snack, when for some goddamn reason I step on the rug. I immediately slipped and fell on my butt, with the big toe of my foot hitting the door. I cried in pain. My older sibling started laughing at me because when I told her what happened and why it happened, she found it hilarious that I was stupid enough to cover the wet floor with a rug.

As for the toe, I sprained it.

So to all you redditors: If you make a mess, clean it up, or it'll bite you in the butt later

TL;DR: Spilled water on a tile kitchen floor, knew that I should clean it up because the floor gets slippery when water is on it, I didn't and as a result I ended up having a sprained toe.",TIFU for Slipping On the Rug
tifu,"Wow, this sure does take me back. 10 minutes ago to be precise, but it seems like a lifetime since the gravity of the situation started to set in. Thank god she had to leave to an important meeting, or else I'm not sure how I'd be processing this in front of her. 


So to start off, let's set the scene. It's a late Saturday afternoon and I'm spending some quality time with my girlfriend, who I met on her first semester in University. Fast forward to the summer semester and she has become an RA (Resident Assistant) and now is living in a comfy 4 bedroom apartment in her own room (she's really excited about that part). Things are great, we just took a big ass nap and we're feeling good.

Shortly after waking up, my libido kicks into overdrive, as per the usual, and things start getting steamy. It's getting fun, clothes getting ripped off, hands are rolling over body parts, and it's finally time. 

But there's a catch to what we do in this room, because as you may guess. Universities (or at least just this one) has notoriously shitty bed frames, mostly held together with a few support beams and what seems to be a chain like mesh to hold the mattress. Which in and of itself is not good either. But we're cautious because these walls are paper thin.  So things are on the more intimate side than wild and crazy. A few positions and some time later we decide that it's time to finish up. 

I get her on her back, curl her body towards me, yank her hair and start going harder (trust me, this detail is necessary). Moments into the climax, her duty phone goes off and she has to respond. Mid fuck, we stop and she answers very professionally and calmly. 

Sounds like this is some serious business, only hear part of it. But it sounds like there's some roommate bickering and things are escalating. So she calmly says ""okay, I will meet you at the club house shortly. Give me 10-20min and I'll meet you there"". The phone gets hung up, she gives me the look, and it's go time.

I'm ramming like a motor engine piston at this point, there's no concern as to how loud we are, whether there are scratch marks on the floor, or how loud her voice travels outside the open window. And bam, it's over. And it's explosive. But not in the way that I wanted to, and I doubt that's what she wanted too.

Now the truly grotesque portion. We both know I have notoriously bad breathing, because of some nasal passage issues. Usually I pay it no mind because it's dry as a whistle. But this time was so much worse. I'm talking a 9mm bullet worth of snot flying out of my nostril at the speed of sound. I'm surprised I didn't hear a ""BOOM, Headshot"" as it happened. Its huge, it's green, and it's smothered all over her face as if shed just been part of a gangbang bukkake. 

Now sets in the shame, she got up. Got her face cleaned up as quick as possible and headed down towards her meeting. She didn't say a word, but she said she'd be back shortly. She's currently at her meeting now, and I don't know how I'm gonna apologize to her about the snot I just glazed her face with....


TLDR; Fucking Girlfriend while she is ""on duty"" as an RA (resident assistant), she gets a call towards the climax and she has to go pronto, we ramp up and have an explosive orgasm. In which the green goblin flies out of my nose as if I was bombarding a German tank in WW2. No remorse. She got up, cleaned up and left to her meeting. Now I'm sulking in shame, waiting for her to get back.

tifu,"obligatory, this happen a couple year ago/Long story.

I was just started working at a local bank in a smallish town, everyone seems to know everyone and pretty friendly environment.

There was this customer who ran a small home building business , let's call him Tim.

Tim is friendly talks a lot, bad habit of pushing his opinions (political, religious,) into conversation, typically southern red hat fellow.

I have know Tim for a while but normally he get help from another teller , this time however I was the only one available to help him so I pulled up his business account and help him with couple of deposits and withdrawal ,nothing I couldn't handle 

but here is what I noticed on his account his dad name(Roger) and another name , a name I recognized ..

me : ""I'm sorry Tim, are you a related to Tiffany Samelastname ?"" 

Tim: (stunned for 1 second) ""Oh yeah .. she's my niece.. how did you know her ?"" 

me: ""Oh she used to date one of my good friend Steve Doe"" 

Tim: ""Oh yeah I remembered him haha... small world , how is Steve doing?""

the conversation goes on a bit before Tim left the bank nothing but small talks, I didn't think anything of it again.


fast forward about a year later , my friend Steve tragically lost his love one, I attended the funeral thinking nothing but to support my friend.

at the end of the funeral I was approched by his old girlfriend Tiffany .. who broke up with Steve for a while but out of the respect of the fallen love one she showed up to support him.(They had a clean break up)

My habit of small talks start again 

me: ""Hey Tiff! long time no see ? how are you what you been up to?""

Tiff told me about how she is dating someone new and started a new job at some small company, nothing impressive Steve told me she always struggling financially.

she asked about my job now so here is TIFU

""Oh yeah I work for Smallcity Bank , oh guess what ! I know your uncle ! mr. Tim Samelastname, he's customer at the bank!"" 

the looked in her eyes went big .. I started to noticed her look.

Tiff: ""What ?! .. how did you know he was my brother?!""

I told her about the job .. How I know Tim and how I mentioned her to him because she was also signer on that business account.

Then she told me the whole entire life story about how Tim's father ... Roger.

Roger was the person who started the company , he has two children Tim and Jennifer.

Jennifer had breast cancer at a very young age, she passed away in her mid 30s left her young daughter to her dad to raise , that daughter is Tiffany.

Roger became legal guardian and raised Tiffany like his own daughter but biologically he is the grandfather , while Tim act as her brother he actually is her uncle.

Now Roger passed away a couple years back , and apparently Tim claimed in court that Tiffany has no bearing in any of the inheritance since he is legally the only living kid of Roger , while Roger treated Tiffany and raise her like his own .. he never did it make the adoption legal.

However, when I mention her name being on his business account , Tiffany contacted her lawyer, he came with her to the bank in a couple week .. demanding all the information we have on the business ,which we must comply since she is an account owner. Turn out this account was open years ago before me or my boss even start working here , it's so old it actually was open at the time of a previous bank name before it merged with our current bank. Roger added Tiffany's name as a owner when she turned 18 , Tiffany doesn't have memory of it , which isn't uncommon for 18y kid when parents asked them to sign something they usually just do it.

so the lawyer now has an ammunition to reopen her case ... for almost all of Roger's asset is under his business entity's .The cash , the saving , business cars and properties.

From what I heard .. the evidences was submitted to court and the judge has rule that Tiffany has legal right to half of all the asset ... Tim was forced to sold his house and all the assets and split the money to Tiffany.  

All this happen because I mentioned their relation at work , Tiffany was nice enough to said that she suddenly remember her signing an paper at the bank instead on pulling me into the case.

tifu,"So it was last week but figured it was time to share so others don’t make the same mistake. 

I have 2 cats and they are indoors only. Like most cats the have a hunt instinct and like to play and roughhouse. One of their favorite games is what I refer to as, ‘bed mouse.’ 

Bed mouse is a simple game where you put your hand or their toy under a blanket and make noise and they see this and pounce/attack the target as it peaks out from under the edge of the blanket. Sometimes they get the toy (aka mouse) and, win while others they miss and the mouse escapes and they have to try again. 

So onto last week and how I fucked up. 

Its 1 am and here I am in bed, it’s hot, and I am unable to sleep. So I think, I’m usually tired after I rub one out so why not take care of things so I can finally fall asleep. 

So I’m going about doing my thing when suddenly my youngest cat decides its time to play bed mouse (I didn’t even know he was in the bed with me...). He jumps out from behind some pillows and latches into my dick with his claws and teeth in one swift move because this time the bed mouse wasn’t getting away and the only thing between me and his kitten sharp teeth and claws is a bed sheet... After his attack I immediately jumped up from the pain, he ran off and just glared at me because I was playing to rough all the sudden. 

Good news is everything down there still works and has since healed up just fine. Bad news is my youngest cat no longer wants to play bed mouse.  

TLDR: Cats like to play bed mouse but one night he decide my jacking off was the same game and I ended up with a kitten attacking my dick. 

Guess I need the obligatory cat posts as well. The one that decided to attack is the one in the hat.  https://imgur.com/a/iGt2Z1H/

tifu,"This actually happened about 5 mins ago. I'm still dealing with the pain.


So I was cooking dinner after a long day of driving back home from a short holiday - a really appetizing pasta with spinach, chicken thighs, bacon and zuchinni. The final, important ingredient... chilli. As in, several jalapeno, habanero and birds eye chillies. You can see where this is going...


I'm chopping up all the ingredients, when I suddenly get a little riled up... I don't know whether it was me watching a celebrity talk show, or just a random occurrence, or what. Anyway, I went ahead and decided to go to the bathroom to jerk into the toilet. All is good, I got some material. Fantastic. Once I'm all done... I realise my dick is kinda burning a little. At first I thought I'd chafed the head with my hand or something. But the tingling turned into a burn that turned into a raging inferno, all over the head and helmet of my little fireman. Even the inside of my poor dickhole was raging. It felt like someone poking red-hot needles into my dick, with one of those spiky worm things crawling around in my urethra. I quickly realised what I had done, I thought I knew how bad it would get.


Oh fuckin boy I had no idea. The pain escalated further and further, and just kept on going. It was like my dick was on a masochistic LSD trip. I knew milk was good for chilli normally, so I stood over the toilet with the best I had (soy milk) and poured some over my dickhead. Nope. Not a tiny bit better. God damn this hurt. I was already thinking of making this post, when I realised I had some Cepacaine in the upstairs bathroom. Fuck yeah! I hobbled my way upstairs, nursing my flaming penis. Found the Cepacaine, applied it -



Ahhhhhhhhh. Fucking. Fantastic. Relief.



So that's where I am now. With my dick covered in a probably unsafe chemical, resting on the counter. I'm a fucking idiot.

TL:DR: I masturbated with chilli on my hands. Covered my dick in a chemical. I want to shrivel into the soil and die.

This is both our first times in a legal state and we were excited to go to a dispensary and try some new things out. However, we had the rehearsal dinner last night and didn’t want to smell like weed during it so we decided to go with edibles. That was fuck up numero uno. 

We get to the dispensary and ask the “bud tender” to give us something small, since we wanted to finish it that day. I don’t think she heard us right because she gave us a bag of 10 gummies, each one 10mg. I, being a giant idiot, thought this was FIIINNEEE since we smoke almost every day and I’ve had edibles before. We decided to each have 5, making it 50mg each. Fuck up number two! I realized later that was more than 10x the amount we normally have each day, we are not the hardcore smokers we think we are. Please see evidence of me being an idiot: https://imgur.com/a/Tb9okCn

I take mine first since my husband is driving and then peer pressure him into taking all five in a Target parking lot. He wanted to start with 2 and see how he felt but I, in my infinite wisdom, told him that he wouldn’t feel anything and we couldn’t bring the gummies back into the AirBnB we were sharing with his parents so he HAD to eat them all. To be fair, he usually has the tolerance of an elephant and almost NOTHING gets him super high or drunk. Almost being the key word here. 

The gummies kick in slightly for me while we walk around Target which was fun! But it goes downhill from there. We get back to our AirBnB and I realize I am VERY high. My husband is freaking out because he doesn’t think I’ll be able to keep it together around his parents, which fair. And then it hits him. 

My husband is a very introverted man and keeps to himself usually. Around me he’s very funny and witty but interactions with his family tend to be a little more formal unless he’s tired or having a really good time. My husband on 50mg of edibles was having a REALLY good time. First it was just stumbling around which I could play off as him being tired. But then he starts cracking jokes. Like, jokes sober him would never make around his family. Cue high me trying to wrangle him back to our room AND not seem super high to our in-laws. 

At this point, the paranoia kicked in. His family is going to find out, hate us, and kick us out from any future family events. My husband has now taken to laying down on our bed repeating “I don’t like this” every 5 minutes so I’m worried I’ve killed him somehow. 

At this point, all I can do is tell my MIL that we both, somehow, have a stomach bug or something and we’ll be staying in our room for a while. Everyone leaves to go to the church for the rehearsal and we take a two hour long nap that barely sobers me up enough to go interact with people at the actual dinner part of the night. My husband still feels super high which in turn is making him super anxious and causing him to generally feel like shit. So now I have to stop his sister and entire family from crowding around him to make sure he isn’t really dying AND try to pretend I’m completely fine. Some highlights of this time include:

-scaring a six year old by trying to say hello but instead just staring REALLY intensely at her 

-eating a slice of pizza but at half speed, like an aljen that just discovered it and is very confused by it 

-hugging his grandmother multiple times for absolutely no reason

-being a little TOO excited for cheesecake, cutting in front of a line of people to get some 

By 8 PM, I managed to claim being jetlagged and got my husband and I off to bed for good. Husband feels terrible that he basically missed his sister rehearsal dinner and I feel like a huge asshole for drugging both of us. I am also no longer allowed to be in charge of any plans that involve weed from her until the end of time. 

TL;DR: My husband should have listened to the DARE program better.",TIFU by getting my husband super high before his sister’s wedding
tifu,"So I’ve been traveling South America and you can find cactus fruit at fruit stands here and there. Recently I was traveling in north Colombia and saw some growing on the side of the road in a mountain pass and thought to myself “hey, why don’t I give them a try.” They have large spines that I carefully picked off first and then cracked it open and started eating the flesh inside. What I didn’t realize at the time is that under the large spines they have a ton of tiny tiny barbs that stick to your fingers... and your lips if you are stupid enough to eat one of these without preparing it correctly.

 TL;DR... I have been walking around all day with tiny little needles stuck in my fingers and lips because I didn’t know how to prepare cactus fruit. Super annoying and painful!",TIFU by trying to eat a cactus fruit on the side of the road
tifu,"Obligatory this WAS today. Also on phone so formatting and spelling won’t be top-notch, and expect autocorrect to chime in too sometimes too, yada yada. Also, TL;DR at the bottom.

So, my future in-laws (henceforth “FIL” for father, “MIL” for mother and “BIL” for brother, currently 10) were in town for the weekend. I was spending the day with them, and was tasked with navigating to some of local landmarks they wanted to visit. Idiot me was entirely unaware that the [World Naked Bike Ride](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.standard.co.uk/go/london/attractions/world-naked-bike-ride-london-2019-date-time-route-a4160131.html%3famp) was coming to my city this weekend, going through the exact same route in the city centre where we were, which I was navigating through, at the exact same time.

Keep in mind they’re fairly conservative and religious, and they have a son going through a particularly... ‘sensitive’ age. Also, while I’ve met MIL and BIL several times, this was only my third time meeting FIL, who is a man of a man, a very ‘polite and proper’, respectful, quiet, but very firm handshake and no-nonsense kind of guy. I’ve still only heard him laugh twice. What makes it worse is this weekend was the first time I was meeting him without my family or too many other people around, so really a time to make an impression.

I was distracted, talking to BIL and my partner, with FIL taking in the scenery (trees and clouds and birds) when MIL suddenly stops, and turns around. I did not realise why, and then it slowly clicked in. To my horror, I realise I’ve led my in-laws to where there are bicyclists, fully in the nude, of all ages and genders, in their hundreds, coming through. Didn’t help that a few chose to dismount with wonderfully visible peaches and aubergines there in plain view. Pretty sure I had a very r/watchpeopledieinside face as it sunk in. Mind you, I am not against promoting body positivity, and would not have thought much of it, if not for the awkwardness that ensued.

FIL chooses the path of blatant ignorance, although initially he was very light-hearted. Naked bicyclists, in their hundreds, thundered past for a few long, awkward minutes, and his response went from “Oh haha, I didn’t even see anything I was just appreciating the trees” to “...” to *turns around and walks away a few feet*. Yeah he made it that obvious.

My partner distracted BIL by going over the shopping for the day. MIL’s response was both surprisingly refreshing, and I was refreshingly surprised.  Perhaps it was good spirits, or perhaps it was to save me the embarrassment for taking them there, but she adopted a very ‘when in Rome’ approach. Propped up on a flight of stairs and announced she’s watching it.

And so we sat, watching together, hundreds of bicyclists: melons covered in glitter body spray, melons not covered at all, Johnsons and cucumbers of all shapes and sizes, peaches shifting on saddles in line with turning paddles. Not that I was particularly staring, but there was not much else to look at or talk about. And so we sat.

Eventually, I think over a good 10 minutes in, when the bicyclists became a scattered few rather than thundering hundreds, FIL grew tired of the awkward wait, rejoined us and announced we’re walking through regardless - not that there is anything special to see. So we crossed the road, stopped only by one or two cyclists in the nude (and a runner too), BIL my partner and I avidly discussed the various trees in the canopy as we passed through. MIL and FIL walked ahead of us, talking outside of earshot but I’d assume they were musing at how surprising this all was.

All in all, went much better than I’d initially feared. And I really appreciated MIL’s light hearted approach.

TL;DR: I unwittingly took my conservative parents and (preteen) brother in-law to the World Naked Bike Ride riding through my city, and had to endure the embarrassment of waiting for them to pass through for a good, long, few minutes. My FIL, on whom I wanted to really make an impression, made it quite awkward but it was all light-hearted in the end!",TIFU by taking my conservative future in-laws to watch naked bicyclists [NSFW]
tifu,"This isn't my fuck up but my dads and it just happened 10 minutes ago. I currently live with my parents with my wife and 3 kids, I got home from coaching a baseball game late tonight, kids are in bed, wife tells me the TV hasn't been working, she hasn't been able to change the channel for the last hour or so, I try rebooting the box, check the guide button, nothing happens.

tifu,"Actually, this DID happen yesterday,... and I'm not over it.

&amp;#x200B;

The family and I are in FL for a few days. We have a 2.5 yo daughter who was excited to go to the beach and pool. Unfortunately, the weather has been shit. Yesterday we decided to take her to her first movie - The Secret Life of Pets 2. It was awesome. She loved it - stayed in her seat, glued to the movie the whole time. We were so happy. Ten minutes after the movie was over, tragedy.

&amp;#x200B;

My daughter has had many plushes and dolls since she was born, but none like ""Bunny."" This small, white, soft plush, with a very particular jingle rattle had become her best friend. Bunny went everywhere with her and us. There have been many close calls with Bunny, but he always turned up. A while back we started looking for a replacement. His tag is so worn, there's no telling what brand he was. Nothing quite matches what he looks like. Google, Ebay, and Amazon have failed. We'll never know who gave him to her before her birth. Chances are this particular model has been discontinued, which is fine while we still had Bunny. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bunny is no longer white, and no longer as soft as he used to be, but she doesn't care, she never did. She loves Bunny. He's always by her side. She sleeps with Bunny in her hand. The jingle of Bunny would herald over the child monitor her awakening each morning. Bunny gave us all comfort. Until now.

&amp;#x200B;

Bunny watched the movie with us, nestled next to her, between her drink and popcorn. I know. I put it there. She asked for him after we got settled in our seats. In the excitement of leaving the movie theater, I didn't pay attention. I fucked up. I know. She was happy, and I was excited to talk about the movie and what she thought. We all walked outside to a rain storm and we quickly ran to the car. That is where it hit us. Bunny was not there. Panic.

&amp;#x200B;

A return to the theater, to the seats, only revealed that the cleaning crew has already turned the place over. There was no sign of Bunny. It was easy to retrace our steps because we only went so far. Nothing on the ground. Who would pick up this dingy, worn-out bunny? The thought of it being swept away with popcorn kernels and movie theater garbage makes me sick to my stomach. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the car, after we gave up (it was way past lunch time and everybody was getting cranky because of that), she seemed fine. Truth is she had started to detach a bit,... maybe, I guess,... it's possible this is wishful thinking. While we waited to eat lunch, I found a pseudo replacement across the street in a Kite store: a purple unicorn. She seems to love it. She was excited. Among a sea of bears, bunnies, and an assortment of other animals, she's never had a unicorn. This will have to do for now, at least.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a grown-ass man. I cried yesterday about it, after her other daddy posted on Facebook an obit of sorts for Bunny. I am crying as I write this. I'm not crying because my child lost a doll. I'm crying because this inanimate object has been a permanent fixture by her side since birth. Bunny always in bed with her. Bunny by her side when we read her stories. Bunny in her backpack when she's at pre-preschool. Bunny in so many pictures. At some point, she picked him as her favorite. She chose him and it meant something to her. But most importantly, to me it feels like she's losing some of her childhood without Bunny,... like she's growing up,... and I don't want her to grow up. I want her to stay like she is, at least a little longer. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: I was not paying attention and we left our daughter's favorite Bunny in the movie theater, and it's lost forever. She seems fine, but I'm not. I feel like I let a piece of her childhood slip away in a split second. I don't want her to grow up and I feel like I just inadvertently hit the fast-forward button. I'm a mess.","TIFU by losing an irreplaceable artifact, my daughter's Bunny"
tifu,"Hi, first post on r/tifu. I'm on mobile so sorry if formatting is weird. 

Every Sunday I go with my dad on his motorbike to places around where we live (usually 2 or 3 hours away) and he takes us to popular biking cafes and other places. I'm a small 16 year old girl (160cm) and my dad goes to the gym a lot so I look even tinier next to him. 

So we went to this nice pie place next to a lake and there's a bunch of cool looking motorbikes parked right outside and they were sort of in a rainbow pattern. My dad leaves me at a table so he can go order our lunch. I had been on the road with him for about 3 hours so I opened Snapchat and texted my boyfriend. I tell him we're at a really nice bike place and he asks me to show him. I immediately turn around to take a picture of the bikes very obviously as in I held my phone up in front of my face and everything. You know when you take an innocent picture of something but it looks like you're taking one of something (or someone) else? Yeah there was a group of bikers behind me who looked pretty tough (bit older than my dad probably) and I made direct eye contact with one of them. The bikes just happened to be to the right and behind the group so he probably thought I was taking a picture of him (let's call him Johnny). Johnny looks at me, eyebrows creased and everything and he puts his arms up like a shrug but like an aggressive one?? So I get kind of scared and turn around since I'm getting some serious ""wtf do you think youre doing taking a photo of me"" vibes. 

I keep texting my boyfriend and I'm getting kinda nervous and sweaty cause I can feel people looking at me which I assumed was the group of bikers but I ignore it since we're 3 hours out and I'm probably never gonna see them again and it was just something embarrassing that happened and it's not like they're gonna follow us or anything (wrong). I try to fix it by constantly turning around and making it obvious I was in fact NOT taking a photo of Johnny but I think it just came off as ""why does this girl keep staring at me"". My dad comes back to the table and he tells me the group of men behind me are staring at me weird (as in eyebrows creased) and I say haha ok and he gets kinda sus. Then the food comes and we finish and we leave. 

When we leave, the group of bikers stand up and leave too. I get nervous again. It was a group of like 6 to 7 men (all sorta big and older than my dad) and when they all stood up and left at the same time we did it was super intimidating. 

I get on the bike with my dad and he says he's gonna take the long way to a tunnel to take photos (he's a photographer too) and then we'll u-turn back to go home. The group of bikers happen to be doing the exact same but at this point it's only 2 of them. I can't tell if it's Johnny or not since I was too scared to look at them when they left and their helmets are covering their faces. We get to the tunnel and the 2 dudes have been tailing us for the whole 40 minutes and stop at the tunnel too.

My dad (I think he caught on ages ago) yells and asks what their problem is and why they're following us. I'm not a confrontational person and I'm still perched on the pillion and never have I ever felt this scared in my life. The two dudes take their helmets off and wow lo and behold the one that steps off his bike is Johnny. He tells my dad ""your wife kept staring at me, what's HER problem?"". It might be important to mention I'm white and Johnny had really dark skin (not trying to be rude, sorry if I come off that way!!) so I realise he might have been really offended or something. I also kind of snort because he called me my dad's wife and that really was not the best thing to do. 

Johnny death stares me and I feel like I'm about to piss my pants again. I reassure myself that my dad's bigger, probably stronger and younger and I have my phone so I can probably call the police if they try to 2v1 my dad or even if suddenly the rest of the bikers jump out of nowhere. My dad pushes his chest and I see the other guy get off his bike. I'm really hoping my dad doesn't actually want to fight. They get into an argument where my dad essentially is just saying ""I don't know what you're talking about"" and Johnny keeps saying ""you and your wife are racist pieces of shits"" and things are escalating real quick they start insulting each other's backgrounds and are yelling a lot and my dad has enough so he punches Johnny and I'm praying someone does something to stop it and luckily the other guy diffuses the situation (really wished he did it sooner though and I'm just a pussy so I didn't want to) and then it basically came down to Johnny asking me for a clarification and I apologised (I must have said it 30 times) and he said sorry he got really worked up over it and then they left no biggie (that's a SUPER shortened version of it) and after we took our photos we went home. 

On the 3 hour ride back THE SAME GROUP OF BIKERS ARE BEHIND US. I recognise them because one of them has the same helmet as me and there was a very distinct bike and I also saw Johnny. Obviously I go apeshit crazy and I'm tapping my dad's shoulder and trying to tell him the group of bikers are behind us and I'm super paranoid and scared that Johnny wasn't actually happy with my apology and is going to beat me and my dad up. But we're on the motorway and my dad can't hear me, his visor is shut and he's blasting music and I thought it wasn't safe to keep distracting him so I hope for the best. We get off the motorway and one of them (not Johnny) fricking CHUCKS SOMETHUNG AT MY DAD'S BIKE and I think it stuffed up his bike and it was making his bike make really weird sounds so he drove it to a residential area about 5 min away and he couldn't find the thing or get it out. We were about 2 hours from home so my dad had to call my gramps who has a van and we loaded the bike on it

So we got home safe at like 6pm and my mum was worried sick but I still don't know why they chucked something at us even after we cleared things up with Johnny and his friend. Have yet to ask my dad about his bike and what's wrong with it since he's been in the garage since 6

tl;dr I took a photo of some motorbikes and this guy thought I was taking a photo of him (really dark skin, me being white he thought I was racist)  and he followed us and got into a fight with my dad, we cleared things up but then one of his other friends chucked something at us on the motorway afterwards which stuffed up my dad's bike and we had to wait 2 hours for gramps to come pick us up.",TIFU by taking a picture of some bikes
tifu,"Me and my girlfriend were supposed to be on a mountain right now, but instead we just returned home.

We left with large backpacks, a tent, sleeping bags, gas and food for a week. We just finished the first leg of the journey, when we realised that I had bought the wrong gas canister. It did not fit the burner, so we could not boil water.

Of course I could make a fire, but it has been raining for a few days so everything is wet, and we also planned on moving fast and not spend a long time making fires everytime we were hungry.

We decided to leave all our baggage in the tent and walk back down the mountain. We basically spent the entire day establishing a base camp.

Sad part is that the shops don’t open until tuesday, so I can’t get a new gas canister until then. Therefore, I might have to cancel my plans to see my grandparents because of the two extra days.

tifu,"My first post using a mobile phone so sorry if it looks weird.

Today I was at work, minding my own business and waiting to get home. I work as a barista at different indoor/outdoor events. This one in particular had people selling different traditional/old stuff. This might be important later.

At one point a homeless man aproaches me. He asks me if I could help him and I said yes. He told me he found some old coins at his so called house - an abandoned place where some people who don't use it let him live. He said if i knew someone who could at least offer him around 2€, or dollars, for each. So I asked what kind of coins they were, googled them and there they were - from 100 to 1000 dollars each. 

I asked him if he could show me some, and soon he comes back with two of them. Of course they were the same as the one on the internet - or so I thought. He had two different kinds, one sold cheaper than the other. He told me he found around 70. Wow, jackpot, right? No. Of course.

All of this time I didn't wonder why of all those people of which some were selling antiques... I was the only one to take the deal. I just thought they brushed him off because he was homeless.

I offered him a coffee, some water and told him those were really valuable. He told me he knew and that he tried to sell them but couldn't because he had no ID. He seemed scared and honest, I did believe him after more questions. So I offered him half the money I have left until next week - that was around 25€ for 12 of them.

At this point I called a friend and told him about this, asked him if he could do more research on this because i was kinda thrilled with the prices online.
Long story short the homeless guy offers me 12 for 25€ and another 15 of the coins for another 25€. I agree because in theory one of them would be ten times more than that if I was lucky. Then he offers all of them, 70 - for another 25€ and ""a phone to listen to some music to"".

This is where I bring my friend into play - I ask my friend if he has a phone he doesn't use anymore and if he is willing to sacrifice that and 25€ for it, he says yes, we take the deal. He brings the coins. 75€ and an old but functional phone (note that I win around 350€ a month in my country - 75€ are kinda big money)

We were so happy, there were a LOT of those ""expensive"" ones there. I leave work an hour earlier acting sick just to check if they are actually real - I knew from the beginning that I am risking my money and I would regret not buying them after finding out they could be that expensive. And I was right, they are not. Found out rather quickly.

And I PROMISED the guy we are gonna meet tomorrow and I am gonna give him more money if I can sell those. And if I am not there tomorrow, I will surely be the day after tomorrow. 

I don't think he scammed us... He seemed to poor to know. And scared. We just scammed ourselves by not checking enough. 

And I thought I finally had money to move from the place I live in! I was so happy. So happy I won my first Big Money - if they were a real deal they would be around 3k minimum... up to even 10k. I was rather rich and happy for three hours. 

They were supposed to be silver - and I could have checked with a magnet. But I didn't. Because I'm young and stupid.
They still value more than what I lost, even as fakes, but I am not sure anyone would buy this many.

tifu,"I am an exceptionally introverted and reserved person 99 percent of my life. I have worked at the same company for over 10 years with a sterling record and high regard. Social situations are incredibly difficult for me and I was dreading an upcoming 5-day training session since I found out I was required to attend.

I made it through the first four days of the event without much incident. I was largely silent and very awkward, but neither foot was in my mouth by the end of Thursday.

We were required to attend a group dinner. I have a habit of self - medicating with alcohol to alleviate my social anxiety. Those two factors combined terribly.

I consumed many drinks at dinner and was quite drunk before I made the fateful decision to hit the town with my coworkers afterward.

We went to several bars where I continued to heavily drink.  I shit-talked my bosses, the training, and department the entire time to work superiors I had just met earlier that week. I made incredibly inappropriate comments about the female presenter of the training. I assume it got worse. 

I blacked out for hours. I awoke to some terrible pounding noise and muffled shouting. I stumbled to the source of the noise and opened the door to the sight of a hotel maid. I mumbled something about coming back later and closed the door. She immediately knocked again and told me she was sent to check on me. I was immediately at high alert. I ran over to the clock and saw that I overslept by two hours. I checked my phone. 6 missed calls from my boss, also attending the training and staying at my hotel.

The hotel room phone rings. It's my boss from the lobby. ""Are you OK?"" Not a good thing to hear. I scrambled around my room and packed up all my shit at world - record pace and ran down to the lobby Home Alone airport scene-style. My boss was and I met eyes and I realized at that moment that I was still quite drunk. We walked over to the training in silence and slinked in about 25 minutes late. Everyone saw. I had the distinct feeling that word of my wild night got around. I kept my eyes down and did my best to avoid all interaction the rest of the day.

After the session, I had to drive home with my boss. It was a tense two hour ride. We pretended nothing happened. I'm waiting for the hammer to come down on Monday.

I have nothing against weed, but I would never personally do it (or so I thought), and after he hits it I asked if I could take a hit and as I am about to I mention its my first time. So I take a hit...wait 5 mins....nothing. So I ask P for another one, take a hit and wait 5 mins....still nothing. Well after that we split up and went to talk to some other people. So here I am, just keeping an eye out for P and I ask another brother, lets call her H, if she has seen P. She says she hasn't seen him and asked why. I explain that I've had two hits of a pen, and feel nothing, and then H says use mine. Another brother who is a year older than me, lets call him M, comes over as soon as H says this and he says ""bro let me hit that first"", so she hands it over to him. This....this is where shit begins to go absolutely fucking sideways for my drunk ass. He took a decently large hit. So I say ""cmon bro, I can take a bigger hit"". So he hands it over, I take a deep breath in, and exhale my FULL lung capacity, and start to hit the pen. But...I do not stop taking this one large hit until suddenly...BAM! 

Literally, my ENTIRE CHEST is on fire and I quite literally can not breathe. I don't even know how to describe the coughing that ensued, I coughed but when I went to breathe in, I literally couldn't inhale any oxygen what so ever and my chest feels like its imploding on itself. I am bent over yacking all of my guts out so much so that I literally feel stuff about to come up as I prepare to vomit as I make my way to sit down somewhere. H and M are laughing at me as I literally can't see where I'm going and walking around like a hunchback coughing. I see a cinder block on the side of the house so I sit there (this basically becomes my home for the rest of the night) and I am just coughing so hard and can't actually breathe still. I coughed for about 30 minutes. P, H, and M come over laughing their asses off (I would too tbh) and ask if I am alright. This is the first time I try to talk and I can't so I shake my head yes while my head is slumped down. Another brother comes over, lets call him A, and he offers me some water, and I had to drink one drop at a time or I'd start coughing again. This is when I notice I am G O N E as hell. My eyes have been closed and I am just sitting there with so many thoughts going through my head, and every single inch of my body is tingling like when your arm falls asleep, but there was no pain to the feeling.

This is where the stupidity only begins. I still learn something new about that night to this day. I apparently was talking to my solo cup of water the entire time, and I decided to call one of my best friends to tell them I was high as shit and also drunk and that this wasn't a smart choice. What makes this even better, the next day I found out my phone was dead but I literally remember having a whole conversation with someone on my phone. I then proceed to open my eyes for the third time and lift my head up which took so much effort, and there's this dude just standing there staring at me, I have no idea who this dude is but I see him at the dining hall all the time. I start talking to him and my friend who was watching me asks who I am talking to. Apparently, no one was actually standing in front of me and I hallucinated the whole thing. I get back to my high self and start muttering things to myself, which apparently the entire time I have been high I have been screaming when I thought I was whispering (this becomes so very important).

Fast forward an hour or two (I really don't know as I lost all track of time), and suddenly the backyard lights are turned off and it is absolutely silent. So I pick my head up and open my eyes and see everyone just standing still. However, I only noticed that it was dark and silent a while after it had become dark and silent. So then I proceed to yell to turn the lights back on (I felt like I actually yelled so if I was already yelling when I thought I was whispering, you can imagine how loud I was). someone comes running over and it's P. He puts his hands on my shoulders and says ""Listen buddy, I am going to need you to be extremely quiet. Everything is going to be okay and we are sorting things out right now. The cops are here so I need you to be extremely quiet"" and that is when suddenly an inch of my consciousness comes back and I ""whisper""/yell ""oh shit I am so high I can't move or anything I cannot get caught by the cops"" and at that moment (actually the next day) I knew i fucked up. P wasn't nice anymore and literally told me to stfu (thanks P i appreciate you). So more time goes by and I decide to look up and I see a bunch of silhouettes moving towards the wall and disappearing, and I think to myself ""oh my god they are walking through the wall, I can't do that let alone jump the wall because I cant get up, please don't leave me here alone to get caught"". Everyone forgot about the dude who was crossed as shit and so I slowly stand up and attempt to walk, eventually I get to the back wall and realize there's a gate and I am so thankful I didn't have to learn how to walk through a wall. Everyone is walking down the alley escaping the police. Next thing you know there's a solid 50 college kids at the shady bus stop literally on the corner of the street the party house is on like no one notices 50 people are standing not knowing what to do. I try to find my sober friend who was supposed to drive my car with everyone back, can't find him. He and the rest of our group find me and ask why tf i left. Sober friend goes back to the house, and gets my car and we leave. Of course, despite me being crossed as shit my friends insist on going to taco bell, and while i thought i told them i didn't want to, I actually just told them I didnt want to in my head. So i order at the self kiosk and proceed to take like 3-4 minutes to order a single item because I am so high. I sit at a table and lay my head on the table, this taco bell is the hub of all drunk/high college kids at night so this place is busy as fuck so my friend gets my order when its ready. I am told I stuffed over half a taco into my mouth and just kept to myself. Eventually we park and my friends walk me back to my room, they all start laughing and tell me to stop walking for a second. Somehow, throughout the long night of which I spent most the time sitting down, I managed to rip my pants big time, and they didn't tell me till the next day and showed me pics.

Overal this was simultaneously the best yet worst experience of my life, and after long hard thinking, I am positive I will do it again...  


TL;DR: frat party to destress at the end of the second semester, I get drunk, then proceed to get high for the first time making myself cross faded as F U C K so much that I sat down on a cinder block the rest of the party (4+ hours) and couldn't function, I talked to my solo cup, had a conversation with a friend on a dead phone but actually heard them talking back to me, hallucinated someone in front of me that I didn't know, and then the cops were called and everyone fled but it was dark and people were disappearing once they got to the back fence so I thought they walked through the wall and I was like oh no I gotta learn to walk through a wall but there was a gate, then we go to taco bell and i shove over half a taco in my mouth (newfound talent), go back to my room, and find out I went the whole night with majorly ripped pants. 9/10 would do again despite it being the best yet worst experience of my life",TIFU by getting crossed for the first time [long]

My brother that I live with is gay, and we finally met him for the first time a few days ago. Since then, he's been hanging out at our house for most of the week. We'll call him Jamie. Jamie mostly hangs out in my brother's room, and me in my room so I don't see that much of him all week.

&amp;#x200B;

This weekend, my friend from out of town (lets call him Bryan) came to stay for the weekend, hang out, watch some games, and bs. In preparation, me and my other friend (Allen) went to the store for the essentials, beer and snacks. I got an idea while we were at the store, I suggested we buy a cake for Bryan that says ""Congrats on coming out"". Bryan is not gay, but we always make jokes about it too each other. It's become a thing in our friend group, we call each other things like that all the time, and even my gay brother is on it, but we call him straight instead of gay. Might be insensitive, I know, but we never try to insult anyone directly. Anyways, we get home and I start writing on the cake. Right as I'm about to finish, it occurs to me that Jamie is still over, and I don't know how he would react if he saw the cake, so I decided to include ""trans"" at the end of the message on the cake. (Don't want to sound insensitive, one of my best friends is trans, we just have a really messed up sense of humor)

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to my friend showing up. Jamie is still in the room and we decide to present Bryan with the cake. Everyone laughs and we all joke about it, haha end of story. Or so I thought. We leave the cake on the counter because none of us were really in the mood for cake and we really only got if for the joke. About twenty minutes later, Jamie walks out of the room in makeup and dress, and I knew exactly what was going on. Me and Allen looked at each other with an ""Oh shit"" look as Jamie walked past all of us and the cake to the back yard for a smoke. Allen immediately got up and rubbed the letters off the cake and put it in the fridge. After a few minutes, Jamie walks back in and leaves with my brother to go eat. We all start talking about how we did not expect that and hadn't seen that side of him all week and that now we all felt bad about the joke. Jamie didn't say anything to us that day, going in or out of the house and I have no idea if that's because she just didn't know us because we rarely interacted with her, or if it's because she saw that cake and thought we were making fun of her. Regardless, lesson learned there.

tifu,"This happened three days ago. Called a friend on the phone for a couple of minutes to arrange for a longer phone call to catch up with each other a day later. He abruptly ended the phone call, saying that his GF has just arrived. Spoke to him two days later and he told me that she went bonkers on seeing him on the phone and being told that it was just a friend he spoke to, she demanded seeing the phone number. I live in a different country, so she concluded from seeing the country code that he spoke to an alleged mistress and couldn't be convinced otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

She ran away furiously, went to his apartment the next day (she had a key) and pulled out all her stuff and obscenely texted him, called him a loser, a wanker and laughed at his sad explanation about me being a good friend she spoke to. He changed the door locks and they had a final meeting to exchange the rest of the stuff in each other's apartments. This ended a 10 month relationship that up to that point has been wonderful and rewarding for both of them.

Some background- we're at our family cottage that we share with my dad's side of the family. My parents, my younger brothers, and I are the only ones here this weekend. However, this place is small. Downstairs is basically all one room, minus the master bedroom (the door is a curtain) and the bathroom. Upstairs has all the beds, and usually there are curtains for some privacy, but they haven't been put up yet.

Anyways, there I am, woken up by my 15 yo brother watching something on YouTube. I text him to put this headphones on because I don't feel like using my voice, and I flip over to get comfy again and hopefully fall back asleep, which turns my back to his bed.

That's where I fricked up.

I'm assuming that's when he starts watching porn or something, and I begin to hear the sounds of him jacking off. Absolutely disgusting. Not what I want to hear on this nice Sunday morning.

I probably should've texted him to let him know that I was, in fact, still awake, but to be fair, he shouldn't be jacking off when there's the possibility of people being awake.

TL;DR, I pretended to be asleep in our cottage with no privacy and heard my brother jacking off.",TIFU by pretending to be asleep
tifu,"My gf and I usually lock our dog up in her cage overnight as she was really beginning to affect our sleep on a nightly basis. The exception being if we were working late or something and she has to be locked up all day. Well Friday was one of those days so she went ludacris speed the moment I asked if she wanted to sleep in the bed. I wake up in the morning on Saturday to find our garbage can in the bedroom ripped to shreds. That garbage can had a bunch of tissues from this nasty sinus infection we've been dealing with, as well as the shit coughed up in the middle of the night. 

Skip to later that night my gf takes the dog out and I start getting ready for bed. She comes running into the bathroom holding the dog, who at this point is being held by her ribs, still in squatting form and has about four inches of a white slimy turd hangin out there. I had to grab a bit of TP and fold that shit a hundred times to grab this thing. The worst part was that feeling of her bowels pushing it out as I was slowly pulling it out at the speed of one of her turds. It was probably the worst smelling thing I've ever had hit the back of my nostrils.

tifu,"This happened when I was around 10 years old. My parents were separated at the time and I spent time between staying with my mom and staying at my dad's apartment.

 It was around Christmas and I thought it would be a good idea to look at the search history on my dad's laptop to see if he's done any shopping for Christmas gifts. I was expecting to see searches for toys or video games but instead I saw searches on pornhub and YouTube with titles like ""Young blonde sexy foot worship"" and ""Hot toe sucking"". Of course me being a 10 year old I was horrified and deleted the searches and slammed the laptop shut. It's been years and to this day I haven't told a soul.

tifu,"This one actually happened today, and throwaway because my friends know my real account and dear lord I do not need to be embarrassed even more.

Ok so first, I live in effectively an ultra-religious household. It isn’t “religious” per say, but my parents views/reactions regarding sex are up to par with one. It is a cursed topic in this house.

I have a laptop that I bring to school, and I have a ton of stickers on the back of it that I put on a year or so ago. Since then, my interests have changed and I have wanted to remove those stickers and buy new ones. So, recently, I went onto RedBubble (for those of you who don’t know, RedBubble is a site where independent artists can design shirts/iPhone cases/magnets/stickers/etc. and sell them) and found about fifteen stickers I wanted to buy. 

So, here is where I fucked up. I was pretty proud of these stickers and I wanted to show them to my father, so I opened my computer and called him over. As he was walking over, I typed out the website address, and I remember thinking “make sure to not type redtube” (the popular internet porn site) but of course my dumbass did type it as if on autopilot.

Before I realized what I had done, I hit enter and it was over. I think my father saw the add titled “You Will Cum in 5 Minutes if You Play Now” first. He quickly gasped and I was speechless. He turned, shuffled out, closed the door behind him, and was gone. I have not faced my family since.

Fucking RedBubble.

tifu,"This happened two days ago, but close enough. I posted this story in [r/MissedConnections](https://www.reddit.com/r/MissedConnections/) too, albeit a simplified version.

I was waiting in line at an attraction at Universal Studios Singapore, all alone by myself. Then this Chinese girl about my age queues up behind me along with an older woman, who I guess is her mom.

I thought the girl looked really cute. She had a pretty face, neat shoulder length black hair, and was wearing a pink top. (I have no idea about the specific names of women's clothing, sorry)

'*No way I would ever have a chance with her, she's completely out of my league,*' I thought, since I'm just a nerdy, average looking guy.

Then after a few minutes of waiting in line, I heard her mom whisper to her in an encouraging tone: ""去跟他认识一下"" (""Try and get to know him"") At this point, the three of us were the last in line, I was the only guy near her. If anyone reading this has Asian parents, you've probably experienced a similar situation.

I couldn't quite hear the girl's hushed reply, the only parts that I managed to pick out were: ""...唉，你不干脆叫我跟他结婚..."" (""Ugh, you might as well tell me to marry him now"") And she said it in a really annoyed manner.

'*Yeah, see? There's no way dude, just like all the other pretty girls you've met, don't even bother.*' My dumbass thought, fuck I'm stupid.

Then a few more minutes pass, right when it was about our turn to enter the attraction, I leaned onto the railing beside me and crossed one foot over the other because my feet were sore from walking all day. And then I noticed she did the exact same thing with her leg a few seconds later, but standing upright without leaning on anything.

'*Wait, nobody stands like that, is there? This must be a coincidence, right? This surely can't be one of those body language mirroring thing's I've seen on the internet? I have to try something else, see if it's actually for real.*'

I immediately put my foot down, and she did the same. Keep in mind I didn't look at her face during this time because I was starting to get nervous, and I already have a tendency to avoid eye contact with people to begin with.

'*No way. Dude, calm down, it has to be a coincidence. Her feet's probably sore too, this is a theme park. Right, right, just a coincidence.'*

Then comes our turn to get in the attraction, if anyone's curious it's the ""Lights! Camera! Action! Hosted by Steven Spielberg"" show.

So we move into the room single file with the other guests. For context, there's no seats, we're supposed to be standing throughout the show. Here, there's also railings to lean on, which I did by casually resting both hands on them. And because the orientation of the attraction, whomever was in front and behind you in queue would very likely be standing to your right and left respectively when the show is happening. So naturally, the girl is now standing directly to my left.

Skip forward a few minutes in the show, I got sore feet again so I hunched over and rested my elbows onto the railing. And then the girl does the exact same thing two seconds after I do it.

'*Wait, no way, right. Yeah, no way, even a broken clock is right twice a day, for sure. You're just overthinking it, moron. Just get away so you can stop thinking about it and enjoy the show!*'

So I did, right after the briefing intro video where they showed a montage of Steven Spielberg's iconic movie shots, we were ushered into another adjacent room to our right, where they had set up props to simulate the effects of a massive hurricane on a boathouse. I quickened my pace and moved past the guests who were to my right in the room before, so I can move to a better spot where I know most of the special effects are happening (that was my fourth viewing of the show that day, I like the sound of loud thunder and heavy rain, I'm weird like that).

But basically, I had skipped across quite a few other people to get a better view on the other side of the room. And when I turned around to lean on the railing this time, this girl is right up to my left again. In my point of view, she had literally no reason to be right next to me at this point other than what I thought she could be doing, which was next to impossible in my experience. (The spot I picked wasn't even the best one, it was because I had picked that same spot in my previous two viewings.)

'*Okay, screw it. Just do it, talk to her, say hi or something. What's the worst that can happen? Here goes nothing...*'

I glance in her direction, but before I can even think of what to say, I see her mom looking right at me like she was sizing me up or something, standing just to her left.

I reflexively diverted my eyes away back to the stage, any courage I had of talking to the girl just completely gone. Throughout the main presentation, even if I had found another ounce of nerve to talk to her, everything was so loud that there was no way I could say a proper hello.

The show ends, everyone funnels out like in the cinema when a movie ends, I wanted to go for one last shot at talking to her, but I lost her in the crowd.

And that was the story of how I achieved absolutely nothing. Well, not quite, I also lost my hat that day. If anyone found a dark blue cap in the theme park on June 7th please let me know, thanks.

**TL;DR I was too nervous to say anything to a girl who was obviously making hints, and kept convincing myself that it's all just my imagination, thus I missed a chance, or at least that's how I interpreted it. Plus, her mom being right next to her the entire time didn't help.**",TIFU because I was too in denial and nervous to make a move despite noticing all the hints

Dramatis Personae:

Rob, My friend

GF, His girlfriend

Me, Some asshole

So a friend of mine was having a BBQ and a number of us were invited. My friend Rob had rented a car to do some errands with his GF that weekend and offered to pick me up on the way to the BBQ, which I accepted. I get in the back of the car and after a little while his girlfriend puts on some music which I had never heard before.

Me: ""What is this music?""

GF: ""It's Rascal Flatts, they're my favorite band!""

Me: ""Wow this is absolutely terrible.""

Now, she doesn't seem bothered by this at all, and we go back and forth a bit joking about it. I mean, I wasn't joking, the music was fucking *terrible*, but I wasn't that upset about it. However, I did not realize that I might not be the only person in the car who was not a fan of this music, and I certainly hadn't had to listen to it for very long.

Suddenly, my friend Rob grabs the iPod off the dash, rips the cord out, and throws it in the back of the car.

Rob: ""HOLY SHIT YOU HAVE BEEN MAKING ME LISTEN TO THIS GARBAGE ALL WEEKEND I CANNOT TAKE IT ANYMORE!""

As you can imagine, the car ride got really awkward and quiet really fast. 

Rob attempts to broker peace by stopping the car at an ice cream place on the way and buying everyone ice cream. It appeared to work, however the next time we were supposed to get together Rob calls me and tells me his GF doesn't want to hang out with me again. Apparently they got into it about this again later and the only way he could stave off the fight was by throwing me under the bus. They eventually got married, I was not invited, and they are now divorced.

I was talking to my mom about dating and stuff, then I remembered the most awkward date I've ever been on. I don't date alot, and the regular dates I've been on, have been with guys I was already involved with. When I was 16, I was involved with someone, and a really good friend of mine invited me to hang out, go watch Deadpool at the theater, joking about it being a date. Me, thinking it was a joke, laughed along. 

I had no idea that he was actually serious about the whole date thing until he showed up... In a suit. So I'm standing in my doorway, sweatpants (we were going to the movies, so my cute pair of sweatpants duh) and ponytail, and he's standing there in a fullblown suit. I laughed it off, suspicious but still not really wanting to believe he was serious. We drove to the movie theater, when he insisted on paying for me, I didn't let him though, I hate it when people pay for me, I just start feeling guilty. 

During the whole movie, he tried to hold my hand, have his arm around me, hug me and everything. Yeah, this was definetely a date. I didn't hold his hand or anything, and I felt super uncomfortable throughout the whole thing. Once the movie ended, he took us to get some burgers, and I had to ask him if he was serious about this being a date. That's when he realized that I had no idea beforehand. Things were even more awkward and uncomfortable after that, but we drove home and he told me that he was really interested in me. I felt so bad for him, I had no idea what to say. Keep in mind that I was involved with someone already. I apologized, gave him a peck on the cheek and left. We stayed friends for a while after that, but we came to grow apart.

So yeah... The most awkward date I've ever been on was one I didn't even realize was a date before the movie. It even beats the date I got thrown up on😂

Ps; we were going to watch deadpool

I made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  Dude was intimidating and I'm a 4'11"" woman so I was immediately scared.  He looked shocked to see me.  I'm looking at his duffel bag and realizing that I surprised some piece of shit burglar! 

I panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  I'm shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.  I start screaming at HIM to get the fuck out and that I'm calling the police (total bluff because I didn't have my phone.)  He then yells back that HE is calling the police on ME.  This gives me pause.  At this point, I look around and realize the bedroom I'm in definitely appears to be of the male persuasion.  I ask him through the door if he knows Jenna (last name).  He tells me yes, she is his next door neighbor.  WELL.  Apparently, Jenna's neighbor ALSO keeps a spare key under a potted plant.

Some context: I'm back home from college for the summer, and our home alarm isn't connected to the police because we live in a fairly safe neighborhood. Brother is 25 but staying at home to save up $$$

Anyways, last night my family was at a wedding. Most of us left around 10ish because we were exhausted &amp; had our fill of partying/dancing/socializing, but my brother &amp; his boyfriend decide to stay longer and mention possibly going downtown afterwards. I get home around 11:30 and promptly pass the fuck out. Only to be awoken the next day (today) at like 10:30 to our fucking alarm going full blast. As you can imagine the day after a wedding, my brain isn't particularly happy about that method of waking up, but I eventually realize that it was my responsibility to take care of it given that my parents had left for the Caribbean. Quickly throwing on a pair of shorts, I grabbed a golf club and went to the master bedroom to check where the alarm was triggered. Along the way, I saw that my brother's bedroom light was on so he was in there. Seeing that it had been triggered by the basement window, and the door from the basement to the rest of the house was locked (so in my mind, all the people were safe), I take a few minutes to find and grab my dad's gun.

Finally feeling prepared, and with a fucking gun in hand, I start going down the stairs while listening for an intruder. I even called out ""hello?"" while going downstairs in-case it was someone who had a reason to be there. Eventually I make my way to the game room, and crack open the sliding doors... Only to see my brother passed out on the couch there. Okay I thought, it was probably him who set off the alarm. I take one last glance around the room just to make sure, and that's when I realize that his goddamn hand is down his pants and moving a little too rapidly ffs. Needless to say, I beat (lol) a quick retreat and am now typing this post up. I made so much noise while going down there I'm not sure how he didn't hear me goddamnit.

So one time in the bath i tried to do this, and kinda forcing it, wich luckily it didnt rip or anything, but the tip did come out, but i couldnt get it back to normal, wich i didnt think much of right then, i thought this is how it should be, and im a 'real man' now!

Well that soon changed as when i was getting dressed again, i noticed just how sensitive that part is, and even just clothing rubbing against it hurted so bad, it could have been sandpaper, so full of pain and embarrassment, i did not get much sleep, my school days after that were horribly painful, as every step just scrapped my tip against my boxers.

I even tried using some tape to keep the skin around it, wich did help a little bit, untill it shot loose and hurt even more. I tried taking a very cold bath to let everything shrink hoping that works, but it didnt.

Eventually we went to the doctors, and to my surprise my skin just kinda flopped back while waiting, being very relieved i wanted to leave, but my parents thought it be best to let them check it anyway just to be sure, luckily there was nothing wrong but it was very embarrassing xD

throw away acc of course, to safe myself xD hope it makes u laugh

TL;DR i forcefully pulled back my foreskin as a kid wich caused much pain and embarrassment",TIFU by becoming a 'man' NSFW

Edit: forgot a TL;DR

So here we go. My ex and I have been talking for about 4 years. We started just friends, dated, broke up, dated again, and so on and so fourth. Just recently, we started talking again and ended up sleeping together. Everything seemed to be going great: no emotions from our previous relationship, just friends with a little side hook up thing. Unfortunately, her best friend is not the biggest fan of me.

They ended up sleeping together due to some other circumstances I am not at liberty to discuss. This happened between now and when I last saw her. Her friend gave her an ultimatum: Me or him. And she choose me. She sacrificed a lifelong friendship with the other guy for some idiot (me). At this point, I don't know what to do. She already told him she choose me over him. But I feel at fault because I ruined their friendship. Help? Do I stop talking to her? Do I stay friends with her because she choose me???

TL;DR: ex choose me over lifelong best friend. Conflicted about whether I should stop talking to her or not.",TIFU by letting my ex choose me over her lifelong best friend.
tifu,"This actually happened earlier today. Still super embarrassed, though I know it’s not as bad as my mom thinks it is. 

I’ve been sick for the past week. Nasty cough and pain/pressure in my right ear. Nothing awful, but I’ve been miserable between this and final exams and not getting enough sleep. So, my parents were very nice and allowed me to let my bf come over to eat lunch (my mom usually hates guests coming over, so it was a nice surprise they said yes). 

So, my bf and I eat, and we head up to my room because I don’t want him to go yet and we can watch tv. We do, and as we’re cuddling on my bed, I get really tired. I’ve napped with him before, and this might be the only sleep I get today, so I let myself fall asleep. Bad decision. 

I groan in my sleep. It doesn’t happen all the time, but my bf noticed it when I would fall asleep on call with him. I found out when he did (a year ago) and I forget about it often. The groaning is usually soft, and I looked into it, since I groan when I exhale it’s just something weird my body does with no bad consequences (called sleep groaning). 

What my bf and I didn’t know was that when I’m sick, my groaning is not only much louder but sounds like I’m either in pain or sexual pleasure when really I feel nothing and sleep through it. My bf thinks nothing of it until my mom barges up the stairs. 

She’s not the fondest of him. She knows we’ve had sex before (due to my doctor but that’s a different story) and she expressly forbade any sexual activity in the house. However, she also assumes I’m not upholding her rule, which leads to some awkward and bad situations, but none like now. 

My poor bf, seeing my angry mom walk over to my room, shakes me awake. I wake up to her yelling at me about doing sexual things with my bf after they so kindly allowed me to have him over and after “letting me rest all week” (since I’ve been SICK with exams but okay). My bf and I try to explain best we can that no, we were not doing sexual stuff, I fell asleep and I groan. It’s something I’ve told her before but that she shrugged off since it wasn’t a bad thing. I think she remember and she backed off a bit but also said that either he leave or we spend the rest of the time downstairs with her. I wanted to go back to sleep and I didn’t want my bf being stuck with sleeping me and my angry mom, so he went home. I fell back asleep in my bed and when I woke up got a stern talking-to from my mom about him not being able to come over for a while and for “pushing boundaries” for cuddling with him. She didn’t mention the groaning, though I think that’s because she’s upset and grossed out about it. Once she makes up her mind it’s final, so I just accepted that and moved on. I’m still really embarrassed though and am going to be super paranoid about falling asleep in the future. 

TL;DR: I fell asleep in my room on my bed with my bf, I make groaning noises in my sleep and since I’m sick they were loud and my mom thought my bf and I were doing sexual things. Got yelled at a bit and I can’t see him for a while.",TIFU by falling asleep with my bf over

I am a very clumsy person and I recently broke my  android (yes, it has a lot of importance here..) cellphone by letting it crash into the floor while speaking to one of my teachers. The screen exploded and it wouldn't turn on anymore so I directly sent my device back to the brand to get it repaired and to get it back ASAP. 


My awesome mom offered me to give me her old IPhone 5s in the meantime and I was very happy with it even though I'm not an Apple fan at all and I wasn't very good with these . Also I didn't take so much time to really custom it since I quickly wanted to give it back and me and my mother haven't got so many things to hide from each other (I was mainly very lazy to do it actually) . 

I did tell the story to some of my friends and to my gf to complain about all the pictures and memory I would maybe lose on my old phone.... 

Yesterday my gf invited me to her place as we often do to try to get mid week breaks  and she made me clearly  understand that we would get a lot of sexy time, and as always, she wasn't lying. Also, we (especially her) do like to keep track and take some pics and vids on her phone while we do it and as always she just did while we were at it... 



So everything was cool until today,  I was on a biology class when  I received a text message from my horrified mother telling me to call her immediately, I asked my teacher's permission  pretending to have a personal issue and ran out of class. She tells me that I'm a real fucker to share all of this with her while explicitly explaining to me the content of the videos and pictures we took the last day with my gf that she got on her phone from me. I immediately fell into a shameful feeling not understanding what happened and I hanged up ASAP not to keep hearing her telling me about all of this...
At this point I just tried to understand what the fuck happened and I literally stayed fifteen minutes outside just to try to imagine all the possible scenarios... 

Then it just made tilt, 


Here's what happened: my girlfriend, who also has this white 5s IPhone, has has the brilliant idea of taking my ""brand"" new phone WITHOUT WARNING ME instead of hers (as she always do) to record all of our sextape as a surprise to inaugurate my phone gallery! But the problem IS that I never disconnected from my mother's ICloud account on of the phone and  that the whole shoot eventually ended up on her  gallery on precisely her phone, tablet and computer! 


I really don't know what to do and if I should tell my girlfriend considering the fact that it's absolutely not the first time that something similar happens and that her relationship with my mom is already so fragile... 

I didn't get any eye contact with my mother ever since and my father in law told me that my mother asked him to remove it all himself since she didn't want to see it again... Someone else that I will avoid in. The next days.... 




TL;DR I just accidentally sent a whole sextape of me and my gf to all my mother's devices because I didn't tell my girlfriend about the fact that I didn't disconnect from my mom's account on my temporary phone and everything she recorded with my phone eventually ended up om my mother's ICloud...",TIFU by sharing personal sex videos to my mom
tifu,"So I took the ACT yesterday. After the math section, there was a break. I didn't finish the whole section, so after we started the next section, I was like ""fuck it"" and I went back and bubbled in D for the 10 that I didn't complete (there is no guessing penalty so it was in my favor to guess). After finishing the test, the proctor asked me to stay a minute and after everyone leaves, she informs me that they check all the answer sheets during break to make sure people don't do what I just did. Well, now my test scores are going to be cancelled over literally less than 10 seconds of my life. I feel really bad and stupid. If I could have bubbled them in during 10 seconds during the actual section, I would have not broken the rules. I have started to question if I am still a moral person. Am I a cheater? Am I unethical, undeserving, and a horrible person? That proctor probably thinks I'm a fool, which I guess I am. I haven't told my parents, I'm basically going to make up a score that's lower than when I take it again. I'm so depressed I've been sleeping all day. I need advice/guidance please

tifu,"This happened many years ago but still makes me cringe to this very day.

I worked for an agricultural supplies company. One of the lines they sold was livestock equipment, which included concrete water troughs for cattle and sheep.  One day, I was unloading some from a delivery truck with a forklift, when a workmate comes over and states that these troughs should have some sort of protection, or partial cover to stop people accidentally drowning in them. I laughed out loud and instantly blurted,

“you’d have to be pretty stupid to drown in a sheep trough mate!”.

The instant I’d said the words I felt completely horrified with myself. I’d suddenly remembered he had lost two small children this exact way whilst relatives were babysitting them.

One child had climbed into a long, half round sheep trough and slipped on the slime that had grown on the inside, hitting their head and falling unconscious into the water. The younger child followed them in, trying to pull them out and whilst struggling to remove their sibling, drowned as well.

All employees at this business knew this had happened, but it was never talked about. It had been years since anyone had spoken of it. Still, I can’t believe I was so stupid.

This happened 20+ years ago and it still horrifies me that I was so careless.

She mentioned how they only call us on holidays and how they only come to us for big events like our graduations.

I said that I talk with both of them at least once a month on the phone, and how I am constantly joking with grandpa by text.

tifu,"Yeah this didn't happen today but the last time I was traveling. I was in Gjirokaster, Albania and was new at a hostel where people were already friendly with each other, making me feel a tad left out. I went out for lunch that day and thought I saw somebody from my hostel at the restaurant I was eating at. It was a skinny boy, I'm not sure but maybe he was a ginger, very fair.. I thought he was a teenager, he was with a tan woman who was fussing over him and I thought to myself that it's beautiful when a parent takes the time out to travel with their child to bond. Forgot all about it later and went sightseeing.

At night everyone sat out at the porch with drinks and I awkwardly tried to gel in but since I was alone I felt like I wasn't doing a good job. Then the kid from the afternoon came and sat next to me so I tried to strike up a conversation. I was like hey I think we ate at the same restaurant today, I saw you there with your mom. He looked very confused and said oh the red haired woman? No she's just a friend I made here at the hostel. I was like no the tan woman with the dark hair.. I saw you guys at lunch today... He blinked a few times, his mouth tightened and slowly said... That's my girlfriend. You thought she's my mother? My face was hot and my mouth was dry. I had fucked up to the point that I couldn't even talk myself out of it. I blabbered about how he looks way younger than he is (he was in his 20s apparently) and she looks older than she is (another shot in my own foot) and then decided to escape and get myself a drink but not before I desperately begged him to excuse my mistake and not tell his gf because she would obviously feel horrible.

I come back in a minute with my drink to see my seat had been taken by his gf and she had a place next to her that was vacant. I sat down and she started making small talk. I felt relieved, I was like okay let's start afresh and I'll try to be nice to her, we talked about what she does etc., And out of nowhere she made a snide comment about something like, well I don't know, since I look old enough to be my bf's mother! Everyone stopped and stared at us and I was so mortified that I quietly got up and went to bed.

I know I handled it poorly but I didn't know how to salvage the situation but I really want to apologise to them and tell them that it was honestly a misjudgement and I didn't mean to be so rude.

Tldr: Saw a boy and a woman while traveling, assumed they were mother and son and said this to the boy while making small talk, only to be told by him that he's a grown man and she was his gf. He then told her and she confronted me.",TIFU by making everyone at a traveling hostel hate me
tifu,"As with most of the posts here, did not happen today. This happened several years ago while I was in High School, junior year I think. 

It should be noted that I am a huge asshole in this story, and I know it. I like to think that I've matured alot as an adult, but I could have handled this a lot better and not have been a selfish insensitive prick. Even though I wasn't the rich and popular football quarterback in this teenage film, I still play the bad guy. I do regret the way this went down. I'm also not the smartest guy about the situation either, as this could have been easily avoided in probably a few different ways.

So let's get started. My freshman year I met a very cute girl, who we'll call S. While flirting and talking to S we got talking about a band we both happened to enjoy. I ask her for her number which she agrees to give to me, yay! However in a flirting manner I put her in my phone not as S but under a cute nickname that relates to a song from the band that we both like. Unfortunately things dont go further with S after our initial encounter and she ends up getting a boyfriend but we remain friends and talk every now and then.

Fast forward to Junior year. S and her boyfriend break up, just around the time of the homecoming dance. What a golden opportunity, ask S to homecoming and see what happens from there. First part of the fuck up, instead of asking in a cute (and in person) fashion, I ask S to homecoming via text, however she replies with yes so I assume that were good to go.

Now we're gonna rewind just a little. Earlier in my junior year one of my class assignments was a group project, with another girl named S (let's call her S2) in my group. We all take down each other's numbers so we can coordinate on the project and what not. S2 is a nice girl but no where near as cute as S, and nor do I know S2 particularly well. 

As some of you may have guessed at this point, I in fact did not ask original S to homecoming but rather S2 by mistake. I had completely forgotten that original S was in my phone under that nickname. As were a week or two prior to homecoming, S2 excitedly comes up to me after class and wants to figure out the plan and details for homecoming. It was then that I realized what I had done. The smart and nice person would have told S2 what had happened, or at the very least came up with some excuse as to why I couldnt go anymore. I dont remember why I decided to roll with it, maybe It was because  I was panicking but that's what I did. 

Neither of us drove yet so the plan was that her and her dad would pick me up from my house and the three of us were going to go to applebees first for dinner before he dropped us off to homecoming. SO FUCKING AWKWARD! It's bad enough to go through the ""treat my daughter with respect, blah, blah,"" crap but to do in a public restaurant with a girl I'm not even remotely into was terrible. 

We get to homecoming. None of my friends are into the whole highschool dance scene so they are not there. The only reason I was going to go in the first place was to go with original S. I think S2's friends were there so maybe what I do next isnt too too bad but probably an asshole move on my part regardless. 

So here I am in a setting in which I generally dont enjoy, with a girl who I am not into and her friends who are annoying. It was at this point that I remembered that my parents are out of town, and I have weed and Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 waiting for me at home. And since my folks were out of town I could get away with smoking in the basement while playing cod (one of my favorite things in my teenage years). I live within walking distance from the school, so I tell S2 that I gotta go and I get out and selfishly enjoy the rest of my evening. I was maybe only at the dance for like 20-30 minutes tops before I left.

S2 does not talk to me again, ever. With S2's appearance, I dont think she got a lot of attention from boys and thus was pretty excited for me to go to the dance with her, as well as her possibly being into me. As I said previously I was an asshole in this story and regret how things went down.

Was a dick and left the   dance super early, with no regards towards Other Girl's feelings.",TIFU by asking a girl (the wrong girl) to homecoming via text

Then, being the sly 9 year old I was, I whispered in my little brother’s ear “Hey, go tell [friend] Fuck you. It’s a really nice compliment.” He then rushes over there before I can comprehend what I just did, and tells my friend. At this point I’m freaking out and my friend comes back crying and I have to fake comfort him and me fake mad at some confused 5 year old who just cursed someone out without knowing. Then his parents get involved in it and I feel bad the whole time but I never told him I was the one who “did it”.

This story happened some weeks ago but I have to tell you, because it really looks like a fake story but, sadly (or not), it was true.

So I have an iPad that started having troubles, and I decided to send it to warranty so it could be solved. I closed all apps, put the cover one and went to the customer service. 

I've explained everything to the employee that was there and he told me that needed to check the iPad and run some tests on Safari. I delivered him my iPad, he unlocked the screen, connected to wi-fi and clicked on safari app. All tablet-users know that when you open the browser app, it will open your last tab, if you didn't closed it before closing the app. Here comes the bad part. Safari app opens, and with this, it oppens a fullscreen video: a porn video, on the ""action"" part. 

Well, i started to blush, laughing on an embarrasing way and start looking to everywhere except for the guy. He showed a smile and closed the tab, saying that everything was ok. Everything, except me, red like a tomato.

When the iPad arrived from warranty, i had to ask to a friend to go get it, because i hadn't enought courage to see the employee again. And that's how i learned to close ALL TABS before closing safari app.

So the end of the school year is coming which means class finals are also on the way. For one of my business classes we had a review sheet which was due Friday. There were 100 questions in that review sheet that we had to do or we lost points on the final. I procrastinated and spent all of Thursday night grinding that review sheet.

It was around 2am when I finally finished all the questions. I was tired and wanted to sleep and thought, “Hey you did it, let’s watch some porn to reward ya self and sleep”. So I got some tissues and started jacking it to some random porn and I got way too into it.

tifu,"Obligitory this didn't happen today but I'm a long time lurker, first time poster; because it's taken some time to come to terms with what happened.


Back when this happened, I lived with my Grandmother, the sweetest old Welsh lady you could ever hope to meet. 


At the time I owned an imac that had been affectionately named 'the beat station' by my friends, because of my immense propensity to cancel plans and hammer out harpoons of DNA while barely legal girls did questionable things to their assholes. It was a different time, one you look upon fondly, but with a healthy spoonful of disgust.


Anyway, this was one such night, I'd decided to do my 'work' downstairs in the dining room. I'd set my imac up on the oak dinner table, switched off the lights, drawn the curtains plugged my headphones in and cranked up the brightness. I should also mention I had become tired of dating Mrs hand and her five lovely daughters, so I'd upped the anti with a Fleshlight purchase -  or for the unintiated - a plastic baby grave. 


So, I'd loaded up my entertainment of choice and happily inserted myself into the gripping embrace. Everything was going swimmingly until I hear the click of the door. I instinctively stand up, and as I do, the headphones stay in my ears pulling free of the port, snapping the jack in the process. 'OH FUCK YEAAAAAH FUCK ME YOU DIRTY PRICK. THAT'S RIGHT, SLAM IT UP MY SHITTER' (this is paraphrased but English pornography is vulgar stuff)


I'm blinded by the brightness of the screen and startled by the volume of the porn blaring into the dining room. I hit the mute button on the keyboard and that's when my eyes begin to adjust. It's my 84 year old grandmother - she's looking at me. 


This is when I realise I'm standing hands free with the fleshlight still balls deep. She lingers in silence, then disappears. The door clicks shut, punctuated by the fleshlight hitting the floor as it slips off my deflated cock like a cloak of shame falling from a meaty hook. 


I stayed in my bedroom for 2 days after. When I finally slunk downstairs to face the music, she didn't mention it, never has to this very day. She's a bloody diamond of a lady.

tifu," So the John Mulaney Challenge is based off of his story about going to the Salt &amp; Pepper Diner in Chicago. He and a friend queued up 20 plays of ""What's New Pussycat"" by Tom Jones (with a single ""It's Not Unusual"" at the 1/3rd way mark). While doing lawn work I decided to attempt it to see how far I could go...the answer kind of surprised me.  


First of all he is 100% correct that it isn't that obvious on first listening where the song ends. It is so unbelievably repetitive that unless you know what is happening or are listening intently to the words you don't really realize where one song ends and the next begins.  


Second of all...I hate Tom Jones. This song...it's really a relic of its time and does not age well. The harmony is very simplistic and repetitive so it's almost impossible NOT to listen to Tom Jones crooning and doing creepy ""sexy voice"" with very unsexy words like ""nose"" and ""eyes"". I remember listening to the song as a kid and liking it just because it was simple and loud and bold and the lyrics were easy to sing along to but as an adult it just made me feel really uncomfortable, like this is the song that is playing in the head of date rapists around the world.  


Thirdly... Tom Jones says the word ""Pussycat"" 26 times. So that is a total times of over 500 times to listen to him say the word and of course he says it in a skeevy way. The song is only about 2:15 long so that is a ""pussycat"" every 5 seconds.  


Fourth, the moment when ""It's Not Unusual"" came on was such a wave of relief. I knew what was happening and inflicted this on myself but the wave of happiness was amazing. I was singing it out at the top of my lungs because it was something different and it was a break from nonstop pussycats. It literally lifted my spirits as a wave of relief of getting to listen to something, anything else. The key isn't just that the lyrics are orders of magnitude less dumb and creepy but there is actually a peppy melody that plays along so it gives you an aural relief.  


Fifth, It's Not Unusual ends very suddenly. And then BWAM BWAM WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT blared and I was angry. My glorious oasis had been taken away and I was back in pussycat abyss. It broke me. It really did. I was able to suffer through another 5 What's New Pussycats just so I could make it as far as they did in the story and then I had to turn it off. But even with it off the echo of it remains. Now whenever there is silence I just hear it...whispering at the back of my mind. It has replaced silence for me.  


Now I am frantically keeping things noisy around me, trying to drown out the What's New Pussycat that has embedded itself into my psyche.  


I am afraid of what will happen when I finally have to close my eyes and go to sleep. When the night's air grows still, when my breathing slows to a soft steady rhythm....BWAM BWAM WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT!!!

tifu,"So my lover enjoys a bit of rough play. He especially enjoys it when I use a coat hanger to smack his ass red. I am a pastor IRL so it helps to be an alter in the bedroom. I am ""Bishop"" when I am in the bedroom. My lover gets down on his knees and.. The Lord only knows what goes on behind the closed doors.

The smacking got really vigorous and rough. At one point his ass was like two mounds of strawberry Jelly just wobbling away. With every whip there was a gasp and begging for more. He's a glutton for punishment and I don't mind dishing it out. My arms were getting pretty tired smacking so I decided I wanted to move on to phase two of the lovefest. He was having none of it. He wanted to be smacked a few more times. I began smacking him really fast and hard, hoping he would give me our safe word. 


I beat and smacked his ass faster than a washing machine. I circled my arms at full speed, coat hanger in hand, swinging like a wind turbine. Next minute I heard a sickening ""squelch"" and a spray of what I can only describe as blood and fluid squirt up into my face. I pulled the coat hanger without thinking and my lover screamed at the top of his lungs.

I feel a bit selfish in saying this but I told him to shut the fuck up, as the motel we were staying in had a strict policy on noise and having hotel guests staying over without signing in to confirm and pay a fee. The blood and fluid was spraying across the room. His eyes was rolling back in his head. I looked down at his dick and retched.

tifu,"  This story takes place about a year ago. I used to run cross country and some days the team would play a game of Ultimate Frisbee [UF] for fun after practice and if the coach was nice enough we would play UF INSTEAD of practice. So on a day we were playing UF instead of practicing we split the team in half and played. Also important to note is the fact that cross country kids are fast but honestly not good throwers.
  Ngl I kinda got the sucky team and we were honestly getting dicked at first. I decided to go super tryhard and it somewhat worked, we managed to score a few more points but were still behind. Later we catch up to the point where we are only one point behind. I'd like to say it was thanks to my efforts but a lot of it was also due to the fact that the other kids I was with had stepped up their game as well. 
  Finally, we get the frisbee and get close to the goal. Some guy named W gets the frisbee and throws it to me. I was wide open since we had just run down to that area of the field but, like most cross country kids, his aim was off. He threw it really far to my right and somehow it was hovering 1 inch above the ground. 
  I quickly ran over to catch the frisbee and successfully caught it, tying our scores. However, as I caught the frisbee I was in an awkward spot where I had bent over at my back to catch it while running full speed, which resulted in my right leg that was in front and completely straight at the moment I caught the frisbee to bend at my knee sideways at a very bad angle. I fell to the ground and heard a pop noise in my knee and my knee exploded in pain. 
  My team recognized I was injured and carried me to the side lines and asked if I was okay. I told them I was and I just needed a break, so they resumed playing. My team was a man down and got annihilated, and due to my knee injury I was unable to run for the rest of the season.
  I did get a doctor to look at me knee, and they said I probably injured a ligament in my knee. My parents got x-rays (which revealed nothing) but refused to get an MRI (too expensive) so the doctors couldn't see what was really wrong. My parents just hoped it would heal on it's own, and a doctor prescribed me 2 weeks of steroids so my knee would heal faster. The steroids didn't do much other than make me hungry. I gained 10 pounds in the 2 weeks I was on steroids and my knee healed to where I could walk but not exercise. It never got any better than that. 
  Today I have gained a total of 35 lbs. since my knee injury, and will continue to gain more as I am unable to do more than walk or stand. Running, bicycling, and kicking my legs when swimming hurts too much so I cannot exercise. I had a couple girls who thought I was attractive but 35lbs later they have changed their minds. Basically, my knee is fucked up and it won't heal and I have been continuously gaining weight due to this. My dad still doesn't want me to get an MRI even though it's almost been a year. I do try to eat less but my brain won't function if I don't eat enough and I have a job where I walk/stand a lot for exercise and I'm still gaining weight. Eventually I'll join the cast on my 600 lb life I suppose.

tifu,"The realization of my fuck up was a few months ago and I still feel really bad about it. 

I have a beautiful, solid-black, long-haired cat. She is rad as hell. The kind of cat that will let you rub her belly (without scratching the fuck out of your hand) and is basically a pro at snuggling. I got her when she was 6 weeks old and she's been with me ever since. She just had her cat-ceanera (turned 15). 

Anyway, on to the fuck-up. Because she is a long-hair cat she has always had a tendency to hack-up hairballs every now and again. From the ages of about 7-9 the hairballs got progressively more frequent. She went from 3-5 a year to about 3-5 a month. I finally got sick of it and started buying the more expensive, high-end cat food that is supposed to help reduce the hairballs. 

It worked pretty well for a few months and then she was right back to it and they kept getting worse. Over the next few years she went from 3-5 a month to roughly 3 times a week. Additionally, the consistency went from mostly hair with a little bit of barf to mostly barf with a little bit of hair. I tried different expensive brands for sensitive stomachs or specifically for hairballs. Anytime, I changed the food the frequency of hair-balls stayed the same.  

Then about 6 months ago, my GF was at a friend's house and that friend recommended a different cat food and swore by it. I thought, ""might as well try."" I bought the new food and it was a disaster. My cat couldn't keep it down. She was now barfing up ""hairballs"" multiple times a day. I tried switching her back to the old food and she wasn't getting any better. I felt helpless. 

I had looked online before with minimum results. But this time, after doing a bit of research, I found out cats can be allergic to their food!! The suggestions that I saw recommended that I try multiple brands and narrow down which ingredient my cat might be allergic to. Have you ever read the ingredients list on cat food? It's a fucking mess. There is so much trash in there. So, I decided I would start with buying whichever food had the least amount of ingredients. This isn't sponsored or anything, but [Instinct Cat Food](https://www.instinctpetfood.com/cats), saved my cat's life. I switched her over to their limited ingredient formula and voilà she was cured! 

My cat has gone from 1-3 barfs a week to less than 1 a month on average. And because life with my cat cannot be dull, my cute little buddy has now developed a new health issue. She is obese. She went from 8lbs. to 13lbs. and now has weight related asthma. 

Hopefully someone can learn from my mistake. If you're cat is barfing, buy the expensive food with the least amount of ingredients. 

And in case you were curious here she is:

&amp;#x200B;

**Context:** My mother works as a Library Assistant, meaning she works at the info desks and sorter room at a specific library. I work as a Substitute Page, basically, I shelve books for 4 hours at libraries that need people like me. On a special Saturday, I'm sent to my mother's library so we carpool in her car. Once we get there we swap keys since I brought mine too. ***May the story begin...***

&amp;#x200B;

It's 1 pm, or 1300 if your phone's set to 24-hour time. I'm heading to the break room to enjoy some Pad Thai with my mother, of course, it's impossible to cherish lunch without a can of Dr. Peeper. So I head to her locker, grab the can and lock it. The only image projecting in my head being the Pad Thai.

&amp;#x200B;

15 minutes pass after lunch and I'm completing daily challenges in Microsoft Solitaire. Then I get a call from my mother. Keep in mind I'm *still* at the library. I answer and that's when the **IFU** in **TIFU** slaps me across the face. My mum was about to get her purse from the locker when she noticed my mistake. And to pour salt onto the wound, the key to the lock was inside. And to add a decent amount of cayenne pepper to the mix, my car keys were in there. So here we are, my mother without her wallet and license, and me without my keys. So what did I do?

&amp;#x200B;

I watched a youtube video on how to pick locks with paper clips. Did I attempt to recreate those picks? Yes, all three of them. Using safety scissors and three paper clips, I've created a cheap man's version of a feeler pick, what I assume was a rake pick, and miserably crafted a tension wrench. If this was a DnD campaign, I must've rolled a 13, a 9, and a 3 for craft checks. Showcasing these tools to my mother, I confidently went up to the lock and did as the video told me to.

&amp;#x200B;

I just shoved it in. That's right kiddos. I stick the tension wrench in the you know where, then I  inserted whatever was in my hand into the lock. After multiple failed attempts, I deem this miserable Applied Tech project a ""D-"" because it didn't work and led to a fiery irritation on my baby-skinned fingers. I was ready to go to Wal-Mart when a coworker shows up.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me that we have a lock cutter located near the mailboxes. How convenient. So I get my Mum's consent and start cutting through that bad boy. What I really needed was jet fuel because scrawny beta boy me doesn't have the strength to force it open. Then again if you were the unlucky soul to pass by this incident, you'd be telling a different story. In the end, I just gave up and went to Wal-Mart. My mom needed a bag of chips anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Highlights on my Journey to the Wal of the Marts:

\- Saw an old friend

\- Bought Sprite Lymonade (I'll stick to Dr. Poppers)

\- Paid $20 in groceries, lovely...

&amp;#x200B;

Cut back to me rushing to the backroom with a bag of groceries and a rope of hope. I forgot to mention that the plan was to buy the same exact lock and use their keys to unlock the one I've spent 40 minutes breaking into. No, it didn't work. So there I am. Standing there without a single drop of hope. No plans presented itself. No Youtube videos came to mind. Just silence.

&amp;#x200B;

That's when I picked up the lock cutters and went at it again. After what felt like years of struggling with the lock, I twisted the tool and was surprised by a sound. Not the sound of cracking metal. But the sound of a clink, as if the lock tiredly stated, ""I think this has gone far too long.""

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Spent two hours trying to break into a lock with paperclips, a lock cutter and $20 after accidentally locking the locker with the lock key inside.

tifu,"This happened several years back, but I was sharing embarrassing stories with my coworkers when I remembered it and all of the shame came back to me. 

I was in the theater with one of my friends, we were about 14 at the time and I honestly can’t even remember what the movie was. We were in that young teen girl stage where every guy was a creeper and we laughed at everything. The really annoying stuff. 

As we were watching the movie, we heard a man behind us making suggestive sexual moans and breathing at us. We were too embarrassed to turn and face him and ask him to stop so we had a better idea; we decided to show our disapproval by throwing popcorn at him and giggling about it. 

The movie goes on and his breathing doesn’t change, he doesn’t say anything except occasional mumbled to himself, and we are having a very awkward time thinking this man behind us being very perverted. So we keep throwing popcorn. 

The movie is finally over and we’ve depleted our popcorn reserves, so we plan to book it out if there as fast as we can. 

The lights come on, we stand up, and then it hits us. The man is in a wheelchair, obviously a paraplegic of some sort, and on a breathing machine. His breathing was labored because he was hooked up to equipment. He is COVERED in popcorn and just turns and rolls away out of the theater, leaving a trail of popcorn behind him. 

I had never felt so much shame in my life and didn’t even know what to say, my friend and I got out of that theater so fast we didn’t have time to blink. As we walked out of the theater we saw the man being loaded up into his van by family. He still had popcorn on him. 

TL:DR - thought the man sitting behind us was breathing suggestively towards us in the theater, so we throw a ton of popcorn at him. Turns out he was disabled and hooked up to machines for breathing assistance.",TIFU by throwing popcorn at a man in a theater
tifu,"I went to the movies last night with my wife, we got seated towards the back of the theatre, and when we sat down, we realised there was a row of about 10 teenage boys in the row in front of us. I wasn't too worried initially because they were being pretty well behaved and they had an older couple with them - it was clearly a birthday for one of the kids and the parents had taken them all out to the movies.

Anyway, once the movie started, there were a couple of kids in the group who just wouldn't be quiet. They were at the far end of the row, away from us, so we couldn't make out what they were saying, but it was constant, and really distracting.

After a while, when it became clear that the adults of the group weren't going to do anything about it, I leaned over and exasperatedly said to the Dad, ""Can you please tell those kids to be quiet?""

The guy replied, ""I'll tell them to try to keep it down, but just to let you know, they're autistic.""

I muttered a very quick ""Thanks, mate"", and sat back down, hoping the seat would swallow me whole.

tifu,"I'm a 30yr old male and I fly a lot for work. Everytime the plane would descend I found myself with the most unbearable headache, a sharp intense shooting pain in the middle of my head. To which only I can imagine as being stabbed with a blunt knife, it was horrendous the first few times, but something I could prep for. Medicine, ear plugs, spray, water, sweets to suck, I'd take it all. 

8 months ago whilst flying back from Barcelona I had the worst episode yet, I don't recall the landing but only some older lady doing her best to comfort me on the plane. I'd had enough and thought it best to investigate, this can't be normal right?

After 6 months of different steroid sprays I was sent for a CT scan. My sinuses have no drainage tubes (well very small), due to breaking my nose a few times when I was younger I had a small right nostril and also there was lots of little air pockets and other random crap which isn't normal up there. 

I opted for FESS (Functional endoscopic sinus surgery) and I was advised by my private surgeon (UK btw) that I'd feel like I've had a cold for a few days and be back to normal. Well this is FU one, I spent all night on Tuesday bleeding constantly as what can only be explained as a nose period, it was constant. I couldn't breath through my nose (obviously), swallowing would cause my ears to pop and my nose to make this odd clicking sound.  It was the worst nights sleep of my life, I use the word sleep loosely, I spent all night changing my dressing for my super new red mustache. Every day since I've woken up with a mouth like the Sahara desert, lips with more cracks than GOT season 8 and been in intense discomfort.

Scene set! somewhat anyways, here comes the main FU. It's been 4 days post surgery and for the first time today I could breathe a little through my nose, I could smell, albeit very slightly and I was horny. It's been a week since my wife and I made love and nothing was stopping us tonight. 

Before I left the hospital, my surgeon told me that he had implanted two dissolvable pads into my sinuses to help with bleeding and stuff. That was all I was told, as any normal human I'd imagine that after a few days they'd just become a part of me. How wrong I was!!

Wife and I are taking it easy, nothing too crazy as my nose is still a bit leaky. We adopt doggy as our finishing position and it was great, until I felt this thick drip off something out of my left nostril. Not to worry, I was close! I wiped it away and carried on. The finish line is close, eyes shut, hands firmly holding on, I was going for it. Until...

This slug starts making its ways out of me, like a scene from Alien it bursts out of my nose and onto my wife's ass (I'm still laughing/crying inside). At this very same moment, you guessed it, I ejaculated whilst pulling out in panic. If you've ever seen Thousand Island sauce you'll know where this is going, a red/cummy sauce on my wife's ass and our sheet with a little slug sitting there staring back at me.

This is hopefully my first and only worthwhile TIFU, however as some of the meds I'm on have made it impossible to sleep I thought I'd share this with you all.

Actually, there is one more slug inside me, so bring on round two tomorrow!!

     2 weeks ago I graduated Basic Military Training and have been sent to another base for Technical Training where I will now learn my job. The base I’m at now just finished building a pool, so me, like other people on base, decided to utilize the brand new pool put on our base. Me and my buddies went and were having a good time just hanging out at the pool, playing games and overall just messing around. One friend of mine comes to the great conclusion that: we should make a line of 20 people and jump in all together. Exhilarating right? It is to a ton of people coming straight out of Boot Camp. We all jump on that idea, get in a long line, count down from 3, and then all run and cannonball into the pool. Now, somewhere in between the shouting of “1”, and doing the deed of jumping in, I managed to get a fair bit ahead of my buddy next to me. In doing so, managed to be in the pool before him.  As for him, in that time span, he managed to get behind me, jump in after me, and bring his knee down with quite a bit of power, on the back of my head. This blow to my noggin stirred me bit. I was phased for a second, shook it off, then hopped out of the water. We thought nothing of it, we had a good laugh about it, no worries. 20ish minutes later, me and the boys decide to leave, so we get out and start drying off. We all have white towels, and after drying our heads, my towel started looking far more colorful than everyone else’s. I ruined my towel getting blood all over it. This freaked me out a bit, but my friends calmed me down and said to go to my room and take a shower. I did just that. My friend was stayed in my room to make sure I was alright and didn’t have any serious injuries. Unfortunately, I did. After cleaning my newly acquired wound, he got close to it and took a good look at it to make sure I was alright. The gash was so deep and so wide, he could see my skull. So the rest of my (supposed to be) “chill night with the boys”, turned into a fairly lengthy ER trip ending with a few staples in the back of my head. Overall: loving the new pool.

This happened a long time ago, but I've never been able to tell my story before.

So here I am, a young, horny teen boy (probably around 13/14) doing my standard shower routine, the wank and wash, and I come across a small cylindrical bottle of shampoo. It's about the size of my finger, maybe a bit thicker. Me being the curious idiot I am, I thought to myself ""huh, yeah that's going up my ass"". And so it did, and I really like it. I'd like to take this moment to mention that I'm not gay, and I'm actually still a virgin, I was just a very curious kid who liked butt stuff. Anyway, this went on for a few months, adding it to my ""daily exercises"", but as time went on I got a bit more curious, and frankly, I was really fucking horny, and decided to try bigger things. I tried using the back of a plunger, the case for a bubble wand, a soda bottle, and a bunch of other fucked up stuff, until I found it. The holy grail. The ping pong ball. This wasn't any ping pong ball though, it was one that me and my brother bought in bulk, not knowing that they were extremely poor quality, or at least for table tennis. The problem with them was that they were slippery on the outside. Instead of being the traditional matte finish, they were shiny, and didn't bounce properly. But they did do one thing right. These bad boys slid up my garbage shoot like nothing before, and quickly became my favorite new toy. Until one day I got a bit too horny. So I was sitting there, in the shower having a grand ol time, and decide to go for round 2. I shove one up, and then push another behind it, it was hard at first, but once the second one was in there was no going back. I take the third one, and shove it in. Surprisingly, it didn't hurt at all, and being the dumb ass I was, I did this probably 4 or 5 times before getting out of the shower. A few hours later I was taking a dump, no problems, until I went to wipe. (I'm a front wiper, so I could see everything) The bowl was bright red. I'd just shit blood. I'd given myself ping pong ball anal induced hemorrhoids. This went on for a week or so, but I was too scared to tell anyone.

Where I am from we have these giant speedy spiders. They’re harmless, but terrifying. The [Huntsman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsman_spider) spider. I have a big fear of spiders. Even the tiniest ones. 

So I was chilling to some Netflix when I suddenly had to pee. I did what any normal human would do, I went to the bathroom to pee. I didn’t do the normal toilet inspection to check if the coast was clear, that’s when I fucked up. I sat down and was doing my business when all the sudden I felt a tickle on my vagina. I thought that was weird because who the fuck is tickling my vagina? 

I jumped up mid pee and started panicking. I turned around to check and nothing was there. Wtf? Now I’m covered in pee over nothing... 

That’s when it happened. The biggest fucking spider ran from my ass to my stomach. Now I’m doing the ‘get it the fuck off me’ dance tryna get this thing off. I fall in the tub, still with my jeans around my mid legs, flailing around like a dumbass while covered in piss. My sweet loving boyfriend is banging on the locked door thinking I’ve injured myself.

tifu,"TL;DR at the bottom.

I will start off by saying this did not happen today, but a few months back.  I was working selling used cars at a large auto group, but for the Nissan store.  To clarify before getting into this, the dealership was split between two sides of the road (new building on one side, used on the other), which will become important in this story as the new car salesmen had to drive their trade-ins across the road to get them appraised.

&amp;#x200B;

So, here we go.  We had recently hired a slew of new individuals.  Once of which, we'll call Matt.  Matt, was one of those people who was very socially awkward, avoided meaningful interactions, and had some of what most would consider ""strange"" hobbies.  I liked the guy well enough, but others thought he was weird, but whatever.  Now Matt did not do well in the whole interacting with customers gig, so they eventually moved him back into our BDC department to aide them with whatever they needed (awesome I thought, they found a place for him!), as well as sometimes help the new salesmen out by driving their trade-ins across to get appraised.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this dealership was great, including the fact they bought us lunch on Saturdays, mainly to keep us from taking our lunch break on the busiest day of the week.  The BDC department was in charge of doing this lunch each Saturday, and they did a great job (irrelevant).  Now, one unfortunate Saturday, me, along with some of my buddies at work are in the sales tower shooting the sh\*t with our managers.  I remember this quite vividly, and I am still embarrassed about the unfortunate transgressions which took place after.  So, there we are giving each other the business as usual, when I see this beyond hoopty rust-bucket of a car pulling into our lot and heading towards the parking spaces (easy pickings I thought).  I beat everyone to the door, go out to greet the vehicle as they are parking, only to have Matt hop out.  Now, in my mind, I am thinking he is here to get this piece of rig appraised.  I go up to him and start giving him the usual jabs I would give any other salesman who brings crappy appraisals over, and turned it up a bit as well.  I greet him by saying ""just hop back in that thing and go back, we do not want it"".  Followed by ""Jesus man, I can tell you right now what the managers will give for that hunk of crap.  Can't be more than $100."".  Clever crap talk I thought to myself proudly.  However, Matt's face just drops and doesn't say a word.  Odd, but he is very antisocial, so I thought he was just there to do his job.  We go inside together, and I thought I'd get a rouse out of the boys and bolster again loudly to everyone ""I'm telling you, just get back in that hunk of junk, we're not giving you more than $250 for it.  It's all beat to crap, rusted and has literal holes in the side of it!!"".  Got a few laughs, but then things turned South very quickly..  Matt still had not said anything, and had hunkered his shoulders and walked with his head down into the office.  He approached our general sales manager who was there at the time, to which I thought he'd request an appraisal.  No, I was absolutely dead wrong.  He walks up to him and says ""Miranda from BDC sent me to get the money from you for lunch"".  Everyone stops their conversations dead, and in my mind was going ""what the f#ck did he just say??"".  The GSM proceeds to pull out his wallet, and hand him the money.  He takes the money, turns like the Manchurian candidate, walks shamefully out the door and gets in the car and leaves.  Well, turns out this was not a trade-in, but in fact Matt's own car!!  My GSM heard my interactions with him, and proceeded to chew me out up and down.  I felt dread, guilt and shame all in the matter of about 15 seconds.  I talked to the BDC girls later on (which usually they are good pals of mine), but they told me Matt had told them what I did, and they could not believe I would do such a thing..  Things eventually went back to normal, as I was very liked there, but for a brief moment in time, I may as well have held him down and sh\*t on him.  I felt bad, and still do to this day.  Sorry ""Matt"", was just trying to have a little workplace banter :(.

     So there is this girl that I've dated for a total time of around two years, we were off and on and we were pretty young, but I knew I truly loved her. No matter how many times she broke my heart or hurt me, I kept going back to her. We started dating for the last time in December 2018 and she had broken up with me again in early February of this year. There has always been this guy, right from the start that always tried stealing her from me, and every time I asked about him it's always the ""you don't have to worry about him"" bullshit. She even went as far to say ""I'd never date him"". 

     Fast forward to last week,my ex and this douchebag start dating. Oh I was fucking livid. I put countless hours of driving and taking extra shifts at work to try not to think about it. I understand that we haven't been dating but I've known and always liked this girl for over four years at this point, and totally loved her for three. So yeah, her lying to me about that really fucking hurt. 
    
      Fast forward to today, she posts a picture of her and him together (something she never did with me). I get super pissed and in the heat of the moment, I DM her and say the following fuck up; ""I hope you choke on *douchebag's name's* tiny dick 😘"". 

     For about five minutes, I felt great about it. But after that six minute mark, shame washed over me, as I open her response.

Like I'm pretty well above the average for my race, but this dude has inches on me, and makes my chode look like spaghetti.

     She sent me another DM, saying ""I'm pretty sure I will 😉"". My pride is destroyed, my Johnson's feelings are hurt, and worst of all, my ex humiliated me.

tifu,"So this happened like yesterday and I'm not sure how I'm going to play it cool on monday at school.

Currently my uni is approaching finals season and I have a group paper due for one of my classes. So for the whole of yesterday afternoon I'm with my group (three girls and two boys including me) finishing up our research topic together in the school main library. Our group thought that the paper is going to take some time to finish so we decide to take turns and rest while others write the paper. I decide to take a brief nap and this whole unexpected turn happened.

Since it's finals season, I'm naturally sleep deprived and didn't have to the time to satisfy all my needs at this point. I completely doze off in a deep sleep right away and out of no where I'm like dreaming all these sexual stuff.  Okay, why not enjoy the dream right? While I'm dreaming I'm suddenly woken up by one of the girls in my group.

She has this worried look on her face and she goes ""You were moaning in your sleep. I was concerned that you were having a fever or something."" and the whole group just stared at me...Of course I couldn't tell the truth and I just replied ""Yeah, I think the lack of sleep is affecting me""

Since I woke up I thought might as well start researching. But then something felt weird. I looked down and I was mortified with what I saw.  I literally jizzed in my pants with that less-than-1-hour nap. FUCK. And the fact that I was wearing a grey sweat pants didn't help hide the growing stain.

I guess that girl who woke me up was still watching me and she instinctively turned her attention to where I was staring. I'm 100% sure that she saw my stained pants and out of pure shit luck when I was turning my head her eyes and my eyes met.

I didn't hear to what she said. I just grabbed all my stuff and use my bag to shield my stain of shame and just ran down two flights of stairs and out of the library.

After catching a cab and returning to my room, I got a text from one of the group member saying ""wtf, why did you run away suddenly? And (the girl who woke me up) left soon after saying she wasn't feeling well""

I just replied ""family emergency"" and now I'm not sure what I should do to diffuse this whole situation.

It's gonna be an awkward monday for sure when I have that lecture.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I had a wet dream in middle of the school library while doing a group assignment. And I'm pretty sure one of the group member saw that.

UPDATE:

So....... the group of girls who is close to the girl who woke me up gave me a weird look.... but I played it cool. No biggie. Just took my lecture. A close friend of mine asked me what's up since I had a pretty shit face today. I messed up a bit by telling this story to him who proceeded to give me the ""jizz in my pants"" face like every 10 second. Should've have said anything.

tifu,"(PSA: this did not happen todayS.o my mom has a streaming device at her house that goes on screen saver mode and shows pictures from your phone through its equivelent of the cloud in a slide show style. One day i walk into the living room where the tv and the streaming thing is, and see a picture of my mom with her breasts out. I stand there for a second or two in before heading back out of the living, questioning if i should confront or just hope she notices and fixes it. I decide to do the latter. It should be noted that my mom is recently divorced and getting back into the dating scene, so i figured she was sending some lewd pictures to people or something. A day or two pass after this and i find myself entering the living room again, this time theres a completely normal picture. Then the slideshow switches to a picture of my moms vagina, shes in the room this time so i promptly say, ""Mom what the hell?"" She replies saying that she doesnt know what it is. *but you took the fucking picture.* now i didnt look at it for more than a second so idk, maybe she just wanted to show her revolutionary method of holding roast beef and it was completely innocent.

And John looks at me, with a straight face and says “My dad’s funeral”.. to which I could only say “oh my,, I’m so sorry”.
I did go over to apologise again, and he said it’s fine, and that yea it’s a tough time for him.

A bit of back story:
I woke up around 1pm because couldn't sleep at night, made myself some toasts for breakfast, got into my car and went to school to practice for a hard, practical exam I have this Tuesday. Obviously everything was closed and all I did is kissed a doorknob. Soo to make that trip just a little productive i decided to clean and scrape down some bits of paper glued to the back side of a back mirror in my car, probably from some stickers previous owner out there. Didn't go so well and I managed to get just a bit of and gave up. So while I was trying to get it back on (It has a press fit mind you) I pushed so hard without thinking that I broke like 1/3 of the front glass. So now I have to somehow swap the whole thing tomorrow before any police notice and give me a ticket and take my car's registration papers.. I'm gonna go now and cut myself with some dish soap.

Let's say some time during the last 365 days.  
I realise that this story is long but it's definitely worth reading. Thnx.  


So I had just started on this school a long way from home, and I had gotten a few friends and all that, and we were heading to the local store to buy some junk I guess. We found everything we wanted and went to pay for it. **That's when it hit me, this beautiful creature working in this store, like a god sent from above.** I'm Speechless. I paid and we went on with our day and then as the creepy loverboy-hunter I am - **I obviously had to ask the internet for his name.** So I opened this app called ""Jodel"", to post small text-posts anonymously in the local community (everyone in a certain distance can see my post and reply). I then asked if anyone knew the name of the beautiful guy working at \*NAME OF THE STORE\*. **And as we all know, the internet is a beautiful thing - so of course I got an answer.**   


**Problem is;** the one who replied and gave me the answer..... turned out to be fucking working at the store. 

**GOD! WHAT HAVE I DONE!**

&amp;#x200B;

So he obviously told him. And I obviously told my friends about it. So every fucking time we went to the store, they made so much noise and trying to expose me as the anonymous stalker but talking loudly about it. The year went by and this obviously became my favorite store so I went there all the time even though I wasn't even going to buy something. I just tagged along whenever one of my friends had to go to the store. So I got to see him OFTEN. 

&amp;#x200B;

I even stalked him online. Looked at his pictures on facebook. Found his Instagram. His adress, his friends. So one day I even found his car when we were driving in the area and we stopped so that I could take a picture with his car (why did I even do that it makes no sense whatsoever) and I (as the stupid fucking moron I am) posted it on Instagram Stories - to later fucking trying to follow him on Instagram. 

&amp;#x200B;

Guess who fucking saw the story. Him. Yes.

So now I am blocked from trying to follow him on Instagram and I'm never showing my face at that store ever again.

This was soooo long I'm sorry but thanks you if you read it all.

tifu,"So this happened a few days ago

I work as a barista for a local coffee shop

On Friday we had a new staff member starting her first shift as a waitress (said she had coffee skills as well so it was waitress and barista). She starts at 8.30 with one of the bosses and throughout the day shows alot of enthusiasm and commitment to the job which she just started and the boss thought she was amazing. She was under the impression that her job involved all these awesome perks such as annual leave as part time but the bosses never explained this. 

At the end of the day, the boss leaves at about 3 for the end of her shift, so the rest of the staff start talking about things like who to look out for/who not to trust (other staff), and the more interesting topics such as money and pay, annual leave, tips etc. Because you need to look out for your staff members and if they ask then I answer the question. I wasn't alone, I had another staff member with me so they answered the question too. And just to add in, we weren't trying to scare her away or anything. We were more informing her that this place wasn't the best in terms of legalities and that she should be made aware of it at the start rather than months in like the rest of us. There are some perks but we would prefer proper pay over these perks. 

After the new staff member found out how dodgey the place was (no tips, no weekend rate, $5 extra on public holidays rather than double time, no annual leave-which she thought came with the part time job and not just full time, bad pay rate, some creepy workers) she said that ""well I don't want to work for another f*ckin dodgey cafe, I have already been through heaps of them just so I can have a good job. Goodluck guys"". She takes her apron off and then walks out for which I don't think she will return ever. 

The other worker and I were in literal shock because of the abruptness of her actions and that we'd never seen anyone do that before. 

I feel like by me and another staff member answering the questions she had, drove to quitting on the first day. The bosses don't know yet I don't think and if they know they hadn't told us or let on about it and they needed a new staff member to cover another who is going on holidays next week and won't be back for a month or so. 

I just want to reiterate that this was never my intention for her to quit first day because all I did was answer her questions which she brought up herself. But I do feel a part in her leaving on the same day.

tifu,"This actually happened a little over two years ago, but I felt it was worth sharing so let's start. So rewind back to summer of 2017... I had just graduated high school and was waiting to ship out for basic training. I had also had a girl who's name was Madison, that I was messing around with kinda dating/ fuck buddy it was complicated. Anyways, I had just gotten off of work at the time I was working at Texas Roadhouse (Place is good as fuck to eat) and had gotten a text from her to sneak into her house and ""hangout"". As the dumb fuck I was, I thought it was a good idea because I figured obviously her parents must've be gone for a few days or something. I didn't have a car at the time either and I was driving my dad's work truck to get back and forth. Now here's where my inevitable faith begins. Her house is about 30 minutes away from my Job, and she lives in a well off neighborhood which also made me think damn a random ass hispanic guy, cruising through a rich white neighborhood at like 12 in the morning there's bound to be a cop just surveilling the area. But thankfully there wasn't \*sigh of relief\* she told me also, to park a few houses down so it didn't look suspicious or anything so I did. I get there and I knock on the door big mistake.... I get a call IMMEDIATELY from her saying,  ""hide my parents are here!!"" in my head I'm thinking that would've been useful information, but I hid on the side of the house and heard her dad open the door saying hello looking around then shutting the door. At this point, you'd assume I get back in the truck and go the fuck home right? nah, only fullsenders here. She texted me to come to her window and come in through there which I did. Now we are in here room chilling watching bob burgers, one thing led to another and I'm breaking her back while also having to shove her mouth with my shirt to keep her quiet. Now at the time we are just chilling on her bed looking and laughing at meme's, and I guess we were being a little too loud next thing I know I'm hearing straight banging on her door it's her dad saying to open the door NOW. I'm panicking and I only have boxers on, and at this point my body is going through a fight or flight mode and I just jump out the window, jump over 6 wooden fences while getting chased and barked at by some annoying ass Chihuahua mid-way running through one of these backyards. I finally stop on the side of someones house then that's when I realized. Fuck. I'm literally in my boxers, my clothes, phone, wallet, and keys are still in her room... Gawd, if ya listening... HELP! I hear her dad now screaming in the distance ""come out you piece of shit where the fuck are you"" while hearing a gun getting cocked back in the distance. I'm thinking to myself wow I'm so fucked this guy is going to call the police, my parents are going to find out about this shit, and I'm probably not shipping out too basic training now. I waited at the side of these people's house what felt like an eternity, then finally had the balls to just accept my faith and try to sneak back to her house back to her window to retrieve my stuff so I can get out of there. I walk to the street on the otherside of where her house is, trying to see if anybody is going to be at the door, and it looked good but as I walked into their front yard the damn mom opened the door and just gave me this look I won't ever forget asking me, do you want to explain yourself? it feels like I'm on dateline NBC or something having cameras watch me at every angle. So there I am, nothing but boxers looking at her mom, while her dad that looks like a fucking leprechaun totting what looks like a little .380, and Madison in the back crying. I pretty much tell her no shit, It's not what it looks like. Then she pretty much rambles about why would I sneak into their house, how I knew her, and what my name was I gave her some fake ass name saying my name was ""Javier"" and told her I knew her from the other high school, which was true. I'm just waiting at this point for the police or some shit to show up, and to explain to my parents why I'm always so fucked. But from the miracle of god, they told me to leave, and never come back and Madison came up to me with all my shit crying saying she was sorry blah blah blah. As soon as I got my shit I ran to the truck and hauled ass out of there. I ended up catching up with her after I graduated basic training, and she pretty much told me she was on lockdown for months and her parents went through all her social media, pictures found her nudes as well which must've been awkward as hell, and couldn't do anything after that incident which I felt kind of bad, because I ruined her life for that whole time but I was like fuck it least I made it out alive.

tifu,"Maybe this isn't a major fuck up, but it was definitely a fuckup I will never forget as a gamer.

So there's this popular game called CS:GO, where you play in a 5 man team and try to kill the other team or complete certain objectives. It is definitely a competitive game, and I'm also a try hard at this game.

I start playing the game in the morning, and queue into comp games. What I didn't realize is that my headphone has it's mic muted since last night, and since it's always on before, I didn't worry so much about it, didn't check the light, etc.

Now in the game there is a function called push to talk, so I push the side button of my mouse, and people can hear me. It also displays an icon bottom left, so seeing the icon I'm assured that teammates can hear me, but in reality my mic is off, while the icon is still showing nonetheless.

So I ended up talking for a whole afternoon, trying to communicate to my teammates, not realizing that they didn't hear anything I said, which explains why sometimes I say ""Let's go B"" and everyone goes A, or ""I hear someone in CT spawn"" but teammate still watches long A. 

This ptobably caused me to lose one game when we would've won if I communicated better.

&gt;  
&gt;Theres  this other mom at my daughters daycare, and she is hot to trot. She  looks like a buff version of morena baccarin (sp?) and to top it off  shes super cool and fun to talk to.

&gt;  
&gt;Well  I recently had a pretty drastic schedule change at work and my husband  became the primary daycare drop off/pick up for about 2 weeks while we  all adjusted. Things settled down and I was able to start being the  primary again, and a few days ago I saw hotpants lady- she was still her  beautiful self, but had put on about 50lbs- I was astonished, she was  always ultra fit, how on earth did she do that in 2 weeks? To top it off  when I said hi the first morning I was back she barely made eye contact  with me and just gave me a half smile and curt nod. I asked my husband  if he noticed the change and he said he just thought maybe her recent  switch from workout clothes to big dresses were making her look bigger.  Maybe? No, she was definitely more voluminous. I spent 2 more days  trying to catch her eye and facing chilly disposition and I finally  decided to try and reinitiate friendly conversation with her.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me:  ""Hey, I haven't been here for a while, good to see you again! You been  feeling ok?"" Her: ""Oh, yeah, but I haven't been here in months."" Me:  (not catching on) ""Oh? Haha, everything is such a blur with kids, I  never know what day it is anymore"" Her: ""I suppose, but I wouldn't know,  I only watch my nephew when my sister is out of town."" Me: (realization  hitting like a thunder clap) ""oh, OH! So you're..."" Her: angrilly  interupting ""Yes, I'm the fat twin. I've seen you staring at me trying  to figure that out.""

tifu,"Happened over 25 years ago when my little brother was born and I was 3 or so. For some reason this memory came up and I just spoke to my dad about it and he confirmed that I wasn’t dreaming this and that it actually happened. 

I don’t really remember of there were complications or anything, but my mother and brother had to stay in the hospital for a while after he was born, so I’m assuming there were. 

Anyway, it was just me and my dad that would pop by the hospital to visit my mum and on the day my mum and brother was to be discharged, my dad bought some really really expensive chocolate for my mum and a cheaper box of chocolate to give the staff. Me being a kid, he said that I could have 1 or 2 if I wanted, but to eat the cheaper chocolate. 

So we go to the hospital, and my dad had to go into a room with some staff and I have to wait in the waiting area with a nurse for some reason and I used that as my opportunity to open the cheap box of chocolates to eat exactly 2 and start my chocolate distribution shift. I remember this sense of joy I felt by making everyone happy with a chocolate and I sort of forgot what my dad said. Soon, I ran out of chocolate but remembered the other box. I ended up handing it out to all the staff and even to some of the people waiting. 

Then my dad shows up and said “alright you can come in. Don’t forget the chocolates!” 

I tell my father that I already handed them out with a big grin. 

Well, turns out that I handed out chocolates to a completely different department and not only did the staff looking after my mum get nothing, my dad was a bit furious that I gave away really expensive chocolate meant for my mother to all of these strangers in the waiting room.

tifu,"Some MAJOR drama popped off at the salon I own, today. 

Backstory: when I bought the salon, they had a water delivery service set up and I met the guy, switched the account into my name, and we’ve been happily together for a year now. I have dudes cell phone # and when I need water I call or text, and he always comes through. Very nice guy. 

A while back, we were almost out of water and I saw the water truck pull up out front. I ran out and he was heading into the shop next door (with whom I share the water guy) and I didn’t recognize this driver but I shouted out “hey! We need water too! Come over after!” 
Guy comes in a little later and says “I’m not your water company. But do you need water?” 
And I was like “oh, shoot. I didn’t realize. I’m sorry. It’s okay.” 
So he left but then he came back in with FREE jug of water and his business card. He said to try the sample and, to call if I wanted better, less expensive water. He was SUPER nice!

So, I was conflicted and thought maybe I could just order water from both places because they are both really nice, and I don’t want to disappoint either one. 

Then a week ago we were 100% out of water. Called my usual guy and he couldn’t come for a couple days. So I called new water guy and he was like “we’ll be there in about 30 minutes.” Showed up, saved the day, and set up an account for me. 

I didn’t know how to handle it, so I just ignored it, as ya do, and then yesterday, the shop next door dropped off 2 jugs from water guy #1. He had left them with him for us when he made his stop to our area. So I made a face like this - 😬 - and moved the jugs to the back. “No big deal... we’ll just order from both places” I told myself, as my pulse raced and beads of sweat started forming at my brow...

Today, original water guy comes BURSTING through the door, and says “I’m here to get your empties! And good news - your neighbor said I can leave your water with them whenever you need, so it’s all good!” 

I laughed nervously, and tried to stand between him and the back room. I said “I’ll just go grab those empties then.” And started walking that way. And then, he followed me. So I walked with purpose, trying to get the empties and give them to him before he started looking around at stuff. And then from behind me I heard him shout, incredulously “WHAT IS *THAT* BOTTLE DOING HERE??!?” 
I froze where I stood. I grabbed the empties and turned toward him and, before I could reply, he said “oh. Is that a free sample?” 
And so I made this face - 😳 - and nodded my head yes. 
And then he said “oh, haha, yeah - I always say take freebies when you get ‘em.” And I was like - 😰 “uh huh.” And then he turned to me like - 🧐 ”YOURE NOT SWITCHING TO THEM, RIGHT?” 
And I was like 😶😶😶 And I SHOOK MY FUCKING HEAD NO.

Now to the story at hand. A last week I (finally) started to notice that I wasn't hearing completely well, so earlier this week I decide to go to the nurse at my office and have my ears checked. Immediately she sees the problem, I have lots of ear wax obstructing my ear canal. She recommends me to apply glycerin for a couple of days to soften the ear wax and then get an ear wash.

I proceed that way, and last night my girlfriend washed my ears. After applying lots of water the ear wax starts to come out and I suddenly start to hear EVERYTHING. I haven't heard this clearly in years. I'm excited I want to listen to my favorite music again and rediscover what I have been missing, I can't wait to listen to the birds in all their glory again.

Now, here comes the FU: my girlfriend starts speaking and she has a high pitch in her voice I had never noticed. I realize that's how she speaks, is just that I have never noticed due to ear wax. I don't know who I live with anymore :'(

Anyways last night we are again doing our routine (on a Friday night we are so cool I know) at Sniper Elite 4 (I had more kills btw) before it turned 11 PM and he wanted to go to sleep.  I still had energy and hit Netflix up to see a new season of Black Mirror released.  I'm watching the episode ""Striking Vipers"" and low and behold - it is about two male old college roommates who now only see each other in person **once a year** and try to reconnect by playing a virtual video game (an updated version of one they played together back in school).  I instantly message my friend and tell him he has to watch the episode as it is ""exactly like us.""  As I continue to watch, the two ex-roommates play a fighting game with one of their favorite characters is female and the other is male and EARLY SPOILER: it suddenly turns sexual between them.  I haven't heard from my friend yet and am feeling so embarrassed.

tifu,"So this just happened about 2 hours ago, and I’m still recovering from my failure. 

I used to practice and play golf during middle school pretty seriously but stopped before high school. Fast forward a few years of never touching a golf club to today, my family decides to go to top golf for fun and guess who decided to try and be a show-off. Now, you may be thinking “oh, you must’ve chipped the ball sideways and ricocheted off the dispenser. That could happen to anyone.” Wrong. I try and do a full power swing, miss the ball completely, lose my grip on club, and let it sail behind me towards the hostess who just left us. Luckily, it misses her head but to make matters worse, the club hits the ceiling and makes a huge dent. I straight up ask to leave out of embarrassment and will probably not golf again for awhile.

tldr: Almost hit someone playing golf not with the ball but with a full swing club. Also, probably on the top golf watchlist.",TIFU by almost killing our topgolf hostess
tifu,"This didn’t happen today of course, but around 2012 when I was about age 13. 

Me and my family went on a skiing/snowboarding holiday in Morzine, France, which is close to the boarder of Switzerland. 

We were staying with an old family friend who had been living in France for a few years and had picked up a decent amount of the language. 

He offered to teach us how to snowboard; much to my disappointment because i wanted to skii instead. However, I begrudgingly agreed as my parents were very keen. 

I tried to learn how to snowboard, and tried to go down a few slopes (quite half-hartedly because i’m scared of heights) and being an angsty thirteen year old, I got frustrated and gave up after a few hours as i was more interested in texting my crush back home. 

This is where my fuck up happened. 

Being completely oblivious to my surroundings, and it being my first time at a skii slope, i decided for some stupid ass reason to sit at the top of a small slope to take off my snowboard. 

What I didn’t realise until AFTER losing grip of my snowboard and watching it slide halfway down the slope, was that there was a very small baby inside a baby basket AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE, DIRECTLY IN THE FIRNG LINE OF MY SNOWBOARD. 

It hit the baby basket directly and knocked it over. It happened so fast, there was no way i would’ve gotten there in time to stop it, so i just stood and watched with extreme dread building every second.  

I stood staring down at the bottom of the slope as the baby’s mother had an absolute meltdown and started screaming at me in French. I absolutely despise confrontation and was happy I couldn’t understand what she was saying to me. Luckily, my family friend came
over to her and tried to calm her down in French. I don’t know what i would’ve done without him. 

After that, I left immediately and barely did any snowboarding for the rest of the trip.

tifu,"I visited my parents house with my girlfriend today, and all was going well.

She has met my girlfriend before and she’s very fond of her, and I feel so happy knowing my mother approves my girlfriend so this is an extra perk into the relationship.

We arrived at midday today, and we were just chilling; eating and chatting away. My girlfriend was sat next to me on the couch and she pushed up against me, rested her ever so perfect head into my shoulder and she closed her eyes whilst I was admiring the beauty.

Anyway, I needed the toilet so I shrugged my girlfriend off of me and she woke up. I went upstairs to drain the pipe and as I descended downstairs my girlfriend was making her way upstairs. She began kissing me, and squeezed my upper thigh - getting awfully close to my dingaling and this made me very excited yet so sexually frustrated. She quickly ascended upstairs before I could retaliate in a dirty, flirty manner.

Still in the mood I am, full of excitement and sexual anger, I wander into the kitchen. I stand there and notice my mother is leaning over the counter with her ass in the air whilst she’s making a phone call.

I don’t have a clue what came over me but I slapped my mothers ass, thinking she was my girlfriend. I didn’t view her as my girlfriend, but I was so caught up in the habit of slapping my girlfriend’s ass (and being so sexually frustrated) I just automatically assumed that the nearest available ass waiting to be slapped was my girlfriend’s. My mother quickly down around, stared at me whilst I shamefully looked at her back. She asked “what on Earth was that?” And I looked at her in the eyes, didn’t move and just muttered “I was thinking the exact same thing”....

Somehow I started climbing stairs and I tried to open an apartment door which wouldn't open while I am still engrossed in my phone. I tried harder and it would open. Now I kept my phone in pocket and reinserted the key and tried harder again but in vain. I look up and see that the apartment number is 2495 instead of 2445. Out of panic, I started walking away from the apartment and the door opened. It was 1 AM in the night, and to top it a guy opened the door while I was trying to get out of it. He simply stared at me while I was blabbering apologizing and what not. Most awkward moment I have ever had! :D

tifu,"This just happened an hour ago. TL;DR at the bottom

&amp;#x200B;

Some background:

I adopted a dog a few months ago and found out shortly after that she has a skin condition that requires weekly baths with medicated shampoo. I just as quickly discovered that she is terrified of getting wet, from not going out in the rain, to not urinating on the grass if it is wet. As for the baths though I try to make it as comfortable for her as possible with treats and pets a flowing as I work in the shampoo.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a yard so I bathe her in the bathtub and dog paws aren't made to get traction on wet bathtubs so I got a bath mat to give her a little more traction. After the bath the mat catches most of her dropped fur so I take it out and wash it and then hang it up or put it back in the tub until. I hung up the bath mat after her last bath and never put it back down so before filling up the bath I plopped it down and halfheartedly stamped it to get the suction cups to take.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we were ready to get wet. I coaxed her in and gave her some treats as I turned the water on and we got to the lathering.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have in house laundry so I don't want to get too many clothing articles wet and have to deal with them after so I normally give her baths wearing gym shorts or swim trunks and that is it. This time it was a bit baggier than normal gym short.

&amp;#x200B;

She got all lathered up and was enjoying the full body rubs she was getting but when rinsing time came I saw the dread set in her eyes. The waters was on and the tub was slowly filling up as I tried to keep her calm. I noticed that the corner of the bath mat was coming up but didn't think anything of it as we were almost done.

I took a cup and poured some water over her back and she recoiled, moving so her paw was off the bath mat and then proceeded to slip so she was on her back/side. She was only laying in an inch or so of water and is not a small dog (\~50 lbs) but she was not having it and began gasping and flailing.

&amp;#x200B;

I attempted to help her up from outside the tub but she wasn't having it so I stepped in the tub and bent down over her to help her up. In a second, one her flailing hind legs found its way up my shorts and found my squatting nether regions. She got a good scratch from taint to asshole. I may have been bleeding from places I wouldn't enjoy, but it wasn't her fault, so she got up, got rinsed and got her post bath treats. She did however get her nails clipped after.

tifu," 

Some important background information - I’m in a very happy relationship and I have no hard feelings towards my ex boyfriend. I also have no negativity towards his current girlfriend and I wish the best for them. 

So earlier that week I was taking out the trash. My dog was inside and I didn’t want him to run outside so I quickly slammed the door on my left middle finger. I’m a classical pianist so I was immediately scared for the worst, but it wasn’t broken or anything. The doctor told me to keep it wrapped up in a bandage whenever I played. It became a bit of a nuisance because it made my middle finger protrude upward more than the others, but in the grand scheme of life I was just happy it wasn’t broken.  

Flash forward to about a week after the incident: I am in my car driving home from hanging out with some friends, and on my way to go practice (The finger’s wrapped). There’s heavy traffic and I’m resting my head on my left hand with my right hand on the steering wheel. Completely oblivious to what anyone around me is observing I have my mutilated middle finger sticking up the slightest bit out of my window. 

I turn into the parking lot of where I was going and I quickly glance at the car that was behind me. LO AND BEHOLD it was my ex and his girlfriend and it appears that she is angrily flipping me off. At first I’m confused but realize this was merely in response to MY FINGER. I was mortified and realized I would never get the chance to go about apologizing or explaining what had happened so I just had to let it go. . . oops

Since I live an hour away from the uni and since it was getting pretty dark around 4:30/5:30  I decided to stop going in , this isn't usually my style but I'm a women so harder to defend myself from weirdos and  I'd  be on public transport for an hour , in the dark , without friends every week.

The lecturer basically just read off the slides anyway so I figured it would be easy to keep up.

But, becauce uni is uni things get busy and I fell behind. 

Now I have exams. 5 of them.
While the others might be okay(I attended) I'm worried about this one.

It has multiple choice, short answer and an essay question. I havnt properly learn this unit at all. 
Sure it's not hard content wise (it's on crime prevention, I'd be dead if I was science) but I only have a few days to get it all down packed. And with an essay question I can't role the dice with guess work.

On the plus side I only need 30% to pass, but man am I regretting not sucking it up and going in.

Any advice ?

luckily he gave us a PDF of what the exam was basically on.
So I'll make palm cards out of that and the two quizzes , sadly no past exams to study.

I can't start today since my hardest exams are first. I can start Wednesday. I do have another exam due the day after this one but I have passed the unit already (still want to do well though so I'm not gonna ignore it)

tifu,"Hiya y'all, 

I'm new to reddit and discovered this wonderful haven  and decided to add my own tidbit. :D


This all happened my senior year of college. It was a Saturday night in the middle of November between  the end of midterms but before the start of finals/project. I and my gang of friends just finished attending a musical that some mutual acquaintances at our university were a part of. 

The day had been going swell. We started with games (a contentious game of smash/Mario kart) followed by some other celebrations in preparation of the scheduled show, and now were the afterparties that followed. At this point however, my friend and I were itching to smoke a couple of  joints I had prepared to enjoy once the show was over and the gang was to meet up back at our suite (a 4 person suite with personal rooms/bathrooms). Given the size of people (approx. 7), we decided that everyone except myself and this friend were going to catch a ride back while we took a back route to smoke.

Now, our university was in a state were weed wasn't legalized so we decided to take the back route where there were no lights and through a small forested area that gave a short cut to the suite. Needless to say, we were high as the sky once we got back and wanted to get some food.

This is where the story gets interesting. There are three facts you need to know:

1) It was around 9 PM in the fall so it was pitch dark outside and no one was outside

2) The popular college sub shop was about a 15 min. brisk walk from my place/suite.

3)  Both the suite and sub shop was in a very dangerous part of town (ie:shootings, gang fights, etc... you know....)

So, my buddy and I grab our coats, wallets, phones and head out. Although I was as high as the sky, I can still see/comprehend enough of my surroundings to be functional. Thus, once I noticed this rather tall ( ~6ft 2) black man with gangster like clothes (sagged ripped jeans, large droopy hoodie, etc...) take notice of us ( I a small 5ft 4 Asian male and a lanky 5ft 8 white male), cross the street, and starts walking uncomfortably close behind us ( let's say close enough for him to reach out and grab me). 

Now, 4 things that ensued have me convinced that this guy wanted to rob us, which was sadly a common occurrence at our university for students living at my suite building complex.

1) At first, I thought I was just paranoid so I just started to walk faster since I know I could be walking at a slow pace because I was so stoned. NOPE, this fella kept pace with us the whole damn time.

2) The guy was muttering something under his breath, loud enough for me to hear, and pointing to something in his waist. I ,being a super-stoned moron, didnt understand what he could be saying and just kept walking whilst still taking the occasional glance backwards.

3) This dude did 1) and 2) for the WHOLE TIME it took to get to the sub shop where there were turns cross walks (thankfully we got luck with all the walk signals)

4) He walks in with us( at this point he was standing right behind us before the entrance), enters with us, we dart to the side to sit down while he crosses the room slams his hands on the counter and walks straight out. A few minutes after we place our orders, I shit u not, a crap ton of  police sirens converge a block down.

What do y'all think happened? To this day, I am not sure. I just like to think I got lucky I was so stoned. :P

tifu,"First let me say that I had rarely masturbated dry and I believe everyone who enjoys doing so deserves a special place in hell! Seriously.

That day I did not have lubricant. I was also under the impression (from the dudes here on reddit) that most people don't use lube so they had me wondering how the fuck do people even enjoy that. So I went on and did my thing but I couldn't make myself come. Only after an hour and a half that I finally did ejaculate, and it didn't feel any good. I could feel my penis being sore after all the force and pressure that I had applied frustratingly trying to make myself come, but nothing serious. Later during the day when I went to pee I was shocked by the sight of my penis. It looked seriously damaged. The skin was shrunk / super tight / extremely ""wrinkled"" as if I had it sit and on a charcoal grill and part of it was swollen too.

The good news: It healed back within a couple days.

The bad news: There is still something seriously wrong with it. When it's half-erect it always looks like a fucking hourglass! (narrow in the middle, as if there's a tight phantom ring placed around the middle part) and it stays like that until it is fully erect.

IDK what to do about this and I'm too embarrassed to ask my doctor.

This morning (few weeks ago) I had a Piano lesson. After waking up, eventho it was already late I decided to go for a quick wank which turned out not to be as quick as I had hoped- suddenly I had no time for breakfast left and was actually running late for the bus. 
Unfortunately this bus doesn’t stop in front of my door but 15 minutes by foot away. So I ran all the way and was actually able to get it just before it left.
When I arrived at the piano lesson my teacher and I talked about a certain piece of music and he wanted to show me the sheet on his iPad. He did however completely forget that he had used it for porn earlier. When he unlocked his Tablet, we both looked at pornhub for half second and then I immediately looked very interested at the piano and he pulled the iPad away trying to keep talking about the music. We then proceeded the lesson but yeah, I learned about time management and he learned about clearing his browser.

tifu,"So... I (M) started my day off great. I woke up and I was instantly in a great mood. I made my bed and decided it was time for a shower.

I jumped into the shower and I rinsed my hair. Whilst I was under the shower and had my eyes closed, I reached to my right and grabbed, what I thought, was shampoo. I opened the bottle, squirted it into my hands and began massaging it into my hair and scalp...

I rinsed it off and wondered why on Earth my hair felt like a horse’s tail. You know the brittleness, and the dryness. Anyhow, I began washing the rest of my body and exited the shower. 

As I was drying my hair I couldn’t help but wonder why my hair didn’t feel clean, and why it had a strange aroma to it. I looked in the mirror, and realised my hair  at this point looked like it belonged in a back of beef jerky. It stank, and just felt absolutely horrendous. To my amazement as I looked across to the shelf in the shower, I noticed that a particular bottle of interest had sud marks around it; implying that I had used it... 

The other shampoo bottles were bone dry, and realisation hit me... I had used vagisil as a shampoo and it left my hair absolutely rotten.

Now, at first I couldn’t work out what it was. The prefix “**vag**” rang a few alarm bells in my head, but I just thought it was one of them catchy pre/suffixes to use. Kinda like And-rex and Du-rex... one wipes shit off your ass, the other stops spunk from impregnating your missus.

I walked downstairs and asked my mother what on Earth is vagisil... the look of both horror and amusement answered my prayers

tifu,"Obligatory 'this actually happened a while ago,' last Christmas to be exact.

So I have pretty bad anxiety. I used to drink pretty heavily to get  through the day but it was negatively affecting my social life so I went  to get some help. I asked a local doctor to prescribe me some pills. I forget the name now but apparently they double as sleeping pills. Anyway, I assume my drinking had given me a high tolerance for things like that because they didn't work and I  started having severe panic attacks again.  
I upped my dosage from the prescribed 1 pill a day to about 10 or more. I visited multiple doctors and asked them all to give me the same pills and bought them from different pharmacies. Towards the end of the year, I went back  home and talked to my family doctor who has been treating me for going on 20 years now. He told me I needed to stop taking them as they put me at risk of heart failure, being from a family with a history of heart disease I said ""Ok, they don't  work so, whatever."" 

**Here's the fuck-up pt.1:**  
I didn't listen to the doc's advice to slowly wind down the amount I was taking. They didn't work anyway so I chucked what I had left in the bin.   
That night I head to an open-bar party to say goodbye  to some friends of mine as I had a short flight in the morning and was spending Christmas with fam. Cut to the morning and I'm sitting in a hot departure lounge knowing full well that mother of all hangovers was creeping up on my still-drunk-from-the-night-before ass.  
The flight is delayed,  first by an hour, then by 3 hours, then by 5 hours. I waited 14 hours for my flight (The local airline was disgustingly incompetent and  flat-out lied to us but that's another story). I spent the day throwing  up, sweating, sipping water and generally wishing I were dead.   
Anyway, 15 hours later I arrive at the motel where we're staying. Everyone is beat and we turn it for the night.  
Not  me though. I'm fucking WIRED. I can't even keep my eyes shut. So I  spent the night watching documentaries and nursing my hungover ass back to health.  
Day 2 goes by, I can't really remember what I did or where I went that day.  
Night  2. I still can't sleep and I'm starting to panic a little. I move my  bed to the patio (it was raining with a warm breeze aka. perfect snooze weather). I drink some herbal tea. I put on some sleepy music. NOTHING WORKS.  
Day 3 comes and goes. Apparently I was really energetic, loud and chatty. No memory of the events.

**The fuck up pt.2:**  
Night  3. I haven't slept in like 70+ hours. I'm panicking and half crying,  pacing back and forth in the lounge. I'm convinced that this is the  point where I start losing my mind, this is NOT good and I have to do SOMETHING.  
I wake up my parent's and causally ask for some sleeping pills. Not just one, I need a LOT. They ask me what's wrong and I play it  cool. They don't buy it though, I got pretty annoyed when my ma insisted I only needed 2 at most.  
I take the 2 she gave me, go outside and try sleep.  
The  sleeping pills don't work. My brain is now geared to function adequately when dosed with enough anxiety pills to put gaggle of  pensioners into a deep coma.  
Now I'm half awake and half asleep. One  second I'm laughing my ass off, the next second I'm begging my ma (who had come out to see what was going on) to wake me if I start  choking on my own tongue. I'm also starting to hallucinate.  
5 minutes later and whole family is now up to watch their youngest suffer a full-blown mental meltdown.  
My mum is lying next to me, facing me. My sister is massaging my head. My dad is standing in the corner looking disappointed.  
It  was as I slowly slipped into unconsciousness that my delirious-ass  brain convinced itself that I was not on vacation with my family but rather, snug in bed with my ex-gf next to me holding my hand. You can see where this is going.  
I gave my mum-girlfriend a passionate goodnight kiss, there was tongue involved.  
I  hear a gasp and am startled awake. The disgusted look on my sister's  face is the only thing I can remember clearly from those three days. The rest I piece together in the following weeks.

My  family was pretty cool about it. No-one has mentioned it beyond asking if I was OK after eventually passing out. I think they're smart enough to know what was happening to me and the fact that I didn't know where/who I was etc.

tifu,"Let me paint a picture, this was last night at shut-down.

It's 4:58, two minutes before I can officially leave and three minutes after I'm allowed to start turning people away. I'm literally sealing the deposit-drop bag for the week.  
On the last screen for closing out the distribution system for the day. It's a screen that asks you a whole-bunch of deposit crap to put it in the system.  
Have all the lights turned off.  
Have all the doors besides one locked. I'm suppose to lock *all* the doors when I start shutting down so no one can walk in... but the locks are very heavy and hurt my fingers to unlock from the inside. (Yes, I'm a total ass wuss) This is the door I plan on leaving through.  
The register was open and emptied; all the money and checks from the week are thrown about the table in my furious attempts to manually-count and get out at a decent time.... And for some reason, in-comes ~~&lt;Redacted&gt;~~ and Co, Construction...  
They look at the building. See the tights off, the empty registers through the window, the sign flipped to 'closed' and decide their best course of action is obviously to proceed to go ahead and pull on the locked door anyways! *Of-course.*  
They all look at each-other when it doesn't open --instead of taking the hint... they go for the next locked door... and the next door... and then proceed to try the unlocked door. ***Phoosh, magic.*** *They make it in.*  


So &lt;Redacted&gt; and the three guys he brought don't speak more than a lick of English between the four of them; My Spanish is even worth than that. And as it turns out, when you get to the deposit-check screen... the back/cancel button stops working. In fact! ANY button press apparently goes ahead and gives the system the go-ahead to shut right the fuck down... and so I start panicking immediately when I press back and it closes-down, as one does.They start grabbing stuff, start trying to set up future-deliveries with the few phrases and forms them know how to say/read. And they're just getting more and more confused and upset that I won't just hand them over the order they called in earlier and I just simply don't have the Spanish to explain I can't remove inventory with my system down...

Of course I can't stop panicking to actually think. I start breaking out into a cold sweat... this is maybe up there in top-ten of things I never want to happen, as I've got *~~just the best~~* social anxiety, and man, is this a lot of triggers.

Call my friend who closes at another location-- asleep, no answer. Call my boss who has already left for the day-- tells me to just start it back up with a day of only fifteen minutes. Hang up with him and *great, our pos system has a fraud-prevention that won't let you start a new day within four hours of the old one's closing.* At this point I'm too nervous and embarrassed to call my manager back; I'm interrupting him with his family at dinner time.

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever... I can handle it right? I open tomorrow and they have a tab on their account. I can write everything they grabbed down and just handed them the product and say ""Have a nice day! All done!"" because I'll just charge it all to their tab in the morning; no one has to know... So that's what I do! I just write it down and pray (I am only religious in moments as such.)And then I hear it as their walking out... the  ""&lt;Spanish Spanish Spanish&gt; hey wait. Receipt?"" of one of his guys... He turns right around and while I'm shaking in my boots asks why I don't have a receipt for his contractor this time --in surprisingly perfect English. &gt;Fuck &gt;Fuck &gt;Fuck &gt;Fuck

The receipt the computer gives... you know... *When you actually make a sale.*

I'm not really sure how it got resolved. I just eventually stressed the computer was down every way I could while my uniform got soaked in sweat and some one understand finally.

tifu,"I was on my way to the store a little while after it had gotten dark. I was driving through a suburban neighborhood with few bus stops outside the main center of town. I was passing by a house with a large white fence when I saw two shadows close together. As I got closer, I saw one large man pinning a shorter man up against the fence. My first thought was that this guy was getting mugged and I was the only one there who could stop it. 

I don’t know why I thought this, I’m a scrawny lady and I’m definitely not strong but, adrenaline took over. It was dark, there was nobody around, and I felt like I HAD to do something if someone was in danger. 

So, I drove past, banged a U turn and pulled up across the street from the men. I locked my doors and rolled down the window. I had my phone in hand and was about to yell “STOP WHAT YOU’RE DOING I’M CALLING THE POLICE!” when suddenly, I realized they were lovers sharing a very passionate kiss before the bus arrived. 

I rolled my window up and drove the hell out of there in relief as my adrenaline drained. I was so relieved that it was a loving couple and not what I previously feared. But then it hit me, what if I screamed that!? I’d be the biggest asshole in town. I also must’ve looked like the biggest CREEP driving by, whipping around and stopping my car to watch them, WITH MY PHONE OUT.

So the fuckup happened an hour ago but the story starts 2 days ago. 

A few months ago I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years. This week is the first week I’m feeling ready to start trying to find someone new to canoodle with. So I do what every horny teenager does and downloaded tinder. I’ve heard a lot of horror stories but I just decided to say screw it. Well that first night I got 10 matchs. I was flabbergasted. I start talking to a few of them and this girl starts really coming on to me. We start texting and one things leads to another and she initiated a sexy fun time chat over text. I was very surprised but surprisingly okay with it. This morning she texted me asking if I want to meet up when she got off work tonight. Knowing where this was leading I eagerly said yes. So I met her in person from the first time when I picked her up from work around 11:30 tonight. We go somewhere and hop in the back seat. Now this girl is very awkward and even texting her is kinda weird. That was nothing compared to trying to do the deed. We were making out and she just like wouldn’t use tounge and kept pulling away but would get mad when I would stop fondling her breasts to figure out why she was pulling away. She also told me when I started trying to move things south of the belt that it was her time of the month. That’s no biggie but she got really weird when she stopped me and told me I didn’t want to do that because of that and I didn’t freak out. After that she set a timer because she had to be home around a certain time and started getting handsy with me. Shit felt amazing and I haven’t been touched like that in many moons. She was kind of laying down in my back seat and started repositioning to what I thought was going to be a better position for some head. I was hyped. Until she just payed her head down on my thigh while she jerked me off. Except we never got to the end because her timer went off. She promises some stuff over Snapchat later to make up for leaving me with blue balls. I take her home and head home. While I’m driving home she’s talking about how hot what we did was and how she can’t wait do it again. She is also saying stuff about how we need to call each other babe and stuff and doesn’t reply unless I end the message with babe or baby but she doesn’t want more than a fwb relationship. I get home and she’s trying to get me to send dick pics but I ain’t about that life (super non photogenic down there, but then again I guess all guys are) so I’m just like sending pics of my abs instead. She sent a few revealing pics and then got dressed again. I go to finish the job she started and get there pretty fast. This was the most painful nut I have ever had. Immedite splitting headache that still hasn’t gone away and I am still seeing triple of everything.  She asked me if I wanted to get together tomorrow to do a little more and me being in my post nut fog I stupidly agreed. Then found out neither of us have an empty house to use so she suggests finding a dressing room or public bathroom to use. And I agreed to that. What the fuck was I thinking? Now I have to figure out how to get out of this without hurting her feelings. And I need to learn to not get involved with crazy chicks.

&amp;#x200B;

So it starts out with me in math class and I had a good friend in that class, and the teacher was strict. Either way, we were about to take a test. We were sitting next to each so we were still in sight of each other and my friend decides to do this [pencil trick](https://youtu.be/Y-ah_zrxY9A?t=81). Now I and my trash brain were very amused by this and decided to do it back. We go back and forth a couple of times while trying to hold back our laughter, the teacher then fixes her eye on us and sees us do it a couple of times and she then gets our attention and tells us to stop. We stop for a brief 5 or so minutes and my friend does it one more time she then calls both of us over to her desk and tells us to stop or we will get a referral. We thought it was pretty funny and dumb that we would get a referral for doing black magic, we go it back to our seat to finish our quiz. I finish mine first so I stand up to go turn it in and my friend looks at my motioning the pencil trick under his nose and does it one last time. Well, the teacher lost it, she walked up and took the test out of my hand and went over to my friends and took his. She then called us up and gave a referral to both of us. We could barely contain our laughter walking out of the room. We eventually go to the counselor's office and wait for the counselor. Individually we get called into the counselor's office and I explained what happened and the counselor thinks its weird I got a referral. He laughs then says ""I don't know if this can go in your record my name."" I ask him if he was kidding and he said: ""No I'm not kidding this is pretty dumb and not worth the effort to make a report and punish you for it."" He then says ""Just don't annoy your teacher anymore."" I then say ""thanks"" and ask what will happen to my friend and he says ""depends on what he did"" and something else I can't really remember. I leave his office and give my friend a thumbs up and he looks confused and I say ""you'll do great!"" he laughs and goes into the office. I then walk back to class and to get my stuff. I walk in and look at my math teacher and she gives me an angry look and I look at her and say ""Yeah your referral didn't go through"" and I smirk. She says back: ""Oh really!?...I'll go talk to him about that."" I proceed to panic and just say ""Yeah oke"" and hustle out of the classroom. All of the next day and for the rest of that weekend I could only think about what she said. Low and behold I get to my first hour on the following Monday and I get called to the office along with my friend. We both know what it's about and are very curious as to what the counselor said. We sit down in his office and he lets out a sigh and he says ""You know a good criminal doesn't drive his stolen Lambo in front of a police department"" and proceeds to tell us how I told the math teacher about the referral not going through and how she stomped into his office and gave him a lecture about enforcing the rules and maintaining punishments. I specifically remember the Lambo line in detail. He then says ""I realize now I should punish you."" We both ask ""For what?"" and I shit you not he says ""For disrupting the class."" He tells us our punishments, my friend got 6 hours a.s.d and I got 3 hours. And the referral will go on our record. Safe to say I'm not doing that magic trick anymore.

So I was in Montreal with family for 2 weeks in summer and we were going to take flight home.

It was 3am in morning and we got an Uber to pick us up and take to airport, I was tired and when we got to the airport I was texting my friend and rushed out of the car with my luggage

Stupid me though I carry one of those zip wallets in my hand all the time and I put it on my lap in the car.

We got out and the car drove off when I thought where I left my wallet. And I realized I left it in the stupid Uber

tifu,"So this happened when I was a teenager, I'm 35 now and still regret it to this day.

I was in class and there was a cute guy that I was pretty good friends with in there too. We usually got along, except for today. You see being a typical teenage girl I wanted him to pay more attention to me then other people. That day he was ignoring me and kind of being a jerk. He yelled something at me, and I yelled back ""yea, well at least I never killed anyone!"" 

You see, years before he had been playing out in his yard with his brother and sister. They were playing with their Dads guns and not knowing they were loaded he fired one. At that exact time his little 5 year old sister was walking by and he shot her and killed her. 
She was my best friend in Kindergarten. 

After I said those words I was overcome with guilt I ran after him and apologized profusely. It took many months but he did eventually forgive me. 

Just a reminder to think before you talk, we all say things in anger and those words will follow us.

tifu,"Backstory: this happened about an hour ago at my friend’s house. My parents were at a fancy restaurant, and I didn’t know when exactly they would be home. 

My friend and I decide to be funny and start scooter-ing around in the street (there were no cars). I don’t have shoes on, but she does.

After a while of her on it, I took it and started riding around. After about 10 seconds, I start to feel this pain in my foot. I hear my friend’s voice from long ago, speaking her VERY IMPORTANT advice which I ignored:

“Don’t ride without shoes on. The metal on the scooter heats up, and it will burn your feet really bad!”

This next part happens in slow motion. I decide frantically that the best way to stop my foot from catching on fire was to (obviously) get off of the scooter. But I was too scared to just jump off, so I stuck my scorching-hot foot into the grass next to me and proceeded to roll around on some stranger’s lawn for a solid five seconds in pure agony. 

I emerge from my pain-filled haze to see a car slowing down on the road next to me. At this point, I was thinking, “Oh ok, so they saw me fall and they want to make sure that I’m ok. That’s nice of them.”

So I stand up. The car stops. The window rolls down. 

And there’s my father, looking right at me with anger and horror on his face, my mother in the passenger seat, complete disappointment in her eyes. 

They take in the scene: me, still on a stranger’s lawn, clutching my bare feet, an expression on my face of utter confusion. 

We left soon after that.

tifu,"For those who don't know - a Prince Albert is a genital piercing. On a man, it goes through the urethra and sits kind of at the base of the head, it usually does not get taken out because the piercing hole closes very quickly.

So my boyfriend, specifically, has a piercing that consists of two pieces. A ring and a ball. The ball can ""pop off"" to remove the ring if needed.

Last night we got home and things quickly got pretty hot and heavy. We take it to the bedroom, do the dirty and both of us end up kinda dozing off. I roll over to get comfy and feel something sharp poking me in my leg. I lift my leg and I see it there. My s/o's piercing. And it's sitting in a little puddle of blood.

I shake my s/o back awake and show him the piercing. He IMMEDIATELY freaks out, knowing the window to get the piercing back in without hurting himself is quite small. He gets it back in though, albeit with some pain. But it's back in.

But. The ball is missing. The ball keeps it in place. The ball being gone means the piercing will fall out again. I freak out because I can't find it and I assume that the ball is in me, presumably somewhere it definitely shouldn't be.

I run to the bathroom, go pee and nothing comes out. So I have to basically finger myself aggressively, but I'm still not finding it. I'm a little relieved, but at the same time, afraid because that means this little tiny ball may have ended up going through my cervix.

I go back to the bedroom, and my s/o is still looking for the ball, I tell him I can't find it in me, and he can't find it either. We agree to just put a smaller piercing in and we'll get a new ball in the morning.

He goes to the bathroom off the bedroom and starts going pee. We both hear it though, ""pi-tink-tink-tink!"" My s/o yells, looking up at me ""Found it! It was in my PEEN!""

We start CRACKING up, and he has to fish the ball out of the bottom of the toilet. But we still managed to find it so that's an absolute relief. It was a very long night for both of us.

TL;DR: S/O and I do the dirty, a part of his peener piercing goes missing after we finish and we assume it popped out in me. Luckily it wasn't in me, but instead it got lodged in my s/o's urethra.",TIFU by losing my s/o's Prince Albert piercing [NSFW]

I was surprised because she unfriended me years ago, and I never expected to see her on my feed again. May be worth noting that I don't have any feelings for her anymore, but it was a bit of a nasty break-up.

This catapulted me into nostalgic territory and so I decided to revisit our messages and remember exactly why we broke up. I was several hundred messages deep when I accidentally 'surprise' reacted to a message of hers.

I arrive at their place late in the pm close to 9. Me and my friend start talking about the wax and how strong the strain was. Cue his roommate coming in and asking what were up to that night. I told him ""smoking"" as I had already assumed my friend had told him. He was a little confused and looked at the dab pen to which my friend offered him a hit. He asked if it was similar to a vape pen just press the button and hold as you suck in. After a couple nods he took a hit, and within a few minutes he was in the clouds.

We all sat there enjoying the moment. He was having a blast. It wasn't till I got on the topic of weed that things took a turn for the worse.  He was curious so I told him about how a law was recently passed that allowed recreational use of weed starting next year. I then proceeded to tell him about how we could some all the wax without having to worry about any trouble. He then looked at the pen and asked us if what we had smoked had weed in it. Yep. 

My mind started to think maybe he had a drug test coming up or something. So we did the best that we could to assure him that it would be out of his system. He then started talking with himself in Korean and at this point I look over at my friend who looked at him and tried his best to calm him down. 

Turns out he is flying back to visit his family close to August and begins to tell us how they do random hair drug test at the Airport in S. Korea. He had never been selected but the possible chance of being selected freaked him out. He got up and went to his room, closed the door and refused to talk with us. We stayed outside his room apologizing all night. Let's just say both my friend and I felt like shit. It was our fault entirely and I hate thinking that we pressured him without fully explaining that it was weed. Worst of all a dab hit! What should we do now, he blocked us on all social media?

tifu,"The fuck up happened yesterday, but the situation was only rectified today. On Thursday, I became licensed as a cat/kitten foster parent through my local humane society. The process was really easy and all they had to do was come look at the space I intended to keep them in and okay, which they did.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday rolls around and I already get a placement. Two (super cute) 5 week old kittens need to be in foster care for socialization. I put them in the approved space, open the kennel, then leave to go get their food ready. When I come back (about 5 minutes later) they are no where to be find. I'm looking around when I hear a scrambling in the wall. That's when I notice that there is an opening in the drywall near the floor. After panicking for a few minutes I realize I can take a video on my phone and see where they are. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here's where the second fuck-up happens. In the video it looked like they were cut off from going farther by the 2x4s in the wall. I had somewhere to be so figured they'd make their way out to eat later. Cut to 3 hours later. I get home and there is only one cat in the room and I can hear crying from inside the wall. Took another video and the cat is not viable. Somehow, he had gotten behind the 2x4s and was stuck in the wall. 

&amp;#x200B;

After turning off the air conditioner so we could hear, we pinpointed the area and went to work. It was about 10 at night at this point and all hardware stores were closed so we had to drill a bunch of holes into the wall close together so we could eventually make a hole in the wall. We get through the first one at around 11:30 PM and the kitten has run up into the ceiling to get away from the sound. We pinpoint him again he's right next to the bathroom fan. We go to work taking the fan out and are able to see him, but not reach in a get him. After making a second hole with the drill it's about 1 AM, he has run back into the wall, and I haven't even got the one kitten we do have set up in another room that we triple checked had no hole. At this point, our house is about 90 degrees, we're so tired we can barely move, and the kitten is no longer crying or visible. Thinking it is the only option at this point, we put some formula into one of the holes in the hopes that he will at least stay hydrated and try to get some sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 5 AM we get up and go to work again. He still isn't visible, the milk hasn't been touched, and his cries are sounding weak. At this point I'm preparing to call both the fire department and the foster care emergency line because, again, this is my very first placement and I'm thinking this kitten is going to die in my wall. We decide to start playing YouTube videos of mama cats calling their kittens and it works! We're able to grab him out of one of the holes! He lost weight so now we have to bottle feed him every few hours until his weight is back up, there are two holes in our drywall, we got about 3 hours of sleep, and everything is covered in dust.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Got a kitten to foster who found an opening in our drywall and got into the wall. He was stuck for 12 hours, we got about 3 hours of sleep, there are two new holes in our drywall, the bathroom fan isn't functional anymore, and he lost weight so we now have to bottle feed him until it's back on.",TIFU by not knowing about a gap in my drywall.

So we're at a soft play for a kid who my daughter goes to school with. Lovely kid, nice play area, everyone is happy.

About an hour and a half into the activities, I'm through my second pint of Pepsi and nature is calling. I adjourn to the restroom, bleed the lizard and turn to wash my hands.

And there it is. Like a big, red, flashing light. A laminated and beautifully presented sign stating ""Do not use middle sink"".

Anyway, the take away from this is a) if you put a big red button in front of me, I will push it. And b) apparently the middle tap doesn't turn off and will flood the bathroom and the surrounding area at an alarming rate.

By this point, the party had moved into a side room for food so it's not like the birthday itself wasn't ruined. And I like to think I made a plumbers day in overtime. I also taught a big evil corporation/franchise a lesson in turning off the stop valve rather than printing out a sign. So really I'm the good guy here.

I love wearing it and it means a lot to me so I try to protect it and take it off if I'm doing any sort of work that could potentially damage it. Well today while cleaning a pot, I noticed the ring was rubbing against the pot so I decided to wrap it in a paper towel and put it in a bucket with my phone. When I was done cleaning, I went back to my room and and took everything out of the bucket one by one. When it was the paper towel's turn, I noticed it was too... soft. I unwrapped it, wrapped it back up again and unwrapped it again in with shock on my face and disbelief on my mind. Texted my boyfriend about it and went on the hunt for my ring. I've looked through the trash can 3 times, the kitchen floors, my own floor, and the bucket like 10 times already. Luckily boyfriend has been supportive. Though he does thinks I'm now the greatest magician of all time *eyeroll*. I don't think I ever want to wear a ring ever ever ever ever again :(

I am working on an app to find things to do in my city and I sometimes wear a t shirt with our logo and carry around a sign to try to get tourists to download the app. Today I was walking around and there were some people trying to sell CDs to people on the street. One guy calls out my company name and starts smooth talking me, saying hey take the free CD. I normally just ignore these guys but I wanted people to like my app, so I stupidly took the CD and then he started saying he'll download the app and a bunch of other guys came over saying that as well. They smooth talked me a while and then asked for a tip for downloading the app and giving me the CD. I was thinking, ok I got a few downloads, that's worth a few dollars, but really I wasn't thinking straight, so I gave one guy $10 and said to split it up among them. But then he took it and left and the other guys wanted money for their CDs. I said I couldn't give them all money. They took their CDs back and one guy left, but the other guy started yelling at me about how that the other guy isn't gonna split the money. I just stood there stupidly while he yelled at me and said I'm sorry and then he said ""get the fuck out of here"" so I left. Felt pretty down afterwards because if I can't even handle a situation like this, how am I going to handle building out my app, and I've never been bullied to give these guys money before, don't know what happened today.

I've been with D for 4 1/2 years- we were Highschool sweethearts, with a long and complicated history that reflected our devotion to each other.


About a month ago, D came out (Pre-Everything) to his close friends and family while I had known for only a little while more. The signs were there and I had actually helped guide him to his new name and everything but it's still a big step.


Anyways, I'm heteroflexible but outside of the occasional partner we would share- things were kosher. But all of a sudden, we begin to talk more and more about our dynamic and what we both want and without getting too detailed, the direction our relationship was going.


Now, I can say without a doubt (I was thorough) that I am not gay. Disagree if you want based on my history but I would like a heteronormative lifestyle for myself. 


My partner is who he wants to be and I support that 100% but for me to continue as his partner, would only undercut his transition. If I stayed it would be for the memories of who he was and that isn't what A (his dead name/old life) would have wanted. Instead we both mutually agreed to break up. 


It was the right decision and i cant help but feel like I fucked up. I want to blame myself for not being flexible enough to fit myself into his new life but that's just it- I can't change myself just as much as he can't change who he is. I loved A but D deserves that same kind of love from someone who is able to provide it for him.

tifu,"Last year, I happened to be in the same town as where my best friend lives while I was on a work trip. On an afternoon when I had time to kill, I decided to pay a surprise visit to him and his wife. They had also recently moved there, so I hadn't seen their house yet. 

When I arrived at his house, I saw a car in the driveway and it looked like they were home. So I got out of my rental car and strolled up to ring the doorbell. At this point, I was feeling kind of giddy, since I hadn't seen them in a while and it was fun to surprise them. However, after a few rings I started to think that there was nobody home. Maybe they both took one car somewhere. 

This is where my FU begins. For some reason, I checked to see if the door was locked. It wasn't. So when I turned the knob and it gave way, I cracked the door open to see if it looked like there was anyone home. At that moment, their dog (who is a spritely young lab) came to the door and tried to squeeze her way outside. So I pushed her back in and proceeded to enter the house. 

I am not a smart man. As many people have told me, it's probably not a good idea to waltz into an open house like that when you've never visited and you're not sure if anyone is home. Oh well. Once I was inside, I thought it would be funny to send my friend, call him Alex, a [picture](https://i.imgur.com/265pdIs.png) of his dog I his own house and tell him not to leave his door unlocked. 

As soon as I sent the picture, I heard the door from the back porch open and close. Oh no. I immediately started announcing that I'm in the house, saying my name and all that. But this didn't assuage the now alarmed wife of Alex, call her Nicole, as she came in from the back yard to hear a man inside her house. 

While Nicole knows me well, she understandably did not recognize my voice immediately. What is more, she couldn't see me because I was in another part of the house. For a few seconds after I announced that I was there, it was very quiet. I could tell she was deciding what to do and perhaps finding a good weapon to take me down with. She said something like, ""who's there?!"" in a defensive tone. It was at this point that I realized my FU. I continued to say it was me, but I don't think it really registered with her until she saw me come around the corner into her field of view. As we made eye contact, she breathed a sigh of relief put down the hammer she had raised over her head. 

It was at this moment that Alex got my message and called me, thinking that he actually left his door unlocked. I apologized profusely to Nicole and soon was on my way back to work. We all exchanged a laugh about it, and I thanked the heavens that Nicole didn't give me a concussion. Like I said, I am not a smart man.

Well this time I guess I overdid it on the soap because next thing I know I slipped and slid down into the bath tub and smashed both my chest and left elbow onto the granite/edge of the bathtub that connects to the granite. 

Immediate blinding pain in my left elbow. Can't move my arm.

I get out of the shower and try to compose myself but then I looked at my elbow and that all went out the window.

My elbow didn't look like an elbow. It was so deformed. I thought it was a dislocation so I called up my parents and told them we need to go the ER ASAP.

We get there, do an xray  and lo and behold... ya boi broke his fucking elbow.

I'm on my way to get corrective surgery now and I'll update y'all as soon as I can. If you wanna know what the fracture is like, look up ""olecranon fracture""

TL;DR: Slipped in the shower and broke my elbow. Needs surgery.

edit: out of surgery. it went well. arm is still sedated which is very weird but I should be okay within a month!",TIFU by slipping in the shower
tifu,"TIFU: so this was a while back but my family had recently moved into a new- build house, in just before Christmas. Over the summer I had been around to help the installation of a new ventilation system because it is one of these pseudo-air-tight/ low heat loss houses. Later that year I came home from a stressful semester at Uni for Christmas. It was nice to be home but was getting a little stir-crazy. On boxing day I realised I was about to lose my shit if I didn't get out but none of my friends were around. Idea.png: got a little left in a smol baggie in my room. Wait until everyone apart from my wee bro (16) was asleep (hes playing Pubg or something so distracted). Always a bit paranoid  by smelling of green so put  on an old shitty coat and go outside and think of place to smoke. No wind, frosty night, clear sky- lovely. Go down the side of the house- no windows, out of sight from street level- perfect! Make effort to try and smoke facing downwind so smoke blows off me. Strange breeze keeps changing. I walk back and forth a bit but the smoke seems to always follow me. Nvm. Sneak back in through back door silently take jacket off. Happily blazed af. Hear some movement upstairs. Probably just bro? He's not playing videogames but is looking at me very strangely "" what were you doing??"" ""nothing"" \* runs up stairs to take a shower\* nice and warm. Step out of shower blazed and confused to find all hell has broken loose. Sister (15) was crying and screaming with Dad, bro is confused. Get yelled at hysterically- no clue- goes to bed. Wakes up the next morning and bump into mum.  "" do you even realize what happened last night?!"" ""no?"". ""You were standing under the ventilation intake vent."" MFW i realize that the wind wasnt  wind but i had been walking from one side to the other of the vent along that side of the house. MFW i know where all the system goes. MFW I realize one of the biggest outlets is directly pumping into little sisters room.  


TLDR: I blew weed smoke through the ventilation system directly into my little sisters room and my family woulnt speak to me for weeks after.",TIFU by inadvertently hot-boxing my family home with family in it on boxing day.
tifu,"This happened a few hours ago and might not seem too bad compared to some of the stuff on here, but I’m still in physical pain. So I’m a host at a Mexican restaurant and part of my job is taking carryout orders over the phone. Someone (let’s call him Derek) calls and orders some tacos, guacamole, and shrimp ceviche, so I go straight to the computer and put it in. I immediately realize that Derek had ordered off of the dinner menu, but we don’t serve dinner until 5. The manager tells me it’s fine, and that the cooks can make everything except the shrimp ceviche. 

So I call Derek to let him know we can’t get him the shrimp ceviche, but it goes to voicemail. I think about leaving a message but decide it wasn’t that big of a deal and he probably wouldn’t check his voicemail between then and when he comes in for the food, anyways. They finish with the food right as he gets in, and I start to take it out but have to go back to get him chips for the guacamole. While I’m in the back, Derek and the manager are chatting, and I assume she told him about the shrimp ceviche.

Derek pays and starts to leave, but when he’s halfway to the door, he turns and comes back because he wants to check that we gave him everything. I should have realized then that if he was checking, the manager probably didn’t tell him about the shrimp ceviche. But I didn’t, so I wait until he asks “where’s the shrimp ceviche?” I tell him we only serve it for dinner and that I tried calling to tell him, but he gets pissed. “The only reason we ordered anything at all was because we wanted shrimp ceviche.” He doesn’t say much but I can tell he is deeply angered. The worst part is he left a huge tip before he realized we didn’t get him the shrimp ceviche, which I know he wouldn’t have done if he’d paid after. 

TL;DR: I let a guy order something we weren’t serving yet, and if he hadn’t checked, he would have left thinking he’d bought and received it.",TIFU by selling a customer a dish we didn’t have and letting him walk away thinking he’d bought it
tifu,"Holy shit I’m fucking cringing and dying of embarrassment right now. I’m currently hiding in my room awaiting my death.

Okay so I got up this morning, feeling amazing since school just got out and was feeling productive and happy so I went outside into the forest and decided to do some cleaning because my grandpa told me he’d pay me quite a bit of money to cut down some trees to make the view better. I grab my chainsaw and go up into the forest and start sawing all of the dead trees down. Now, my grandpa is very, uh, fancy and particular or whatever and he has a certain way of doing everything. I thought I was doing an amazing job and so after a while, I took a break. I was sitting on a rock, thinking about life, when all of a sudden, I have the urge to nut. I don’t fucking know why, but I did. So I whip out my phone real quick and beat my meat. What I didn’t realize was that while I was doing that, my grandpa had started walking out into the forest probably to tell me how to “do it right”. I was literally in the process of nutting when he yelled my name. I spun around, not realizing that my dick was out and just about screamed when I saw him. He fucking fell over from that and I pulled up my pants faster than fucking ever and I HAD TO HELP HIM UP after all of that WITH NUT IN MY PANTS. I got the fuck out of there before he could say anything and now I’m here, writing this, thinking about what kind of shit I’ve gotten myself into. It’s only a matter of time before my parents get home a hear about it. 



TL;DR I was cutting trees in my forest and decided to nut. My grandpa caught me and fell when he saw me. I helped him up and got tf out and I’m waiting for parents to get home. It’s only a matter of time.

EDIT: My parents came home and my grandpa told them what happened. My parents are both embarrassed and mad at me.

tifu,"I work part time at a convenience store, at the end of every day we take our pastries (doughnuts, danishes, etc), write them off as product loss and throw them in the trash. They are in no way expired or gone bad, they’re only “in code” for 12 hours. 

I help close, so late shifts just me and one more person until 11pm. One day I had finished writing everything off, a few doughnuts, brownies, and a danish, and decided to eat the danish, I had already written it off, it was out of code so there’s no way I could put it back on the shelf, it was destined for the trash can so I ate it. 

About a week later a lady from corporate comes to talk to me at the start of my shift, says she knows I’ve been doing something wrong but wants to hear me confess to it. Somebody has been stealing cigarettes so I figure she’s mistaken that for me, tell her I don’t know what she’s talking about. She proceeded to tell me about a hidden camera in the employee area that caught me sneaking a danish, got a 7 day suspension for it.

I live alone and three days ago I decided to visit my parents.  They moved somewhere else three months ago. 

When I got to their home I was really tired and slept early. I woke up at like 9 pm and I was really hungry.  They didnt cook anything tasty so I decided to go to the nearest seven e.  I got to the seven e and looked for food that is to my liking.  I also noticed a can of green peas. It made me remember something really good that I already lost.  This is the FU happens. My hand moved itself and took it.  I didnt notice that I took it. 

But Id remember the cashier,  she was like the most beautiful woman I saw.  Shes maybe is in her late thirties.  So I paid my items while not noticing I was holding the can of peas.  She alsondid not notice. 

After I got my things and went to walk out of the seven e the cashier screamed at me. Saying that I'm a thief.  I finally noticed.  So I apoloziged to her saying it was a misunderstanding and she forgave me. 

And then she brought me to her home and we fucked.  Best day of my life.

tifu,"So this is not today but like a decade ago . But that day it was TIFU . So basically I was in school in my teens 14/15 . We used to play Table Tennis and we used to call it TT . Why is this important ? You'll soon find out . So we had an off-class because one of our teachers was on leave . So a female substitute teacher came to the class . She didn't really want to teach us anything either so she told us to go play outside . 

Most of my friends jumped of joy and ran out . I was overjoyed . So I asked the female teacher "" Ma'am do you wanna come outside with us and play TT ? "" She looked at me with a surprised face . She looked at me as if I had the balls big enough to ask her such a question . I found it odd too . My friends laughed and ran out . The teacher also stood up and went . I thought it was very rude of her .

When I went outside my friends were still laughing at me . They explained that the teacher misunderstood 'TT' for 'Titty' because people who don't play Table Tennis don't know that's it's short form . Then I got embarassed . I wanted to clarify , but I didn't . I mean what was I supposed to say ? "" Uh Ma'am I was not talking about playing with your boobs ? "" I hope atleast now she know what TT actually means .

tifu,"Not today but just over a week ago I went to go see Greta Van Fleet live. I so was insanely pumped to go see them live as I really prefer their live sound to their pre recorded. Anyway, it was in Toronto at a venue called Echo Beach. I had never heard of the venue before but I have been to loads of concerts so I didn't care where it was. That was arguably my first mistake. For context, I don't really go out much and I avoid parties or cities or malls cause they're are too many people. I've never really liked being around a whole bunch of people let alone the one drawing attention. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself in the story.....

So that night I had to work (I nanny a 5 month old) until basically the last minute to head down to the concert so the whole day I was a little anxious about being late and also the baby was sick so the ""break"" time I get while she's supposed to be sleeping was almost non existent. But my boss let me out super early cause she knew about the concert so I get a lot more time. So I get home, shove food in my face, grab my boyfriend and we uber down nice and early. I wanted to get settled and maybe walk around a bit before finding our seats and just to make sure we weren't late cause of traffic or anything. On the way to the concert I finally look up the venue and see that it's not a seated venue. ""Its okay the music will be worth it."" I say to myself - having never been to a non seated venue. 

So we get to the venue and walk around a bit, my boyfriend grabs a mixed drink and I grab a cider and we head to the stage. We stand off the the left of the stage, leaning up against the VIP part of the venue incase we want to lean or sit during the concert. I can see the stage and there are a lot of people but I have plenty of space so I am good. 

Now. Before I begin the story of my colosal fuck up I need you to know that 1. I am agressively aware of how I fucked up. And 2. The reason I haven't told many people and the reason I'm afraid to talk about it now is because I am afriad people will hear, or read, the words I am saying and at the end all they will hear is ""girl at concert took too many drugs"" but please try and read and understand the context I had for the concert and the context I had for myself. 

THE FUCK UP

So prior to discovering it wasn't a seated venue my boyfriend and I planned on taking edibles at the concert. This is not something new to us by any stretch. We smoke almost every night and have been for years. Its a nice way to relax at night imo. The only way we don't is if we can't afford too which has happened many times, it's a luxury after all. But we also take edibles regularly without issue. However, to be fair, we usually smoke or do edibles in familiar safe environments with just the two of us or a couple other people. So in hindsight, when I found out about the venue I shouldn't have taken any because I tend to get nervous in crowds and for people who know how weed works, it's not just a make happy drug as portraied in movies or shows or anything like that it really just plays off of how you are feeling. So if your feeling happy weed is great and increases your happiness. But if your depressed weed will likely make you more depressed. It really all depends on the mood you go into in. So I tell my boyfriend I want to wait till the music starts to take the edibles. So we lean and we actually see people we know who we knew were coming to the concert but we weren't sure if we'd see. I go over cause my boyfriend doesn't want us to loose our spot. When I get back some strangers start talking to us but they actually seemed pretty cool and we discussed Toronto, Greta, other bands. Casual chatter. Then the opening band starts. It's important to note at this point that I ,being a very punctual person, assumed that the crowd at this point was going to be the crowd more or less for the whole concert. I thought people allowed other people space and I also did not realise the crowd Greta could pull in Canada as I had only known one other person to know them in Toronto and it seemed like noone was talking about them. I've heard them on the radio since the concert but I didn't before. So long story short I was very naive and ignorent of what I was getting myself into. So the opening band starts and we take the edibles. They are sour gummies at 10mg each and I took 3. Rare for me as we usually take 2 but we have done it before with no issue. So I take all three. The sun starts to go down and the musics good. And for people who usually take edibles 30mg really is not that much just so you know. The plan was not to get super fucked up by any stretch. 

 The opening band plays 6 songs. Nearing the end of the last song is when people start filing in. I had no idea where they were all coming from but I really had no problem at that point. Except as more people came in apparently it was decided that where we were standing was going to be the high way for the concert so people were going back and forth like no tomorrow. We were getting backed into our corner and I could no longer see the stage. But I wasn't even slightly freaked out. That was until I realised that I was about to hear Greta Van Fleet live. In person. In front me. I was finally going to hear them. I had been waiting for this moment for so long it was insane. I truely could not care that I couldn't see the stage because all I wanted to do was hear them. And then my heart started pounding really hard. And everytime I took my eyes off the direction of the stage, hoping for a glimpse, I just saw people passing by me and filling the beach infront of me. It was okay at first, at least thats what I told myself. My boyfriend and I had fun people watching as people passed. But there was a sound test before they came on and my heart leapt everytime the crowd got a little louder becuase I thought they were coming on.

 I then started to get a little bit light headed and the people started to get even closer to where I really had no room. I was pressed up against my boyfriend but people kept bumping us trying to get by. I then turn to my boyfriend and ask if we could move to a slightly less populated area. He looks back and says there really isn't one. And thats the first time I looked back since taking the gummies. And the crowd had gone from what I thought was a good sized crowd to a ligitimate sea of people with no horizon. I couldn't see a place that wasn't full of people. I tried to calm myself down by reminding myself that the music will be great and everyone is here for the music. I also tell myself that if I ruin this night for myself and my boyfriend I will never forgive myself. That I have been so excited for this moment that once I get into it I'll calm down. But then I straight panic. According to my boyfriend when I turned around the second time after asking if we could possibly move my face went white. All color gone. And I believe him because I was not okay. I start to push him forward and try to move out of the crowd but I had waited to long. There were people in every direction looming over me like a horror movie and I truely felt trapped because there was no possible way to leave the crowd except very slowly and I felt like I had unknowingly given up control to my body because I wanted to leave but I couldn't right away. I started swaying and I remember I bumped into one lady and when I couldn't really lift my head after that I knew something was wrong. I think she grabbed my shoulders but I am not sure. I kinda remember slumping down to the groud and being on my knees but again in not sure. I passed out. But of course I didn't know I passed out and I started having passed out dreams which are just so bizzare because I think I could still hear what was happening but I had no control over my body and then I came to and there were 4 men carrying each of my limbs RUSHING me out of the crowd and I have this disgusting feeling like I wet myself. My head is dangling forward and at some point someone asks me my name and I answer but then I fall out of it again as I watch people pass by me. I hear comments like ""Now that's hard core"" ""Someone partied too hard"" and apparently when it all started someone yelled to get the beer out of my hand because I was still clutching to it. My boyfriend said the men had to yank the cider out of my hands because my body just shut down. I don't remember that.

 But then suddently I open my eyes and I see sand. I look up and there are way less people around me. I'm still getting carried but I lift my head. And just like that I am fine. My body is my own. The men place me down on the sand and I sit there. Aggressively aware of what just happened and they ask if I can stand. I immediately go into full cooperation mode as I know what these men just saw and I now have to explain to them what happened and that I'm now okay. We go to the hospital tent and the people there start asking me questions. And I answer them all. I tell them everything as I know they are simply doing their jobs. They tell me that edibles go striaght to the blood stream and thus have a stronger quicker effect and maybe next time space them out or just don't take that many and I listen and agree. They were so kind and understanding and I was fully convinced I was going to the hospital but they said that since I was okay I could re join the concert. I had to sit there for about 10 minutes though just in case it happened again, which I get. I sat there listening to Greta in the background. Knowing I just ruined everything I had been so looking forward to. I see my boyfriend who looks so worried and I realise I ruined his night too. He'll never admit it and he claimed when I got to talk to him after the tent that all that mattered was that I was okay. And he cried because he thought something was seriously wrong with me and I hugged him for a long time as I also needed a hug. I know how scary that must have been for him so I hugged him tight. And I know the words he said are true. I know he loves me more than a concert and if the shoes were flipped there is no way I would hold this against him or anything like that but I can't help feeling like I fucked up his chance to see Greta live as well which really hurts. 

We stayed in the venue for a bit because I wanted to see them live so badly. I would listen for a bit but start to freak out again so we kept backing up futher and further away. I got an ice cream cone because food calms me down which helped a bit but then I had to call it because people kept looking at me and I'm pretty sure I saw someone take a picture of me which leads me to believe there are plenty of photos and videos of me going through the crowd which is horrifying because I for sure looked like I over dosed. I kept worrying that the people I knew that were there saw what happened and I finally got a good look at the crowd and it was massive. I could barely see where we were before this all happened which made me realize just how far I was carried and how little I was concious of it because I had such short memories. I could feel my own urine on me and just shame. Complete shame. Because I know I did this to myself. I know it's my fault. So we left the venue early but actually stayed till the last song, before the encore, just sitting outside the venue on the rocks by the lake just listening from afar. There was noone around us and I still heard them live. That was the best part of my night tbh and my boyfriend and I really bonded then. And he claims that the sound engineer really ruined the concert for him because Josh's (lead singer) mic was turned up to high and his voice was peaking and over charging the rest of the band which you could barely hear but I think that was a mix of him just trying to make me feel better and us being so far away from where you are actually supposed to listen to the music. But we left after the last song because I just couldn't handle being there anymore. 

It has honestly been a lot to handle. I feel like a different person. I am really struggling with the simple knowledge that that happened to me but also the pure shame and guilt that goes along with it. The memories of the comments people made make me feel so dirty because I know how it looked to them and there is nothing I can do about that. Not to mention how uterly guilt and ashamed I feel that on top of all of that I took an uber home and didn't even realize till the next day that I didn't put anything down on the seat and I just sat in that nice mans car after wetting myself. And honestly I can't see myself ever forgiving myself for that one. That's some scumbag, asshole shit that I just didn't realize I did. I didn't listen to the band for a good 5 days and when I did I cried because I realised the opportunity I fucked up for myself. Odds are the next time they come to Toronto they'll have blown up and become super popular and I really wanted to see them early on just to have that memory for the rest of my life. I still have bruises on my arms from the men carrying me. They're very faded now but they were quite large for the first couple days after. And again those men were doing their job not one single ounce of me is confused about that. I would have done the exact same thing and my boyfriend and I are extremely greatful for how fast everything happened. Those men were aware and ready and I am so happy about that and it makes me feel so safe even though I didn't feel it at the time if that makes sense. The bruises were a strong reminder of what happened though and I am ashamed I have them. But now I feel like I am constantly on the verge of another panic attack for the smallest things. I have an anxiety disorder and I've had panic attacks before but nothing even close to this and now I feel like I will have one for small things that would usually simply make me a little nervous. Its like my nerves haven't calmed down still and it's been over a week. And everytime I feel like I have to pee I am reminded of how it felt to come to and having peed yourself and it makes me so nervous and so full of shame. Only my boyfriend and my sister know what happened in detail and it is because I am afraid everyone will dismiss it as ""took too much weed"" and will dismiss me and move on and won't take me seriously when I say I'm really struggling with what happened. Of course I'm not an idiot and I know that it was hightened by the weed but that doesn't change the fact that it was extremely real to me and I don't know how to get back to normal life now and I feel very out of place as the world continues to move forward. I don't really know why I'm writing this out and posting this here but my best guess is to finally let it all out because I haven't even told my boyfriend how much I've been struggling and it's really nice to put everything down in the rawest form but know it won't get back to me and effect my real life because noone will know it's truely me. My boyfriend is on this subreddit though so hello if you see this and I know you love and support me and I do believe you but I'm sorry I'm still strugging with it and I don't really know what to do about it because the shame of it all is eating me alive.

TLDR: I had a panic attack and was dragged out of the crowd before the band even came on stage.

I'm also posting this to other subs so sorry if you see it again.",TIFU by ruining my chance to see Greta Van Fleet (my favorite band) live.
tifu,"This tale is dark and full of fuck ups, as well as a come up. Get ready for a roller coaster if you decide to read it all the way through.  Obligatory disclaimers:  didn’t happen today, on mobile. TLDR at the bottom.

So last year I was flying from SFO to PSP (San Francisco, Ca to Palm Springs, Ca).  I was on a vacation going to see my Mom.  I had an 11AM flight I had to be up by 7/7:30 to finish getting ready and take my hour Bart ride to the airport.  The decision to go out drinking with friends the night before was a poor one, but not the true fuck up; though it did lead the way to it.  

So, I went to my favorite local bar, played some pool, had some shots and some beers, and eventually took a lyft home because I’m a responsible drinker.  

Flash forward to 8am the next morning.  I wake up, probably still a wee bit drunk, and do a cursory search for my phone within my immediate area to check the time and can’t find it.  I open my iPAD see that it’s 8am.  Not ideal, but not terrible, I’m packed and stuff, just need to do a quick shower and I can bounce.  At this point I assume my phone is in my purse and that I just forgot to set my alarm.  Oh how naive I was back then.  I take a shower and get airplane ready, then look in my purse to get my phone so I can text my Mom and check Bart times.  

To my great dismay there was no phone.  I dug around my sheets, pulled my bed away from the wall, tore apart my room searching for it.  Luckily my bestie/roomie was home and getting ready for work so I asked her to call my phone, hoping it wasn’t dead.  As she called I ran upstairs to listen.  

Nothing.  I call down to ask if she was calling or not and I just get silence for a moment, then she says, “You just answered when I called right now.”  

Now I’m shitting my pants, I still have no phone so most definitely did not answer. She called back again and a man answered.  I’d left my damn phone in my very responsible Lyft back from the bar.  The true fuck up of story, that led to more mayhem.  

I take the phone from my bestie and talk to my driver from last night.  Of course he does not live in the area and can’t get back here until the afternoon.  That doesn’t really work for me as my flight is in a meer 2 ½ hours from that moment.  I am one lucky bitch though, because the driver actually lives very close to SFO and is willing to get out of bed after a long shift getting drunk asshats like myself home safely from bars.  We decide to meet at Colma Bart Station to do the hand off of the phone.  This all lines up pretty well with my approaching flight so I check Bart times from my roomies phone and we set a time to meet since I have no way of calling him when I get there.   

I get to Colma station and he is in an orange jacket waiting for me with my precious phone, right at the gate so that I don’t even have to leave the station.  As soon as he saw me his eyes lit up and he said, “Oh no, it’s you!!!  You were so nice last night, I’m glad I woke up in time to help you out!”  I was floored, I don’t remember the ride, but damn if I’m not grateful for my generally gregarious nature.  I give him a $20, hug him over the turnstile and am off (I also gave him the max tip I could in the app as well as leaving a 5 star and glowing review).  What a peach! Seriously what a genuinely nice person.

I continue on to SFO and arrive about 1 hour before my flights departure time. I always travel to see my Mom with my large suitcase that I have to check so that I can shop while I’m down there.  1 hour is cutting it a bit close for me as I hate stressing out at the airport and would rather have had an extra half hour or so to get all the things done.  So I’m at the kiosk trying to print my bag tag because my dumbass hadn’t purchased a check bag when I booked. This is fuck up number 2.  I tried to pay with my card, but it wouldn’t go through.  I eventually have to go to the assistance booth and get help from a real live person.  About 15 min later he has a bag tag printed for me (which I purchased through the app on my phone while waiting in line for assistance with the hope of expediting my situation). When he put the tag on my bag I took a look at it and it seemed odd.  The airport code was for LAX.  I checked in with the clerk and asked that he double check that I’d gotten the right tag, about 5 min later (I’ve now got 40 min before departure time) after clicking and clacking away on his keyboard he insists that it’s right. I ask one last time to double check and eventually just kind of figured, he’s the expert I’m stressed out and just want to be on my way so I gathered what was left of my dignity and I made my way to my flight.  You will see how this was fuck up number 3 as we continue with my tale.

After some drama with the security I made it to my plane with meer moments to spare before they’d shut the doors.  I was ecstatic, I’d gotten all the things done and somehow made my damn flight.  

Now fast forward to Palm Springs Airport baggage carousel.  Guess what?  My bag was nowhere to be found.  My brain goes back to that damn tag and I start to get worried.  I go to the checked luggage assistance desk and let the attendant know that I’m missing my bag. I give him my plane ticket and a description of the bag, as many details as possible including some items inside of it. He does some quick research and lets me know that my bag is still at SFO, it didn’t make that flight and will be coming down on the next one.  Phew! This is cool, my Mom lives super close to the airport, I’ll just go back after the next flight arrives and grab it.  NBD.  The flight gets in at 5 and the attendant said that I’d hear from them by about 5:45 or so when my bag is found.  

I go meet my Mom, we grab some late lunch and go about our day.  Fast forward to 6pm.  I haven’t heard from the airport so I give them a call.  I am reassured that if it didn’t arrive on this flight it will come on the last one of the day that’s due to arrive around 10.  I’m less easy going about it this time and ask them to just double check that my bag will be coming and ask what I should do if it hasn’t.  That bag has all my toiletries etc, so I kinda need the stuff in it.  I’m told that the airline will reimburse any purchases within reason while I am bagless, so I once again chill out and go about my day.  

At 11pm there was still no call from the airline.  I call and there isn’t anyone left at the airport who can help me.  I let it go and just go to bed, nothing else I could have done at that point.  The next morning I wake up and speak with the guy helping me the day before.  He suggests I call central baggage and see if they can get to the bottom of this.  At this point the first flight from SFO has arrived and by bag was still not there.  

After getting the runaround and several false positives from the airline about the whereabouts of my bag I end day two of my vacation still bagless.  Now I’ve got a LPT mixed in here.  If the airline ever loses your bag, say that you’ve got some kind of fancy event to attend or a work conference.  The airline will buy you a clothes, bras, swimsuits, shoes, even makeup within reason.  Keep in mind you do have to have the cash to purchase everything up front and that you must keep all the receipts to show once your bag is found.

The next morning, day 3.  I call central baggage and get the runaround for about 2 hours.  The whole time I’ve been insisting that the original guy who checked my bag at the airport fucked up and sent my bag elsewhere, namely LAX, the code I saw on the tag.  No one would take the codes for the receipt I had for my bag and at this point I’m finally seeing red and do the good old, I won’t speak with anyone but a manager routine.  I finally get someone who will listen to me and take the codes I have on the receipt.  The gal puts me on hold for about 20 minutes while she uses the info I have to track down my bag.  When she comes back on the phone she says that she’s got good news and bad news.  My bag is currently en route to, wait for it, Moscow, Russia.  

Turns out there was a bag at PSP the whole time that had my tag on it, but didn’t match the description.  No one put two and two together until they took the numbers from my tag receipt.  

Moscow fucking Russia.  This is now day 4 and the airline had found my bag when it got to Moscow and sent it back via LAX.  By this time, my flight home was the next day.  I had bought quite a few things, because fuck the Man, and fuck that airline.  My mom and I were getting ready to go buy me some new luggage because at this point I didn’t really believe I’d ever see my bag again.  

As we were getting into the car I got the call, the airline had successfully received my bag and sure enough it was actually there and waiting for me to pick it up.  Holy cow, that saga was finally over.  I was reimbursed over $500 for all the shit I’d bought for my “work conference” as well as receiving a $750 credit for the inconvenience.  Being nice but firm with this kind of shit can really pay off.  Now my bag has travelled farther from home than I have and is really no worse for the wear, but I was able to buy a decent amount of new clothes and makeup!  Score! My fuck up wasn’t all bad after all.  

Moral of the story, don’t know if there is one, but wanted to share it with Reddit, it gives me a chuckle every time I think of it!

TLDR:  Got drunk and left my phone in my Lyft home.  This caused me to be late to my flight the next day, which caused me to rush through check in.  That led to the wrong tag getting put on my bag, which resulted in my bag being sent to Moscow, Russia instead of Palm Springs, Ca.  This led me to getting a bunch of free shit and credit from that airline.  A true fuck up to come up kind of tale.",TIFU by leaving my phone in a Lyft
tifu,"First off I’m a male : A little bit of background, I work as a delivery driver to make a little cash on the side. That said the company I work for has regulars order from us all the time, there is one couple in particular that I always sparked good conversation with. They are in their 70s and definitely look their age, that said they are pretty caught up in current day trends “hip” even. So it’s always nice to chat and pass time before I have to go back to the restaurant. Now this happened tonight and I doubt I’m ever going back there due to the corresponding events. Today I worked with who we will call “Bill” now Bill decides he wanted to close so I could leave early, unfortunately we got two deliveries put in last second and one happened to be the couple. Going into the call to take the order with the couple I was expecting the regular back and forth that I give all customers which is “hey how are you doing today man?” But the husband who we will call “jack” decides to tell me that I should join them to party at their place sometime because I’m just so amazing and chill. I took this as a joke of course. So I tell Jack that I was actually about to head out on their delivery and then go home so it would be fun (I said this jokingly or so I thought). So I get to their house and go to knock on the door but when I do I’m greeted with the wife who we will call “Jill “. Now Jill answers the door and is fully frontally nude, again these people are 70 at least. I promptly act like I don’t see some saggy ass tits in front of me and look at the ceiling. Then before I think this shit couldn’t get any worse I look back down to ask her for a signature and I see jack with his dick out. A 70 year old man looking at his 70 year old wife’s ass and then me with his lil wee wee swinging around. I asked them to please sign the receipt and then I took the food out. Now at this point I’m sure I was bright red and was trying to play it cool which btw is EXTREMELY hard in this situation. So jack comes up to me with his penis literally right by me and asks if I wanted to fuck his wife. I lost my cool and started stuttering like a bug saying all the reasons I couldn’t like having a girl already etc. At that point I guess he could tell I definitely did not want to fuck his wife so he grabbed the food rather hastily and sent me on my way. So I walked back to my car confused as to what the fuck my life is doing to me and drove home. Now I’m sat here worrying about any call backs I might get in the following days about bad service if these people are petty like that.

tifu,"Ok so small back story  last year I got my girl pregnant 2 months before I left for basic training. 

During basic she broke things off 2 weeks before I graduated because she said I was cheating on her in some impossible way. 

This girl is the love of my life even after everything that's happened I still want to spend everyday of my life with. Our kid is currently 2 months and I have been trying to get back with her. Even though shes hesitant but we act like we are together we fuck and hangout and still do everything like we are. But her mom who has this power to make this woman do what she wants by the power guilt is convincing her not to ""date"" me. 

Her mom is also the reason that she was convinced I was having sex with other girls while in basic training. 

Well today I left for AT and yesterday i spent about an awesome 8 hours with her and my daughter and we called it a night. A friend of mine asked me if I could stop by so I did. She knows about my situation and she tried to talk to me about it knowing how badly I wanna get with my ex and how much I still love. Her boyfriend left for a few hours to go the bar and we were just sitting around having a deep conversation. She walked over and gave me a hug and then just boom we were fucking on the kitchen counter. And then in the back yard and then went to the park and fucked some more. 

Hers the fuck up. She knows my ex and her friends which she told about this knows my ex. My ex hates this girl with a passion and now on top of the fear of basically ruining the small chance I had to return to the happiest time of my life with the love of my life. I might have gotten another girl pregnant who is also dating my bestfriend.

tifu,"Yep, I did, using a throwaway, sorry for formatting blabla

So today there was an event here in my city. Everyone went there, but it was more for the elder and so on. So naturally I was bored. I went there with my dad, step-mom, brother and step-sister. 

Here, in my country, the weather is kinda shit, so after like 2 hours I said, that I’m going home, that it’s too cold and I really went home, but on the way home (I had a little bit of alcohol in myself) I felt like having a smoke. Unfortunately I didn’t take any with me, so I said to myself, that my dad must have a pack hidden somewhere. I took the challenge of finding it and I regret it.

When I came home, I decided to go through all sorts of stuff, but I noticed that the bag, where he must’ve kept the pack, was empty, so in my utter despair, I thought that maybe he could have an extra pack in a table in his bedroom. I made sure that I’m not going to my step-moms drawer and as so I was very surprised when I opened it, the first thing I see is a vibrator. I was like “ok, wow, don’t need to see that” and so I closed it. But there’s a second one, and my lust for a smoke was too strong, so I opened it without thinking. 
That was the mistake. What I layed my eyes upon was a big collection of all sorts of sex toys. Like a really big collection, I was stunned and, I hate to admit it, horny.

I think you can all imagine what happened next. 

I’m truly ashamed of myself, and I hope that they will never find out.

For context, we have been in a really tight financial position for a while and haven't been able to buy anything that wasn't strictly necessary. Well, we're finally doing a little better, amd we were grocery shopping, and I decided to treat myself just a little and grab a Coke Zero out of the coolers by the registers. All well and good, we load everything into the trunk, minus the Coke which stays with me.

My wife usually drives when we go somewhere, so I sip my tasty treat all the way home. We pull into a parking spot at our apartments, and we chat for a minute before getting out, amd that's when I got clumsy.

While still sitting in the car, I fumbled my drink and it spilled directly between my legs, partially onto the seat, but mostly the middle of my jeans. I then had to walk shamefully from the parking spot to our apartment door(thankfully we didn't see anyome on the way in).

tifu,"So this fuck up actually happened today. My girlfriend works til midnight occasionally and yesterday was one of those days. I hung out with a buddy last night and we drank and smoked cigars. 

Fast forward to midnight and my girlfriend comes home. We crawl in bed shortly after and I, being a little buzzed, start getting kind of touchy. One things leads to another and my girlfriend is on top of me with her shirt off and we begin making out.

We keep this going and I start kissing other parts of her body as well. But every time we lock lips my nose feels a little moist. I just think that’s it’s from the moisture and sweat of our bodies against each other and brush it off.

All the lights are off and as we are about to do the deed a phone text goes off that lights up our room. She looks at my face with a shocked expression and tells me she thinks I’m hurt. I grab my phone and turn on the flashlight. I see that her face and body are covered in blood.

I quickly realize what must have happened and put my finger up to my nose and look at it to see it covered in blood. I start to laugh and tell her that I have a bloody nose and that her face and body are covered in it too. She is a little grossed out at first but she starts laughing as well. We jump in the shower to clean up the blood that had spread to every part of her I had kissed. I had mistook a bloody nose for sweat and with every kiss, I was rubbing it on her.

We get back in bed and don’t attempt anything else that night. I fell asleep chuckling in my head about how I had spread my blood on my girlfriend while we we were trying to get busy.

tifu,"Some backstory: This happened a few months ago.  I'm a younger guy (19) and I work in a warehouse. I've worked there for a little over a year now. My co-worker is 40+ (I've never asked because, ya know, manners). She works long hours to support her disabled husband. She also lost her daughter a couple years ago. 

We talk whenever we're both on a break, and it's often about how screwed up our lives are. My mother died a while back and I have to support my younger brother by myself. She has to work insanely hard just to pay rent. 

Here's where I fucked up. 

She, for the first time ever, wanted to show me a picture of her daughter. She pulled out a phone that was so badly cracked, it's amazing she could even see what was on the screen. I couldn't make anything out of the picture because it was so badly broken. She said she was getting a new phone soon, but didn't know if she could transfer the photos from her broken phone to the new one. 

I offered a solution. I had a spare SD card that I never found a use for and I was willing to give it to her. That way, she'd be able to copy and paste the photos onto the SD card and put them on the new phone. She didn't know how to do that, so I said I'd do it. 

A few days pass and she gets her new phone. It's a $30 dollar Trac phone but it works well enough. We go on break and I put the SD card in her broken phone. She points out the pictures she wanted moved over to the new phone. I select them and hit copy to SD card. 

Only I didn't. I hit delete. The phone was so badly cracked I couldn't even tell what option I'd selected. I thought I hit Copy but I fucked up instead. I had one job. The realization hit me like a truck and I felt sick. 

I couldn't even look at her while she cried after I told her what happened. I just sat there with disgust in myself. It went on for what seemed like an hour. 

When she was done crying she saw that I'd began to tear up too. She said it wasn't my fault. That she probably would have done it too. I felt so awful. 

She said she had plenty of pictures of her at home. She had all of the baby pictures, her first day of kindergarten pictures, and most of her birthday pictures. The only ones she didn't have were her graduation pictures and others she took with her phone. 

I suggested we go through her Facebook account
(Which was a risky thing to say because I didn't know if she had one). She showed it to me and I was able to download some other ones she couldn't get on her own.

The ones she has now will never replace the ones I erased, but it's something. That was the worst thing I'd ever done in my entire I life and I will never again be responsible for anything on another person's phone.

I was walking my dog today when I passed by a family (a mom, dad, and young daughter who looked about 8) sitting on their front porch playing with some bubbles. The dad saw me and said “Hey look at that puppy!” The daughter got pretty stoked so I said “Hey do you wanna pet him? He’s super nice.”
The daughter comes over and I’m thinking she’ll just pet him real quick and then I’ll keep walking. After she pets him the daughter says “Come over here, we’re playing with bubbles and my mom can do some cool tricks!!” So I walk over and my dog sniffs the dad who pets him a bit. As the moms getting ready to do her bubble trick, I’m paying close attention trying to act interested for the young daughter. 

As the mom blows her first bubble, my amazing, wonderful, friendly dog starts peeing. On the mom. Who’s wearing flip flops. 

I didn’t notice until he finished peeing and I honestly didn’t know what to do. I basically just said “Oh god, I’m so sorry, I wasn’t looking, sorry sorry sorry” and just kinda walked away. They didn’t freak out about it, but she obviously wasn’t stoked about the whole urine thing.

We start talking about Alanis Morissette and he starts talking about “the song with the teddy bear” and I’m looking at him like he’s got a few heads. 

I somehow figure out that he’s talking about “You Oughta Know” and I mention “the cross I bear” and he said, yeah! Same thing! Cue head scratching. 

“Same thing?” I ask.

tifu,"So this happened a week ago, but I can't stop thinking about it.

So, through one of my friends, I learned you could slow your heart rate just by focusing really hard. 

So I thought I'd look into it a bit, why not? And I looked up these tutorials, and meditation and that stuff, apparently it takes ages to learn, and years to master, so I almost lost interest. But I gave it a go anyway.

I really got into it as well, full on focus, nothing else matters kinda thing. And I found out, that it came extremely naturally to me, it was easy! The results were very noticeable, I could feel the change!

So I pushed myself, I wanted to see how far I could go, so I put my mind to it, and really tried, and I mean really tried. I could feel my heart slowing to a crawl, and the adrenaline, it was insane!

But at the same time it was relaxing, I couldn't help but wish to be no where else, this felt too good, but it didn't stop there, my heart rate was still dropping, but I was no longer controlling it, but I wasn't worried, I was so peaceful.

Then it hit me, the fact that if I don't do  something, this is going to kill me, part of me didn't care, part of me didn't want to care, but I knew I had to, and it took everything I could, but I started to snap out if it.

I slowly but surely got my heart rate back to normal, but I already missed the peaceful bliss. This sacred me, I knew that I couldn't stop myself from wanting to go back.

Since then, I've done it twice more, each time it got harder to bring myself back. 

I'm pretty sure this is going to kill me, I'm not suicidal, life ain't great and all but, I've never experienced anything like this.

Not a bad way to go out though.

It was daytime, I was going home from a meeting in a bar, smoking a cigarette and decided to buy some coffee in a street coffeeshop. I ordered a cup of coffee, while finishing my cigarette, and when I finished it, I decided (stupidly) to throw it in the plastic trash bin, full of paper cups and paper napkins, all that in a plastic bag inside that bin.

After few seconds I noticed a little smoke coming out of it, I immediately freaked out and shoved my hand inside that trash bin, because the goby fell pretty deep inside the trash bin. I forgot to mention, that was happening in the city central street, full of people.

Fortunately, the smoke was from the plastic bag being melt by the still smoldering goby, so I made sure it was not smoldering anymore and threw it in the same bin. Then I excused myself in front of the confused guy making the coffee, with the words ""Sorry, I accidentally threw the goby inside and didn't want to start a fire..."". Then he smiled and gave me a wet napkin to clean my hands, and then I payed for the coffee, the end.

tifu,"Full disclosure: this was two days ago.

So a friend of mine has been depressed and been feeling particularly down last week after the guy she was dating left her because she was raped. She's a strong feminist and part-time model. As a result, unsavory guys are often contacting her, asking her to engage in relations with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, her condition was reaching so bad that she was hospitalized. I wanted to check in on her and make sure that she's okay. So every once in a while, I'd have to tell some guy harassing her to back off. On Tuesday, one guy was spamming in different facebook groups trying to get guys to message/harass her. I contacted the admins in those groups, fought him in comments and he was banned. On Wednesday, someone else attacked her in a group that was an admin in. I wanted to probe into his mentality and asked him what happened / his reasoning. After I saw that he'd only reply with ""trolling"" answers &amp; was continuing to dm her, I replied with ""bored now, bye"" and ignored all of his messages. He then spammed a bunch of nonsense and tried to find my former employer's address, and sent me that as a message. I asked him how he found that address, he replied with ""stop cyber bullying me,"" ""you're threatening me,"" ""please don't threaten and hurt me"" before replying with his intended jocular response ""I can write whatever I want, it's free speech."" I ignored that and asked again, how did he find that address and what does he plan to do. Each time he responded, he included those three lines ""stop bullying me..."" before replying with his actual remark. I took a screenshot, sent it to admins of other facebook groups that he was in, and they banned him while I blocked his messages. Later that night, I noticed that his account was deleted and I received an email saying that ""my facebook has been hacked."" Thursday afternoon, when I tried to log into facebook, I saw that my account was disabled. I submitted an appeal via the help center and then tried to ""verify my account"" through a different link (the first one allowed me to write a message while the second just asked for picture to prove my identity).

My guess is that the latest guy said those things in order to trigger facebook algorithms so that my account would be disabled. Alternatively, when I told the guys spamming her to hookup to back off, they likely reported my account for harassing them. Then, with multiple reports, facebook algorithm immediately bans you. To be honest I don't think facebook will do anything. I will probably have to just accept that my instagram, tinder, venmo, and everything else tied to my facebook is gone alongside the years of posts, messages, and contacts on my facebook. There's a small part of me that hopes someone reading this works for facebook and would reactivate my account but hoping is just setting yourself up for disappointment.

Tldr; Suicidal friend was being harassed, tried to help her &amp; keep her alive. Guy trolling her said ""stop cyber bullying me"" because I told him to stop messaging her. Both accounts banned. Moral of the story: Sometimes life is terrible and if you try to help people, karma will stab you in the face for fun.

Edit: I'm not saying I made a difference in her life. When someone's in that state of mind, it's really difficult to change them. The best thing I could have done was to guide her towards trained psychologists. Everything else (the stuff mentioned in this post) would have been marginal. Having said that, I would have still done it knowing the outcome. I'm just upset that facebook decided to permanently ban all of my accounts for this.

I scroll through all the people in the gc, only seeing a few numbers i know. I ask who the other phone numbers are, figuring they’re friends that i just haven’t been given their phone number yet. I ask around, and i don’t get anything except a reply from a cheeky boy we can call Chuck. Chuck screws around with me for a bit, still not telling me his name, sending emojis and all that. Another person starts talking, who will be known as Dolphin (don’t ask, nicknames n such) . Dolphin starts defending Chuck, telling me to shut up and to stop trying, so i jokingly tell her back to shut up. This is where the fuck-up happens. Dolphin asks me if i want to see a magic trick. Me, being my witty and quirky white boy self, i respond with, “Silly Dolphin you can’t make your dad disappear again.” Unto which i get banned from said gc. I’m not entirely sure if Dolphin was going to kick me before i made that comment, (“wanna see a magic trick?”) or after in spite. I then told her that kicking me from the gc was completely expected, still oblivious to the fact that Dolphin had no father. I finally got that idea through my 22 cm steel-plated skull that it just might be the case. I later confirmed with two people, one being her closest friend. Closest friend, let’s call her Jo. I tell Jo what happened, says that Dolphin isn’t responding. Later on i ask again, and Jo replies that Dolphin said that she’s fine. I beg to differ, judging from the severe lack of messages from Dolphin on my part. I don’t know entirely what to do at this point, i’ve texted her on multiple platforms, asked Jo to tell her i’m sorry, but nothing’s working.

tifu,"This  was about two days ago. I was studying for an exam and had picked up a  Monster energy drink from the shop. Usually i drink red bull but it was sold out, so i grabbed the next most identifiable thing. I drink it at around 6 pm and feel no different, not to  mention the taste was awful, so i carry on studying.

After  studying for a while i decide to take a break and start up my xbox. My  xbox time shows 4 AM (it's stuck in English time while i am in Bulgaria,  which is two hours ahead) but i knew i didn't sleep, but i wasn't  feeling tired either, so i just carried on. At around 7 AM i got a huge  burst of energy, so i went jogging and came back just in time for the  exam.

There was a long line and I was  starting to get jittery, annoying the people around me. As we were  getting closer to the front of the line, the prof heard the commotion  and came to ask what was going on. She saw how jittery i was and asked  if i was OK, i replied yes and went in to do my exam, which i absolutly  bombed.

Once that was done i went with  some friends to have some sushi, as i'd been bugging them to go for a  few months now, and they wanted to celebrate. Once we sat down at the  resturant, i crashed hard. i fell asleep multiple times at the table,  getting caught once. After the bill was settled, we all went our  seperate ways, and once i got home (4 PM) i crashed and fell into a deep  sleep on my bed.

I work 730-330, so I'm on that no problem I figure maybe I could make a quick buck, that's all cool. Wednesday, I drop by to get the rundown, meet the cats. She tells me I can watch TV, use the computer, whatever I like. Theres the bed I'll stay in, all that.      
Friday night, I'm planning on heading to my folks to stay the weekend. My job involves a lot of traveling to Northern Virginia, and my folks live in Maryland right now.

A few days ago, a friend and I had a conversation about programming, and he told me Python is a great language to start with. If I have a computer, starting to learn is easy peasy. 

I pack a day bag Thursday night and head over, making sure to bring a phone charger and I bring my guitar and an amp so i can practice while I'm there. Everything is great, I watch jeopardy, feed the cats, and prepare for work the next day, with a lunch and all. 

My boss texts me with the address for the job. Its up in Reston and I'm trying to figure out tomorrow and my weekend. I know I'm gonna be driving a lot, and Reston is closer to DC/MD than to my house. Finally, I call my mom and she says to meet up with her after work the next day. Shes coming down my way anyway, so I'll be able to feed the cats and all, but this makes it so i dont have to drive down and drive back up north. I also call my aunt who lives up toward the beltway and ask to spend the night.

So, before I call it a night, I make sure to pack most of my stuff that I'll need for the next day, including my phone charger. I left a couple things that I didnt wanna leave in my car while at work, like the guitar, but I packed up everything else to stay the night at my aunt's.  


Okay, so that's Thursday, the mishmash of events leading to the fuck up started Friday.

Friday morning, leave my aunts and make sure I have everything. Work, head to moms, unload everything from my car and wait for her to get home. Leave my car there, head down to VA for errands and the like, she drops me off at cat house. 

Alright we good. I'm there, taking care of cats, in time for jeopardy, waiting for them to get home. 8 rolls around, my phone is at 3% from navigating all day. I look for my charger. It dawns on me that my one charger I have is in my day bag in Maryland. They dont have any lying around. I go to plug in my guitar but realize I left a cable so that's a no go.. They wont be home til 10ish. Boredom sets in..

But they have the computer! Perfect, I'll just hop online. (Note I dont own a Windows PC so not having to surf on my phone or my cheap Chromebook is still kinda a big occasion for me.) This is where the tifu starts.

One friend of mine gave me a heads up about price movements on bitcoin so I load up Coinbase pro but forgot my password, bummer. Alright well maybe I could take a look at some python websites so I Google ""python"". This is cool, I logged into my email and bookmarked some of those links for later. Still bored though, so I load up cool math games cause RIP and play Bloons Tower Defense til they get home. 


Her husband drops me off in town and we wait a couple minutes for mom to meet us. She calls him and asks about some stuff. ""I mean hes still here, you can talk to him.""       
She asks some questions about python and coinbase and bitcoin and I explain that the sites I visited were secure and she doesnt have to worry about viruses or anything. She explains that her and her husband had been the victim of identity theft once upon a time so she doesn't really like that stuff on her computer, even though closed all the windows and tabs before I left. She thought I was trying to steal her information from her computer. 



Tl;dr: I cat sat for a family. Using their computer, I checked crypto prices and did some research on beginner programming lingo. They thought I was trying to hack into their computer.",TIFU by making the person I was housesitting for think that I was a hacker trying to steal their identity.

I was hanging out at a friend's place across town. My mom let me use the minivan because she knew I would be coming home late. We were binge watching Star Trek when I looked at my watch and realized holy crap it's 1:30am! I bid my friend farewell and headed out.

&amp;#x200B;

At the time my family owns a burgundy 1989 Plymouth Voyager. I forgot where I parked in the apartment building's lot, but I spotted the burgundy monstrosity and headed over. Using my key, I unlocked the door, started the van, and went to throw out some garbage out in a little garbage can we had.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't there. I looked around. The contents of this van were not ours. This was not our van. WTF. I got out, went to look for my van, and as I was wandering around security decided to detain me. It took 3 hours to convince them of the truth.

tifu,"This didn't happen today but I thought that I would share it anyway. After a long day me and my friends had been playing some minecraft afterwards we were all in a  group call so we could talk while playing, after a while of playing I told everyone I would be back in a bit. well I proceeded to have a session of self loving.  When I came back about 10 minutes later I realised my mistake  I had left my mic on and was still in the call. everyone could hear my little solo event. to make it even worse I had been saying the name of a girl I liked during the act and she is a mutual friend of some other members of the group that were playing and all I could hear was them all laughing about my endeavour they still haven't lived it down and they still call me the exhibitionist.

Tl:dr I left my microphone on after playing a game with my friends and they heard me watching porn.",Tifu by leaving my mic on
tifu,"This actually happened on Monday. It's a long story. Hopefully it's worth a read and someone gets some amusement out of my stupidity. TL;DR at bottom.  I was on a road trip and turned off the highway to see a ghost town. I was on a graded dirt road that seemed well maintained, so I felt fairly confident it was safe to travel. About 12 miles out from the highway, I saw a car parked on the side of the road a little further up and was surprised someone else was there. Before I could think much of it, I hit a patch of deep mud and got firmly stuck in it, high center style.

I got out and slogged over to the other car but there was no one in it. There were floor mats under the tires. An ice scraper, snow brush, and screwdriver were scattered in the mud next to the car. I realized the car had been there a long time. It had out of state plates.

My boyfriend and I spent about four hours unsuccessfully trying to dig ourselves out. We could hear thunder in the distance and see dark storm clouds creeping towards us the entire time. It got colder as late morning turned to afternoon. When it started to rain, we got in the car. We were covered in mud. The mud was so caked into the zippers on my boots that I couldn't take them off. I was stuck in my mud-crusted pants and shoes. The rain stopped and we decided to hike out to cell phone reception and call a tow truck. We packed up food, water, warm clothes, rain gear, sleeping bags, and tent (luckily we were camping this trip and had our gear in the car). As we hiked out, it showered on us once but the storm held off. 

We walked about nine miles before we saw a lifted pickup towing a side-by-side and some dirt bikes in a trailer. They didn't have a winch or chain to pull us out. The cab was full but they drove us out to the highway in the truck bed. We called for a tow, but no one would come out there because they didn't want their tow trucks to get stuck too.

We were 30 miles from the closest town. We tried to hitchhike but no one wanted to pick up two mud-covered travelers with no car on the side of a rural highway. Night fell. Finally I called the sheriff to pick us up. We stayed the night in a hotel and found someone willing to tow us in the morning. They told us we would have to wait about five hours for the tow. And there were cars stuck on that road that were impossible to get out until later in the season, so they could not guarantee success. Oh, and it would cost about $1000.

They finally picked us up and our driver was a super nice guy with lots of outdoor adventure stories. When we turned onto that fateful dirt road, the driver stopped and called his partner because he wasn't there. It turned out his partner had gone out a little earlier and saw another car stuck on a different road, and tried to help them while he was waiting for us. He got the tow truck stuck in the mud. We turned around and went to help the partner, but he was firmly stuck. Our driver told us it would likely take four or five hours to get the truck out and took us back to town. He told us to get another night at the hotel.

Did I mention I had to catch a plane at an airport that was 300 miles away the next day? I was only coming for half of the road trip and then going back to work. My boyfriend was picking up a couple buddies when he dropped me off at the airport and continuing on for another week. I was stressing hard.

Thankfully, after another eight hours of tension, they finally called to let us know our car was out! While they were pressure washing mud out of the undercarriage and tires, the drivers told us stories about the other people who had made this mistake before us. Several had died of exposure earlier in the year. Two had to be search-and-rescued out (they had a satellite phone to call for help). Others had damaged their cars trying to get unstuck. We were lucky to be alive, unhurt, and with a relatively undamaged vehicle.

Even after the pressure washing, there was still mud in the wheels and undercarriage. We went to the local car wash and used the brush to get as much out as we could. We slept for three hours and hit the road to the airport. There was so much mud still in the wheels the car was unbalanced and shook when we drove more than 60 mph. But we had to drive faster to get to the airport in time. It was a harrowing drive through empty desert with plenty of time to worry if there were other problems with the car. But we made it! I caught my plane and my boyfriend picked up his buddies and is still on the road.

TL;DR Got my car stuck in the mud on a rural road. It took a nine-mile hike, 36 hours, and $900 to get it out.",TIFU by trying to see a ghost town
tifu,"Today i fucked up after the girl i love (lets call her V) said that our first date would have to wait because her german final was longer than she expected and couldnt get to where we agreed on and said i shouldn't wait for her to get there, so i asked the friends i was with if they knew where to get a drink in that area. We found a classic Bogotan bar (I'm colombian so this made me homesick) and after a couple of beers i asked the bartender if he had a colombian drink called aguardiente which has the magical effect of fucking you up massively in like 3 shots.

Two one liter bottles later i pulled put my phone to look at facebook or something and ended up sending V a message saying i was with some mutual friends but after she didn't answer i put up an instagram stories saying ""she didn't arrive :c"" showing us all with shots in our hands. What i didn't know is that one of the people i was with had just texted V saying that i was really mad that she stood me up (i wasn't mad at all) and she took it the wrong way and ended up calling me later on crying and saying that we wouldn't ever work and that she had given up on relationships before she met me and that now knowing she couldn't trust me she's going through with her plan to leave the city for awhile and that shouldn't talk to her again.

tifu,"Obligatory ""this was not today"" but was actually just over a year ago.

It was May 1st, 2018. I had big plans, and my stepson was involved in them. He was an excitable kid, just 4 years old. He knew his role, I had explained it to him well enough.

""In the morning, but after mummy has had her breakfast, i want you to tell her you have a surprise for her. Tell her to close her eyes, then give her this. It's a really big secret though so you can't tell her.""

He agreed and all was good. The morning arrived, and so did she, my girlfriend, and his mummy. She sat at the table, had her breakfast. I made idle talk over the table to her. The little man watched her a little more intently than I realised.

The moment she finshed her breakfast, (bear in mind she was still in her pyjamas) he looked up at me and said as loudly as a 4 year old says everything they ever say, ""CAN WE GIVE HER THE RING NOW?""

Oh fuck. Suddenly all my plans flew from my head. I barely heard her ask ""what did he just say?"" before I frantically shouted ""NOTHING. HE SAID NOTHING."" Then to the child ""fine, do it now.""

So he turned to his mummy and with a smile on his face and a voice as sweet as anything said ""mummy, i have a surprise for you. Close your eyes"". And she did. He placed the ring box in her hand, and when she opened them she went utterly silent. Shocked, eyes wide, she didn't breathe for maybe a minute. Part of me thought we had killed her.

Then I was able to mumble out a very vague sort of ""yeah... erm... Do you want to... Will you marry me?"" Which was very much not what I actually wanted to say, but the surprise and stress of the situation now just threw all my plans into a jumble in my head, and the words just came out completely full of fuck. 

And she said yes. She witnessed this absolute shambles of a proposal and said yes anyway.

Not sure if this even belongs in TIFU because it still ends happily, and it was my son that caused it, but then I probably caused it by trusting a 4 year old to show some restraint.

TL:DR - Trusted my stepson to be an integral part of a wedding proposal. He came out of left field and ruined my plans (as kids often do) but she still said yes.",TIFU by trusting a 4 year old

I just read a post about the dude that bluetoothed porn to his car, and I just had to one up him.

 ‘Twas a splendid night, calling for a wank, and I find a perfect, yet aggressive video for the occasion. For one reason, pornhub decided it would be a great idea to have a chromecast function on their mobile streaming services. So mid scrotal massage, I twitch suddenly, phone in hand, hitting the chromecast button and instantly streaming porn to the tv downstairs, the one that my dad had been recreationally viewing at that exact time. After hearing a knock on the bathroom door, my heart plummets, and I walk downstairs and the porn video was still playing on the tv, salt in the wound right? And so my father stands, his face ranging between shocked at my stupidity and grinning at the fact that I’m standing there red faced with no idea how to turn it off. Yea so for the next month my dad called me pornhub boy so there’s that. Thank fuck my mom was out and about or else I’d have to resort to being a monk for a year to repent for the immense sinning that occurred that day. I’m sorry you had to read this.

tifu,"This didn't happen today. It happened many moons ago in 1995. I've debated telling this story for 4-5 years, ever since I first discovered Reddit and the land of people fucking up in glorious fashion. I used to always stumble into the memory when sex stuff wasn't allowed on TIFU, then forget about it by the time the weekend rolled around. Today is the day! I swore I'd take this shit to the grave, but you guys won't tell anyone and this is a throwaway for the most obvious reasons on our planet.

Before half of you were probably even born. 1995. I was fifteen. Windows '95 was replacing Windows 3.1. I didn't know ANYONE with the internet, much less have it myself. We had 14.4 KBs modems and Bulletin Boards (BBS) that you could dial into once your parents were asleep. My friends and I traded 3.5 Floppy Disks with ONE single porn image on them and it took forever to load it, longer to download, and it was way too scary to keep those on the family computer. The only video porn I had seen in my life was a couple of old VHS tapes that my friend had of his parents having sex. (Yes, I know. Don't...Just don't.) The one thing I did have, my jizz covered prized possession, was an old sex toy magazine that I found in my Dad's closet. They had a few pictures of naked ladies in there and it was glorious.

What it also had was a picture of this: https://imgur.com/a/ue0e3yM

That strange device had been floating around my house longer than I had been alive. I remembered it being in my mom's nightstand when I was in elementary school. After we moved to the new house, it ended up in my dad's dresser. He used it to massage his back sometimes. I truly had no idea what it really was, until I saw it in that sex toy magazine. They labeled the items and cup on the far left side of the picture? It was labeled ""penis cup"" and my imagination went wild. I thought about it for a few months before I finally ended up in the house alone and had a chance to go get the ol' family vibrator from my dad's dresser.

If I told you it was glorious, that would be an understatement. I couldn't stand putting my Magic Johnson it, cause it was too strong and I was too sensitive, but I could certainly rub that cup all over my winkie dinkie and blow huge loads. I became addicted in an instant. It was the best feeling in the world. It was better than letting the jets in the pool blast my junk, which was the closest thing to a girlfriend I had before I proposed marriage and committed my life to the family vibrator.

Here's the fuck up... I was obsessed with that thing. Every single time my parents were out of the house, I was going to pound town with the family vibrator. I busted my nut, cleaned it up, and put it back where it was supposed to be. Until the day my dad came home early... He walked down the hallway, turned the corner, and saw his baby boy on the floor making sweet love to the family vibrator. We made eye contact and I died inside. I quickly covered my wild stallion, turned 50 Shades of Red, and he walked away.

All I could do was get dressed and put it back where I found it. He just kind of looked at me with those disapproving fatherly eyes when I finally got the courage to walk into the living room and my only response was. ""I don't do it much..."" He didn't respond. We never spoke of it again.

I would have much rather been blasting some incest porn...

tifu," 

Didn't happen today, but many moons ago when I was a young child around the age of seven. It was a hot summer and me and a bunch of other kids were playing hide and seek.

My friend and I were hiding behind an apartment complex right next to a hill. I was looking around the corner of the building further up the hill from my friend who was keeping watch at the bottom. After a while he got bored and started heading up the hill towards me. Halfway up he apparently stopped and found something in the grass. At the same time I saw the seeker coming our way so I started running down the hill. I didn't want to shout and give away our position so I simply ran into my friend and gave him a small push to let him know that we should be going.

Unfortunatly, at the same second that I ran into my friend he picked up the shiny object that he found in the grass. Which happened to be a very sharp knife. A very sharp knife indeed, that went straight into my shin.

I didn't notice it until I was down the hill and going around the corner. Thats weird I thought, why does it feel like I just stepped into a pool of water? I pulled up my pant leg and discovered that my sock was bright red, pulled it up further and found a huge gash, splurting out blood. Lucky for me my friends mom was a nurse, we took the elevator up to their apartment and she stopped the bleeding and called my dad.

When he came to pick me up he asked if I really wanted to go to the emergency room and stay there in the heat all day, or go home where we had some bandages and he could fix me up himself. Little dumb me thought ""man, lets go home, the emergency room sounds boring"". Unbeknownst to me this also meant spending the next couple of weeks painfully ripping up the wound every morning since we didn't take care of it properly. Still to this day I can get a small sting of pain in my left shin, where there is a huge scar.

tifu,"Obligatory this happened a couple years back. 

When I was in college, one of my close buddies invited me to ride over to University of Alabama and party with his fraternity buddies and stay at their place for the weekend. I’m all in because I have nothing else going on. 

We make the drive and pull up at the frat house and they already have a party going so we jump right in. The group of 6 of us gets introduced to the friend of a friend whose place we are sleeping at and ask to see the arrangements for the night. 

The gracious host shows us to his quarters and as we walk in, we realize that there is no fucking way we are all fitting in this guys room. This is when I learned my lesson to do due diligence with sleeping arrangements because there was barely enough room for this guy to live in this place, let alone half a dozen extra people. But the night is young, and we were college students. 

As the night went on, we found another friend that was willing to house us in his apartment-style dorm for the night even though he was out doing his own thing and we hadn’t met him. We go do our drinking, and when we decide it’s time to turn in, get directions to the place and roll in HOT. We are all in Tuscaloosa for the first time, so we are SLOSHED. 

We head into this guys place and immediately head for the bathrooms. Every bedroom door is locked (These dorms had a kitchen/living room area right when you walk in and off to the side, bathroom mirror and sink right outside the bedroom doors) so we all just piss in the sinks. I mean this is our buddies frat friend, he won’t care. 

We all setting up in the living room to watch some basketball on the TV, and one of our friends sits down in one of those bungie chairs and just breaks right through it. Fuck. Okay well we owe the guy $50 alright whatever. 

We chill in his place for like an hour and then my friend gets a call from his friend. 

“Hey man, just got home. Where are you guys?”

“What do you mean? We are in your living room?”

“...uh... no you aren’t. Haha are you pulling my leg?”

“...uh...no... we are all here right now. Are you pulling MY leg?”

“Yo dude idk what shit you’re on, but I’m in my dorm and it’s empty so do with that information what you please”

Our friend (who isn’t the brightest) relays this information to us and we all slowly realize that we are in some random persons dorm. Apparently there is a building with the same name right across the way from the one we are in and we weren’t exactly paying attention to details and went to building 1 instead of building 2. 

We all drop everything we are doing and get the absolute fuck out. All drunk as hell, we were not looking to meet the owner of the dorm that we pissed all over, ate their food, and broke their shit. 

Never faced any consequences for these mistakes but if you lived in Presidential Village in 2016 and came home to the smell of piss, missing food, and a broken chair, I am eternally sorry.

I’m finished within 50 minutes so I’m sitting there, looking around, not really doing much. After 10 minutes go by I decided to move my table forwards as it was on my legs and I wanted to move them. This is where my first fuck up happened. Whilst moving the table I managed to unclip the legs from the top of the table. I put the table back down and the thing collapsed like a bag of flour, sounded like one as-well. The loudest bang I have ever heard filled the silent exam hall and everyone’s eyes a staring at me.

So there I am sat there with 200 people looking at me like Im an idiot, I attempt to fix the situation by leaning down picking up the desk and re clipping it, I thought I fixed it so I placed it back down. I hadn’t fixed it. It folded again and made an even louder bang. People are trying to contain there laughter, invigilators are staring at me with hatred in there eyes.

tifu,"As with most TIFU's this happened not today, but about a year ago. 

I should first clarify that my girlfriend is prone to having seizures. Prior to this instance I had only known she previously had seizures, but was never present during one.

So one night my girlfriend was sleeping over, it's about 2am and one of us must have woken the other up from turing in their sleep. Regardless, we're both pretty horny and start going at it. We're spooning and doing the hanky panky, the laziest way to have sex. My lower arm is slid underneath her neck and grabbing a titty, but at the same time causing some slight compression of her neck (this is important for later). 

Now here's where things went south. My girlfriend is no slouch when it comes to stretching the chocolate starfish, so after a while I decided I wanted to change it up. Slowly, we start our journey taking the dirt road home but not even 30 seconds into she lets out a strange cough and goes into full blown seizure.

Surprisingly I managed to stay calm and immediately called 911 explaining everything that's occurred so far, while also trying to get my girlfriend dressed before the paramedics show up. After a couple minutes her seizing stopped, which evolved into a really strange breathing pattern, followed by her attempting to talk to be but not making coherent sentences. At this point I have the 911 responder asking me what the situation is, my girlfriend making incoherent sentences sounding like she's trying to ask me questions, and not cooperating with me to get some underwear and a shirt on. 

It only took maybe 7 minutes for some fire fighters to show up first where they started attempting to get information out of her. A few minutes after that the ambulance showed up and took over. They recommended she come down to the hospital to get checked out. So into the boo-boo bus she went and I followed in my car.

Unbeknownst to me, during the drive she was attempting to downplay to the paramedics the severity of the seizure, and having a breakdown because seizures are typically reported to the Ministry of Transportation which has the ability to take her license away. She had recently just been given it back after not having a seizure for over a year.

Once I arrived at the hospital the paramedic explains to me what my girlfriend has said and says he's told the same to her doctor. The doctor asks for the circumstances surrounding the seizure, and I explain what we were doing and the way we were positioned. He then assumes that my telling of having my arm wrapped around her neck was actually me downplaying choking her during sex, and makes the call the my gf didn't actually have a seizure, and instead got too choked out and went into a coughing fit. He suggested to me that I take it easy with the choking and sent us on our way. I wasn't going to argue... 

So we never really found out what caused the seizure that night (and never found out why she's had them in general), but it sure made for an eventful night...

tifu,"This happened back about 20 years ago when I was maybe 3-4 years old. My mother and I used to play a game to help me learn my animals by calling each other different animals. For example, she would say “you’re a giraffe” and I would say “mommy you’re a lizard” things of that nature.

So my mother and I were in Stop n Shop and this behemoth of a woman comes up to me and starts pinching my cheeks and says “you’re a cutie”. Apparently “you’re a cow” was not an appropriate response for this scenario.

I’ve been full time for about three months now. I hit/exceed my numbers every week and have been killing it according to my supervisor. 

Yesterday however,  my supervisor was out. People started leaving early and talking to each other. I decided to put Spider-Man: Homecoming on while kind of doing some work. Before I put it on, my trainer came over to my desk to look over my numbers and said I was crushing it and to keep it up. 

He comes over to talk to me again and saw it playing on my bottom monitor. 

“Is this the trailer or full movie?” He asked. Not wanting to lie and get caught, I said it was the full movie and that I kind of hit a slump. He said I was good. Then he came back and told me and another new guy that we could wrap up and head home early. 

My trainer and supervisor are both really chill. As I was heading out, he joked about how I could finish watching at home. Do you guys think this was passive aggressive and that he’ll be letting my supervisor know? Really hope I don’t get fired.

So we usually play games together because we’re often bored, we play a lot of Mario Kart because you know, it’s a pretty fun game and because he keeps on trying to win against me. 

So this one night we had a couple of guests and I always told them that E (my flatmate) always loses and never wins. But that night for some reason I lost pretty terribly and my guests were laughing in my face so my ego didn’t exactly let that go easily, increased by my explosive blood pressure. So I went to my room and in a fit of anger I power launched my phone to the wall forgetting that it was a pretty thin wall. Next thing I knew was my phone was stuck in the wall, and in that moment my anger just transformed into worry lol.

My friends felt bad and wanted to go in my room, but I couldn’t let them in now that I’ve created a brand new hole in his apartment. So I just pretended to be ultra pissed and told him to fuck off LOL, while at the same time google-ing the price and nearby wall repairers. Currently I’m covering it with a poster even though it’s been a few months, but I’ll definitely get it fixed once I feel like it hehe.

tifu,"So I manage a local restaurant that also does delivery. Today we're slammed with delivery orders and I only have one driver, so orders are up to 40-60 minute wait times. I get a call from a particularly pissed off customer yelling that the driver forgot his chips or something and I tell him all I can do is send him back along with a free cookie, which apparently wasn't enough consolation and he hangs up on me. Two seconds later I get a call from the same number with what seemed to be a poor fake foreign accent wanting to place a huge order. I hang up thinking it's a prank, he calls back, I hang up. This happens about 3 times. An hour later a gentleman with cerebral palsy and a heavy accent enters the store asking why we refused his delivery and explaining that it took a great deal of effort to come all the way there. Turns out the phone number was for the local high school and the angry lad was another teacher. I felt awful and loaded down his order with free sides.

tifu,"I have a bad habit ( uncontrollable one) of answering questions while sleeping with my eyes wide open, sometimes it's relevant and other are just gibberish, most of the time I don't remember anything about it and my family comes to me when I'm awake and tell me about it, at first they didn't believe me but after a few times they started to laugh about it.

So into the story.
Apparently my habit reached another level by handing things while I'm sleeping, one day I woke up by my mom's laughter and seeing my vape is in my hands, the room was dark and she was not wearing her glasses ( which she can't see will without it), she said ""I don't need your perform, I need your ****"", still not recognizing what she wants I take the vape and put inside my handbag and handing her my headphones, she laughs again and says ""no, I need your credit card"" then I gave her what she wanted and she left the room laughing at me, at first I didn't think much of it but after ten minutes I woke up freaking out cause she doesn't know that I vape and I don't want her to know.

She is still laughing about it for a few days but thank God that she didn't notice the vaipe

tifu,"So i [M22] live with my girlfriend [F22] and we are generally really good with each other. Ive been sick the past couple of days with a sore throat and although its better now i still eat the big bag of “Vicks Vapodrops” that i bought at the chemist. 

Today while i was finishing up my studies for an upcoming exam, my girlfriend jumped out of the shower and was sitting on our bed moisturising. So I paused studying to creep up on her and help her moisturise. 

One thing led to another and i started to go down on her while having a Vapodrop in my mouth. Honestly when i started to go down on her I didn’t realise i had it but when i did, i dint stop until she said it felt weird. I honestly did not realise that it would hurt her, i guess i thought since its edible, it wouldn’t make a difference? 

Now she’s mad at me even though i said sorry and i dint realise it would hurt. She says its common knowledge. 

She was mad for a while. We alright now tho.

tifu,"My parents had given work to a welder for a metal door and grill to be made for a store room at my house. And had paid most of the money in advance as he was a small time welder who needed the advance for the materials. My parents are in their 60's and overly polite and soft spoken people. The welder didn't deliver on the day he promised. Next day my mother called he said he has finished the the work and will bring it in an hour and fix it. He then didn't turn up. She again called in the evening he said the same and didn't turn up. The next day again she called and it was the same response. She called thrice that day every time he said he will get it in an hour but never came. Today morning she called that guy again and he didn't pick up. My father then called he said he will come in 10 minutes but never turned up. My parents were discussing maybe he went off with the money and never intended to deliver as another guy had done a few years ago. I thought the same too... I was enraged. I was boiling. I hadnt had my breakfast and it was almost midday and this sent my rage through roof. I called him twice until he picked up and swore dirty things. He is a little lame in one leg. I swore about that too... I don't know where he lives or anything but swore very harshly(all dirty things) and very demeaningly and threatened to beat him up at his place if either didn't deliver or return the money by the evening. He never uttered a single bad word... He said ""Sir, dont worry i will get the work as its done... I have no intention to run away"". He came in the afternoon and DELIVERED. Now I feel like a disgusting piece of shit. I feel nauseous and hate myself. I think I overreacted and swore too much. I feel like crying and the whole day I have been thinking about what I did. I think I am an undeserving bastard who doesn't know hardship or how hard he must have been working to make an honest buck. Also I am thinking would he have delivered had I not called? Am I just a terrible person?

tifu,"This happened last night. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was away on a business trip in a different country, and I was supposed to be away for 3 weeks.  My wife stayed home and looked after our two young children.  We were in frequent contact, and I know she was really missing me, and I was missing her and the kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

Due to something getting wrapped up early on my trip, I ended up only needing to be away for 2 weeks (on very short notice - they were kind of like ""you're going home tomorrow"").  I thought it would be fun/romantic to surprise my wife.  I was looking forward to seeing the look on her face when I walked in the door.  I guess I was picturing those reunion videos that go viral.   What I failed to take into account was that my plane was landing at 11pm, so after clearing customs and everything it would be more like 1 am by the time I got home. 

&amp;#x200B;

My plane lands, and I'm so excited to get home and see my family.  When I get to the house it's completely dark, of course.  I let myself in, and head upstairs.  I opened our bedroom door, and my wife wakes up.  She literally jumped 2 feet out of the bed and screamed when she saw me standing in the doorway.  She just looked so scared.  She recognized me right away, and immediately starting bawling her eyes out.  Thankfully she was happy to see me, and not mad.  But she was shaking and couldn't stop crying for quite awhile afterwards due to the adrenaline/freight I had given her.  I felt terrible and now I can't believe what a stupid idea that was.

tifu,"i live in a different state than my dad and we rarely talk, so he always asks to facetime me.  The time zones are different so it's hard to synchronize our times, so even when I didn't want to do it today because i was tired from work, i obliged and told him we will when I get home.  


Long story short, he has horrible reception and the video always drops out when we facetime.  So as usual, it dropped and i called him back, then it happened a few more times, and after like the 5th time i just said forget it.  I'll talk to him later.  I get that tickling feeling in my pants that lets me know what time it is after a hard week.  


I load up the BBW gangbang porn (don't judge) and have the volume full blast (i get off on the noise).  She's getting deepthroated and exaggerating the slurping just how I like it (no chauvanist).  Obviously in gangbang porn, you can hear multiple voices and moans at a time.  I think this one had at least 20 people and 1 girl.    


After I spill some milk, i clean up and close the window.  I still see the fucking facetime screen with my dad on it.  I panic and close it out.  He was in choppy realtime, so he was there, but the video was lagging and there was no audio coming from his end.  I am not sure if he heard or saw what was going on, but he was clearly still there.  I was masturbating for 15 minutes, so I don't think he'd be on the line that long if he didn't see me (that'd be weird, dad).  Apparently, the last time our call ""dropped"", it was just ""buffering"" or whatever from the bad service and said it would resume when the service wasn't as poor.  I stupidly took the dropped facetime screen as an end call, just like you'd think a phone call does.  When a fucking phone call drops, it DROPS.  It doesn't fucking buffer.  Fuck u, Apple.  


TL:DR - I thought the facetime call shut off with my dad prior to masturbating to loud gangbang porn, but the video just temporarily dropped and was buffering and when I closed out the porn window, my dad was still in the video but lagging.",TIFU by masturbating in front of my dad during a facetime call
tifu,"So, I love my friends deeply and yesterday we were celebration my birthday that is today. They got home, we were listening music and just chilling. 

The rum arrives and is my 20th birthday, so 20 seconds of rum. I like to say I have a really good resistance but that was a lot, still I was good. We went for pizza because we were hungry and on the way we started smoking weed. I was like ""yeah sure, whatever, weed usually doesnt do anything to me"". Should've thought it better. 

I do not smoke weed on a current basis and it's been almost a year since the last time I did it, that and adding alcohol... A dangerous combination. 

So I start feeling badly, my father is coming up at any given time and my mother was freaking out because, in her words, I looked like shit. My head feels dizzy and my body is just feeling like tickles. 

I tell my sister no more, I'm feeling horrible and I need my friends out before my dad gets home and bans them for ever coming near to me again. 5 mins later everyone is going home, I apologize for everything and go to my bed. My dad gets home right after my friends are going out, there's no way in hell my father wouldn't notice that we all weren't on the right mindset. 

My parents have never seen me drunk or high, never ever. I'm their perfect little princess and I never have fucked it up so badly. I'm panicked about it. As the alcohol could be a pass, weed is a hard NO for them. I'm trying to tell myself that I'm young and I'm allowed some craziness sometimes but this time I think I've gone too far. 

I was planning going with my friends to a party on Wednesday, maybe they won't let me go so easily after today or yesterday or whatever. 

That was almost 12 hours ago. I'm still high and somehow still drunk. My head feels awful and I cannot move too fast. Already puke the pizza I ate. Eating high is hilarious. 

Happy 20th birthday to me.

tifu,"Obligatory not today, it was last fall.

A little back ground first, I am absolutely goddamn freakin awful at remembering faces.  I'm decent at names and I can usually figure out what name matches which person based on context (location, who is around them, what they're talking about, general  appearance, etc.) so most of the time I remember people, as long as I don't run into them in a different setting.  

It's the first day of a new class that isn't part of my major, and I don't know anyone there.  To kick things off the teacher gives us an in class assignment and tells us to form groups and get to know each other.  So here's where I fuck up:  I turn to the girl next to me and introduce myself. I smile and say ""Hi, I'm Morgan."" and instead of telling me her name she says ""I know."" and looks upset.

I laugh and say ""sorry, I'm actually kind of bad at faces."" and she says ""no you aren't, you know who I am."" 

I figure she's someone I hung out with once at a party or something but I'm blanking hard. 

I smile again but look her dead in the eye and say ""sorry but I really have no idea who you are."" 

Now she looks really upset and says ""How can you not know me?  You've been to my house!"" 

Now I'm not about to get chewed out by a random just for forgetting a name so I respond 
""so? I've been to lots of houses.""
She says ""oh my God I live on the floor above you!"" 
I say ""sorry I don't remember every neighbors name"" 
She says ""this is the third time we've had a class together!  You have called me by name before, how can you not know me?"" 
I say ""I really am pretty shit at faces but if this is how you react when I introduce myself, then maybe I don't actually want to know your name"" 
Up to this point I don't feel bad for forgetting at all.  I figure I met her at a house party or something but then she says ""You've met my parents"". That reduces the number of people who she could be by a lot and now I understand why she feels like I should know her. I still can't remember though so I just stare at her blankly.
She adds ""we are literally related""
Now I'm all sorts of confused because even if I'm bad at faces I'm mostly certain that I'd remember a cousin, but maybe she's super distant? 
She adds, ""you were at my grandpa's funeral!""
Now I agree with her that I should absolutely know her name.
She adds ""you slept in my brother's bed!"" 
I am now mortified that I don't know her name, but I still definitely don't know who she is.  I keep staring.
She ends with ""Jesus christ Mo, I invited you to my wedding last week.  I gave you the invitation by hand""
Then it clicks.  She's my wife's cousin. I visited with her parents when I drove up to school the year before.
I say ""Hi Alyssa, how have you been?""
She was not impressed.

This happened about an hour ago, and obligatory I am still trying to understand what I saw. In the fall I will be attempting run my first marathon, and because of this I have started my training so not to shit myself in the first 2 miles. Anyways, today was my first day off from work this week so I decided it would be good to go for a bit of a longer run. I ran down to the lake that is a couple miles away from my house and then turned around to start the trek back. About halfway through the run back to my house, I am hit with a fork in the road. I was feeling pretty decent today and decided to go right, making my path home about a mile longer. This is where my fuck up happens.

As I split off from the main road into the neighborhood I start passing a few houses that I don't really bare in mind. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I spot some movement at the upcoming house. I realize it is a little girl, covering her face and running down the driveway. Now, even though I have seen my fair share of horror movies I safely assumed she wasn't going to be followed by Pennywise as it was a beautiful day and 10 in the morning. Scary shit never happens during the day. Then I looked up to the house where she came running from just in time to see an old man smash something into the tree. I couldn't tell what it was at first, but saw that he was wearing work gloves and the item was grayish brown and moving. Then, just as am passing the old man he starts another swing and I realize, while he's holding this item above his head, that it is a half dead FUCKING PIGEON!

Before I can look away he brings that bitch down with the strength of the Mighty Thor. What was once a bird has now exploded into a mush of feathers, blood, and beak. At this point, I audibly gasp and the man looks up to make eye contact with me. In that moment I could sense the fear and sadness going through this poor bastards soul.

There was a salesman at my 'now old' job, let's call him Billy, who had a serious coke problem. Everyone knew about it but didn't do a damn thing. And you know what? That's fine, it's his life. I witnessed him go into the bathroom, heard a bunch of serious snorting, and then he walked out. No toilet flush, no sink and it lasted about 15 seconds. He walked out noticeably tweaking. 

Me being a good worker thought, ""Wow, it's one thing to do drugs, but to bring it in the office and do it, well that is a big no no."" So I reported it to my boss, and he gave him a surprise drug test, and he miserably failed and was fired. That was my fuck up. 

Come to find out him and the owner of the company are friends and I legit forced the company to fire Billy due to proving he brought coke in the office. 

Their reason to fire me was due to my medical condition (Ulcerative Colitis) and that I messed up on paper work...a whole month ago but I know deep down that it was because I got the owner's friend fired.

tifu,"We all know this didn't happen today. Yesterday was the 6 month anniversary of this fu and I think I'm finally willing to come clean to the two people that read this.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'll start with some general background information. As of December 2018 (Time of FU) I had spent the last three months getting to know (biblically and otherwise) a certified snack. I was pretty excited about how much of an upgrade this guy was and was tryin' real hard to not mess anything up, which included not telling him about a certain medical condition.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had ovarian cysts for basically as long as I've had periods, and as many of my fellow cyst-prone ladies know, that shit HURTS. I didn't think to mention it to him bc at the time it seemed mostly irrelevant, and also how do you even approach someone with that information? ""Hello my name is X and my ovaries are busted, tell me about yourself"" just doesn't sound quite right. I'd also become pretty good about powering through the pain after 7+ years of practice so this secret stayed between me and my traitorous ovaries. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of you probably know where this is going.

&amp;#x200B;

The fuck-up:

&amp;#x200B;

On the fateful night of Dec 6th, 2018, I received the classic ""wyd"" text (lets be real, I sent it) and speedily made my way over to his house, ready to head down to pound town bc none of his roommates were home and we'd have the house to ourselves for the night. the first half of this fu comes from my blatant disregard for the cyst I knew my ovary was harboring. I naively initiated this session of adult partner gymnastics, and was immediately confronted with pain as the cyst protested every thrust. Momma ain't raise no quitter though, so I powered through like a champ, and everybody finished, 10s all around. 

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately after though, I knew I fucked up real bad. The pain was super intense to the point where I couldn't even stand up straight and he knew something was wrong the moment I ran and hid in the bathroom. I tried to wait it out, but the longer I was in there the more I was convinced he thought I was taking a shit and I couldn't risk him thinking girls poop so I finally made my shaky exit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm standing in the doorway, hunched like the mythical man from Notre Dame (may our lady in peace), and decide the best course of action is to look him in the eye and say ""don't freak out"".

 (he freaked out)

As we're speeding to the ER I try to diffuse the tension with some ""sex sent me to the ER"" jokes, which hurt to laugh at but helped us calm down a little bit. We get to the ER and they take me back for an ultrasound after I awkwardly explain my situation to the doc, and sure enough, a nut was not the only thing busted that night. Cyst was a goner. There wasn't much they could do other than give me some fluids and pain meds, and within an hour, I am walk-of-shame-ing my way out of the ER. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was mortified. Thought for sure I was gonna be ghosted. Turns out he thought it was hilarious too (after the fact), and we're still going strong six months later. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right?

tifu,"Obligatory didn't happen today, ltr;ftp, a few details changed to not be identified, yadda yadda yadda. Was reminded of this by a similar post.

About ten years ago some friends (a band, some road crew, etc.) and I were spending the night at a friend's place while we were on the road. He was well-off enough to have two homes, and this was one that was currently not being used. He told us over the phone where to find his spare key and that there was alcohol in the cabinet beside his stove.

We arrive, find the key, find the alcohol, put away the groceries we'd grabbed (since we knew he wouldn't have any as he hadn't been at that residence in some months), and about half of our group decide to eat some mushrooms we'd brought with us. The night is going great, everyone is having a blast.

Around three in the morning - midnight for our friend, due to time zones - he gives us a call to check up on us. We report all is well, he talks to a few of us and eventually he's put on speaker. At some point in the conversation, someone mentions the Absolut we've been drinking. This gives our friend pause, and he tells us he doesn't drink Absolut and wouldn't have had any in the house.

Cue the freakout (especially for those of us on mushrooms at the time). Turns out his next door neighbor also uses this residence only during the summer, keeps their spare key in the same location, and stores their alcohol in the same cabinet. We grabbed our things (except the groceries) and got the hell outta Dodge. 

Hope the residents of that house enjoy the random groceries they found next time they returned! Hopefully they make up for the missing bottle of liquor.

tifu,"Ok, just gonna say that this happened around mid 2017( aah the worst year of my life). This story has multiple fuck ups and is hence quite long. 

So,I just finished the second sem of uni and was just enjoying the sem break at home. Im not an outdoor person coz i rarely get out of the house that much ( well mainly coz all my friends are in different parts of the country). So one day my friend who is in another state calls me up and invites me over there to smoke up. So im like ""sure, i should probably travel thousands of kilometres to smoke up with my friend, meh i rarely get out. This should end that complaint"".So i decided to go, i packed my stuff, grabbed some cash and got on the train. The train started its engine and the fuck up began.

So i called up my friend two hours later, updating him on the situation. He informs me that its a 5-6 hour travel and that ill reach approximately at midnight. Then he mentions that he is going to his seniors apartment to smoke up and im like ""cool, have a good time"". I also mentioned  if he or his friends could come pick me up( coz it was late and its my first time traveling this far alone). He says "" ill try to send someone over, but incase that doesn't happen, get an uber. I'll send you the Google map location"". Yea , i knew i was gonna be booking an uber.

Hours pass by and i reach the station ( the most busiest station ive ever seen). My phone's about to die so i find a outlet to plug in my phone. Then I turned on the mobile data so i could book an uber. Suddenly my uni WhatsApp group starts to blow up, so i opened the app  thinking it must be some new meme, and i saw the one thing that strikes fear into the hearts of any Uni student . They even changed the goddamn group name. ""RESULTS CAME!!!"". Im like fuck, the timing couldn't be worse. I let my curiosity get the best of me. I clicked on the pdf and started scrolling, my heart rate at an all time high. I came across my number.. my stomached ached soo bad i couldn't breathe. I had failed  a subject( FUCKKKKKK!!! ). Then the waves of depression hit me. I had promised my parents that at minimum i wouldn't fail a subject, im soo useless. Im out here, miles away from home, lonely and mentally drained. I was in full self loathe mode.

I walk out of the station all depressed, i couldn't think clearly. I try and phone my friend asking if he could come pick me up, but he doesn't pick up. I then proceed to call him again but then i get interrupted by this auto guy who kept pestering me  around for a ride( for those who don't know, autos are 3 wheeled taxis). I was initially planning on booking an uber and charging my phone but i couldn't think straight. I eventually give in and and got in his ride and thus initiating the second fuck up.

So we head out. I kept calling my friend over and over( atleast 17 times), i tried calling his friends, i even called one of his friends who wasn't with him at the time, but no answer. Then it hit me, he did mention about smoking up with his Uni seniors..fuck he must be out cold. Suddenly the auto breaks down in the middle of the street. The guy tries to restart the engine and fails miserably.  To top it all of it started raining. ( Gotta love the timing of all this). The auto guy turns around and says its pointless and that he'll ask his brother to come in his auto and take me to my destination. Then he goes on to demand this ridiculous fare amount and that i have to pay him half and the rest to his brother. That's when i realised fuck these guys are milking me. Ofcourse he knew i was new to this place and that I was the perfect target. So I took out my phone and pretended that my friends took the call and that they said that they will come and pick me up. The auto guy is like "" but he's on the way"" but i insisted. Then this prick started demanding i pay him the half that was promised. We get into an argument and i end up payin him 100 bucks less the amount he asked. After i get out and start walking his auto magically starts working again and the fucker leaves.

So im out here in the cold rain hoping some uber guy will come pick me up. 20 minutes later someone comes over and i get in. I was relieved, finally i can get to the apartment and just forget this whole thing. We approach the destination. So according to the google map location its down a path, but the uber driver doesn't take me there cause the road wasn't tarred. So i ask him for the fare( around 300) but all i had close to that amount was a 500, and he didn't have change. Then he suggests transfering the money via paytm, i didn't have paytm..my friend has it so i gave him his number and asked him to transfer it to him. My mind was too clouded to wait till he made the transaction. I got out and started walking towards the point the map was telling me to go.( So i basically lost the same amount of money i was tryna save from the auto guys)

Unlike my place this place had a lot of stray dogs and they were particularly aggressive. So im walking down the path and in a minute i reach the point. I look up from my fone and i see a half built bare concrete house. There was this homeless dude in the front and some dogs. My friend did mention he had some money problems but i didn't expect it to be this bad. Pretty sure the map was wrong. There was an apartment i passed by to my right. That should have been the one. So i go up the stairs looking for atleast a familiar shoe on the doorstep, i eventually reach the terrace and i did happen to find a familiar shirt my friend owned kept for drying  on the drying line. But it could have been anybody's so i left. I walk around the neighborhood looking at other apartments but all their gates were locked.

 So i returned back to the first apartment but there was a security gaurd this time. I got my friends photo out on my fone and asked him if he  lived there. He said no( was it because the picture had a light teal filter,idk). So i left that apartment and walked around again, only the dogs to keep me company. My phone was about to die. So i came across another apartment with an open gate. I walked in and decided to sleep on the terrace cause the streets weren't safe. As i was about to climb the stairs my phone rang, it was my friend( finally).

 As i had suspected, they had passed out, he apologized but i didn't have the strength to be mad , i just wanted to sleep. Also as it turned it out it was actually the first apartment. The security gaurd i talked to was new there and their regular security gaurd was fast asleep. Just my luck

TL;DR : i traveled 6 hours to meet my friend, I realised i had failed a subject and got conned by taxi drivers, even contemplated sleeping on the roof of some apartment cause said friend was out cold.",TIFU by traveling to a foreign state to meet my stoner friend
tifu,"So, an obligatory this didn't actually happen today, but actually happened a few days ago.

I went to an amusement park with some friends, but they agreed that they'd eat lunch before going on rides, so I decided to go get something pretty delicious but also heavy thinking that it would digest enough in time before riding anything. Turns out I was wrong!

I rode on a bunch of gut-wrenching rides, including several that take you upside down and also leave you weightless temporarily. During those rides I felt my stomach want to go but thankfully it didn't, however I made the error of thinking it had subsided when I got on one of those swinging boat rides.

As the boat started swinging back and forth I felt my stomach start aching more than it had been before but I still thought the boat would ease its rocking before the inevitable happened. Not so! It got worse and worse until I started feeling a bit of my heavy lunch go up my throat and into my mouth. I swallowed that bit, STILL thinking that no more would come up. Again, I was proven wrong.

I covered my mouth, which probably wasn't a good idea, and my lunch projectiled all over, including on the row in front of me, and its occupants were NOT happy. After the ride stopped, I exited the ride in confusion of what just happened, forgetting to check on the occupants of the row in front, and they were furious about that, upset at me for my perceived lack of empathy. I apologized profusely even as they were explaining to me what I should have done at that moment of confusion and complaining about how they had to go to the dry cleaners. They were led away by the park security to prevent things from escalating, demanding reimbursement and still complaining about my fuckup. I hoped never to encounter them again but also that somehow the universe would reimburse them. Thankfully I was able to clean myself up and my friends were able to give me some mental support afterwards.

tifu,"So apparently after doing some (Reddit) research (Google really had nothing to say about the matter whatsoever because I’m the .01%, I guess), I realized just how ineffective the “pinch method” really is. A little background: when I pee, I’m just incredibly lazy, as well as with most aspects of life, so I pee sitting down, because I can’t be bothered with standing up. So I generally sit, pee, pinch the head of my penis, then turn around, un-pinch, then let the last little bit dribble out before I shake twice and not even a bit more because then I’m playing with myself. Well after I’m “done” I feel the terrible urge to go again (sitting while peeing isn’t very effective as a male) as I’m washing my hands. I immediately shove my hand down my pants to pinch the head of my penis once again as I feel a flood of urine coming. Apparently it was too much, and I didn’t “clench my butthole” as I’ve heard so many others do to stop the flow of urine, and I felt this intense, sharp pain in my penis. The second I let go and started peeing a little more, it was basically all just blood. I sat there, dumbfounded, and pulled out my phone to Google what this could be, but really didn’t get any information. I sat there in shock for a little bit, in immense, piercing pain and was breathing really fast. I must’ve scared the piss (literally) out of myself because after a while, I felt the urge to pee again. Once again, it’s just blood coming out, along with ridiculous, pinching pain. The next few pees I’ve had have been fine. The blood is no more, and it just feels like my penis is a little pinched right now which will go away after about a week and I’ll be recovered, so I’m told.

Tl;dr: today I fucked up by pinching the head of my ding-a-ling to stop the flow of urine because I’m a lazy piece of shit who can’t stand up and pee like a normal dude, and ended up bleeding",TIFU by Rupturing My Dick
tifu,"So this happened just now and can't stop thinking about it. TL;DR at the bottom

For context, my boyfriend lives an hour away for college and usually comes home in the weekends to visit me, but this weekend was the exception. He took a shower an hour before this was happening and we were texting and he announced that he was naked, cause he was about to take a shower, I was joking around, saying I didn't believe him and told him to send proof. (we never send nudes or anything, so didn't expect anything) Lo and behold, he took a selfie with half his (naked) body visible, the rest covered by his bathrobe. I laughed and continued texting him. Then I'm off to dinner and the next part begins.

My dad decided that he wanted to go out and have dinner with my sister, her boyfriend and me, since the rest of the family wasn't available. We were about to receive our first course and my dad suggested that we take a selfie to sent to the family textgroup, so I said to use my phone since mine has better quality. My dad struggled with getting his hand positioned to have everyone in the picture and being able to press the button, then it happened. He accidentally clicked on my last received photo and that was of course the semi nude from my boyfriend, and everyone at the table saw it and bursted out laughing. My dad quickly gave the phone back to me, my sister's boyfriend nearly pissed himself from laughing so hard, my sister of course gave backhanded advice to never send nudes or whatsoever, but like this had never happened before. I don't know if I should tell my boyfriend that my dad, sister and her boyfriend saw his naked body.

tifu,"Okay so in history class we were debating on who the most influential person in history is.  The format was each group (we had groups of 2) would pick a person they wanted to argue for.  My group picked Abe Lincoln, and the group we were going up against first picked James Charles as a joke.  After they gave their “argument” it was our turn and I said “the only thing James Charles influenced was influencing straight people to become gay.”  Obviously this was a very bad choice of words, and while I am by no means homophobic, it certainly came across like it.  A couple people laughed, but most were silent.  My teacher got super mad and decided to cancel the whole thing, and instead we had to do a boring writing assignment.  Now the whole class was mad at me and the teacher, who I used to have a great relationship with, hates me.

tifu,"This actually happened last summer and I’m using a throw away. 

My wife and I decided to try doing a 3 way. We always joked around about doing it before but never actually went as far as setting it up. We set up a dating profile as a couple looking for a 3rd. In the bio was the set of rules we had wanted to make clear to anyone who was interested. 

After about thousands of messages from most guys but the occasional girl thrown in we found our “3rd”. He was an average guy who lived a few towns over. Nothing about him set off any red flags and he accepted the rules we had without and pushback. We talked to him for about 2 months just to make sure he was the right pick. 

Around the 3rd month we set a date and booked a hotel room in a city between ours so we had about the same commute. He was cool with meeting at a public spot first so we could talk everything out again just so we were on the same page then go do the deed. 

We decided to meet at a local bar a few blocks away from the hotel. It was a week day so it wasn’t packed. We told him where we were sitting and about 45 minutes after the set meeting time he arrived. 

He looked nothing like he did in his profile. He had a bag with him and when I asked what he had he pulled out about 4 gopros and a few bipods for them. He said he wanted to film it in a few different angles. My wife told him that she didn’t feel comfortable with him filming it and he started to get angry. He started giving us demands and how he wanted things to go. 

He wanted to go back to the hotel with my wife first and then have me come after so he could have his time alone with her. He also said he was not going to use protection and made it clear he would not pull out. At this point I was already over this happening and wanted to leave so I told him I needed to talk with my wife in private for a minute to discuss things. 

We talked and decided this was a big mistake and decided to leave. During the time he was talking to the bartender. We told him we decided we didn’t want to do this anymore and he flipped out. He said we wasted his time and money and that I should just let him go back to hotel with my wife alone to make up for what we did. 

We told him we were sorry but we were just going to leave. He started screaming saying he had a gun in his car and that he would kill us if we left. At this point we were scared for our lives so we sat there for a while trying to calm him down. I’m going to assume someone heard him say he was going to kill us and notified the police because after about 30 minutes of trying to calm him down at the table the police arrived. 

My wife and I had to explain the whole thing to the police about how we were trying to do a 3 way and met up with this crazy guy. At this time he started to get aggressive with the police and they ended up arresting him. Once they took down all of our info they left with him in the squad car. We went and paid the hotel and went home hoping to forget this ever happened.

tifu,"This started about a week or so ago. My grandpa is a very nice man, and a hard working one. He has lived us grandkids to no end and taught us valuable life skills. His skin is also extremely sensitive. Like, five minutes outside without a hat and sunscreen and he’ll burn. I’m also on an ultimate frisbee team, this’ll make sense later. 

So, as I said, this started about a week ago. It was just after breakfast and I was heading to practice. My car is out in our backyard driveway, and to get there you have to walk near the pool. My grandpa was out on the deck, sleeping (with his protection, of course). I saw my grandpa’s straw hat sitting on his bald head and mindlessly grabbed it off his head. I was curious if it would fly like a frisbee (I’m so stupid). I tossed it onto the couch on the porch. Then I didn’t pick it back up and put it back on. 

When I came back from practice, he was still asleep on the deck, without his hat. I realized my mistake and got the hat and put it back on his head.  My practice was like two hours. 

Grandpa’s monthly doctors appointment was yesterday. There is a possibility that he has basal cell cancer. I really don’t know what to think. I’m crying writing this, I had to tell someone

tifu,"So on the well known gay hookup app I prefer to stay discreet as I'm not ""out"". I send pictures of myself, my body and other parts that is, once asked except for when it comes to a picture of my face, I use someone else's. The guy who's pic I use looks enough like me to the point where I've never had someone point out the difference when we meet. Maybe it's because my body pics are accurate, maybe they're worried I may react negatively if they say something - but I really wouldn't.


I graduated college last year and moved pretty far away from the city the school is in. A couple of months ago I was back in town and after a night out, decided to see what, or who, I could get up to that night. I looked on the app and messaged one guy who's profile was a picture of his torso and it looked pretty good. We also traded face pics and he was a good looking dude so I decided to go over to his place.

When I arrive, he says he's at the door so I get out of my car, walk up to see him looking through the glass window in the door, and then he lets me in. That's where the fuck up happens. I instantly recognize the guy. He's someone I know, we graduated together, have many mutual friends, but fortunately never officially met. He had also sent a face picture of someone else, which looks nothing like him may I had. I was surprised that he hooked up with guys, especially because he has had a girlfriend. During our brief period of smalltalk he even said he sometimes has his current girlfriend join his hookups with guys. But anyway I avoided eye contact as much as possible, asked to have the lights turned off, we did a deed, and I dipped out.

Truly this is what I deserve for not sending face pictures that are actually me. Nothing has happened or been said since, but we're definitely going to be at some future event together. We have too many friends that it's inevitable.

tifu,"So this happened today. 

A friend invited us over to her hometown, which is close to the beach. Being a local she knows pretty cool spots. 
However we went to a place where you could drive from not too high. The real issue is that going back up was HARD. There was a rope you had to grab to pull yourself back up out from the water. 

I used to climb so that wasn't too hard for me. However my BF not that kind of person. He is kinda chubby and doesn't exercise. So he was afraid of doing it. But me as the impulsive person that I am. Convinced him that it wasn't that hard and that he would regret not getting into the water.
Anyway he jumps in and everything is fun until he decides he wants to get out. 

He grabs the rope and tries to pull himself up failing big time. And he tries a second time and a third one and he still can't do it. He begins to panic. We try to push him up and that didn't work either.  
There was another way up and we swam to try to take him out. It was the same drill. Rope. Pull. Out. And nope, and the water was rising.  He begins to breathe heavily and a boat drives by making the water less steady. We see some metal stairs that are kind of far but we decide to swim over. 
There were some big wheels tied to the wall. So I grab both ends and use my body as a step for him. He steps and climbs onto the stairs. I follow. 

And boy was he pissed. He was bleeding from his arm and he was all out of breath. He was so mad that he listened to me. And that he had almost died. 

Of course I tries to be understanding but now I feel so guilty and can't sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll admit it, I'm a hairy guy. Especially ""down there.""  If the hair on my head was as thick as the hair in my crotch, I'd be a happier man. Anyway, I like to keep things neat and trim, so about once every month or two I do the deed and do some good, old fashioned manscaping.  I'm very careful and usually have no issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Today was poised to be no different. I pull out my electric trimmer, my grooming scissors, have a seat on the toilet, and begin my work. Things are going good, and I'm about 3/4 of the way done. I start to inspect the twisty hair near where my ballsack joins my taint. Working in such a sensitive area, I opt to use the scissors to complete this area. I hold my balls back and position myself to make a cut to the hair there. Right as I'm making the cut, my hands slip and my ballsack gets caught in the scissors. I try to stop cutting but it's too late! The damage had already been done.

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing I feel is the pain, but didn't see any blood. Initially, I begin to think I'm in the clear and think I may have just  pinched myself or something. I decide to lift up the scissors to inspect them, and that's when I see it. I see a gray-white crumpled PIECE OF FLESH HANGING OFF THE SCISSORS. Y'all. Part of my ballsack skin was hanging off the scissors! A really tiny piece, but STILL! My heart nearly stopped. Then, that's when the blood started. I heard it drip on the floor below where I'm sitting. Grabbed some TP and got the blood flowing to stop after about a minute.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I stopped manscaping and I cleaned my wound, which just caused it to bleed again. After applying  more pressure, the bleeding finally stopped again. It's been about  6 hours now, and it's sore as heck where I cut myself. Hoping the pain goes away soon.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I'm an idiot and cut my ballsack while trimming my pubes. I bleed and skin hung off the scissors. No more bleeding but still sore.

tifu,"*Throwaway account because that's where this fuck up deserves to be buried.* 

This happened yesterday. I was watching porn on my phone, one of those daddy/daughter videos. I will state, for the record, I do not advocate incest. My girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in ""bad dad"" mode when she sees me this weekend. All I wanted was to be the best bad dad she ever had, so I went on pornhub for some incest-inspiration. That's all this was. Research. 

So, the ""daughter"" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. Of all people. If there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment I look straight into it. I answered the phone. The old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.

Cut to my dad and I driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. Then, there came the silence. It wasn't the awkward kind. But I guess we just kinda said enough at the time. My father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. He was in the mood to get jiggy with Jeezy. But instead of hearing voices worshipping the OG upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital Q&amp;A: 

*""You like fucking me don't cha, daddy?""* 

*""Arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... ""* 

My old man unknowingly activated the car's Bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever I was listening to last. In this case, it was fucking incest porn. Now, I never closed the video before I left the house, but I did pause the motherfucker. Yet, somehow, my phone went Skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.

I frantically turned off the ""radio"" and did what I do best in extremely uncomfortable situations, prevent eye contact at all cost.

tifu,"So this is one of those rare posts that actually happened today,

more specifically this happened around an hour ago. I'm in the process of flipping the fuck out right now and my heart rate will not go down. So, without any further ado let's dwell into this fuckfest.

Earlier tonight I was swiping on Tinder and I matched with this girl, incredibly hot with a gorgeous body. She texts me first, we have a small conversation before she suggests we move to IG. I was a bit suspicious seeing how her instagram had 50-odd followers, and with the way she looked that's unheard of, I thought to myself ""What's the worst that could happen?"" and sent her a message saying I was me from Tinder.

We message for a short while and after some small talk she asks me if I'm horny, I tell her I'm not and ask her to make me horny, thinking we could have some good ol' fashioned fun. She sends me a video of her kissing, biting her lips, and playing with her tittes, then she asks me to show her how I'd lick her tits and also to show her my dick. I'm currently thanking the lord that I didn't think with my man downstairs and start kissing the air for her, I did however show her my dick. I don't want to go into too much detail here, but I tell her it's still soft and ask her to try harder. She sends me a similar video and once again asks me to do the same thing back.

Despite her flaming hot body I was still very suspicious, but I figured if anything would happen she'd eventually just send me a virus link and I'd block her and that's that. To lower my suspicions I ask her to send me a selfie of her holding a spoon, just to make sure she wasn't a catfish. The reply I got was not what I expected, she sent screenshots of our convo (Which may not seem like a big deal from what I've wrote here, but I went into quite a lot of detail on what I wanted to do to her), along with screenshots of my facebook friendslist, asking me to send her $1000, or else she'd send these screenshots to everyone I know.

My heart instantly sinks, then it starts pounding, my hands start trembling slightly and I tell her to wait as I grab my laptop. I instantly log onto facebook and try to figure out how to disable my account. I'm completely lost in the shitty interface for the settings menu. I googled very quickly and luckily managed to do it relatively fast. I grab my phone and she's texted me ""Is it a yes? I can ruin your life faster than you'd imagine"" or something along those lines, I unfollow her instagram, remove her follow from my instagram, and lastly block her before going on Tinder to remove her from there as well.

With her removed from everything I go to text one of my closest friends about the fuck up when I get a notification, a message from the Instagram \*that I just blocked\*. She asks me if it's a yes or a no, I unblocked her and this time turned off chats and video calls for good measure, then reblocked her again.

It's currently 6AM and I can't sleep, I'm still fearing tomorrow. If she does go through with her threats, talking with my mom and family will be fun.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I sexted a girl from Tinder, when trying to confirm wether or not she was a catfish she threatened to send screenshots of our explicit conversation to my entire facebook friends list unless I sent her $1000. I'm freaking out and I have absolutely no idea if she actually went through with her threat.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Nearly 2 days have passed since the threat, and as far as I can tell she did not go through with it. No one has reached out to me about it, and I did ask my mom, brother, grandparents and closest friends if they received anything, I explained the situation to my closest friends and we had a good laugh about it, so all is well. Thanks to everyone for your support! All your lovely comments have helped me tremendously!",TIFU By talking dirty to a girl from Tinder and getting blackmailed.
tifu,"This is one of the most fucked up things I've done so I thought I'd share it here.

So basically this one girl in our class hasn't been going to school in almost a month, and today she finally returned.

Everyone else kept asking her what was wrong and why she took such a long break. Most of them thought she had a serious fever, some thought she was having family issues, and some thought she was just having a vacation.

None of them were right.

This is where the fuck up happens. Brace yourselves.

Minutes after, her entire family entered the classroom. Her mom looked like she was about to tear up, while her dad was comforting her.

Everyone kept asking her what happened. Then she finally spoke. She told the whole class that she had a severe case of breast cancer. Before she could add any more details, I, trying to be the Chad that I'm not, cut her off and let out a huge ""pfffffttttt"".

Everyone was staring at me as if I just killed someone. At first I was confused as to why nobody was laughing. That's when I realized that she was for real. I have now activated 'what the fuck have I done?' mode.

I don't know why the actual fuck I decided to do that. Being the moronic baffoon that I am, I thought that she was just joking, because in my mind I thought that if she actually had cancer, she wouldn't be going to school. God I've never been so wrong in my life.

What's worse is the fact that I proceeded to make fun of her even more. I asked her where the hidden cameras were. I asked her why she decided to bluff out something like that.

Not even 10 seconds in and she starts tearing up. I have now become the worst person in the eyes of everyone in the classroom.

Skip to 30 minutes later, everyone is angry at me, the girl was accompanied by her friends and family to go home. I'm sitting at the principal's office, begging the faculty not to tell my parents about what happened, because it'd be the end of me.

They said they wouldn't tell my parents if I apologize and participate in community service (cleaning, organizing schedules, etc.). I agreed, since I'm used to those kind of stuff, and because I really didn't want my parents to know.

Skip to now. I'm at home, laying in my bed, banging my head against my desk and regretting my life choices. I just pray to God that the girl is okay. I don't think I'll be able to live with myself for the next few months after what just happened.

Tl;Dr - I made fun of a cancer patient in our school because I thought she was bluffing, paid the price by participating in community service, my regret levels are at an all time high. Never doing that kind of shit again.

tifu,"This really happened today, but the story requires a leap backwards.

In 2016, I was diagnosed with a rare heart condition known as Atrial Ventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia, or AVNRT for short. I have had two ablation procedures and we believed they effectively corrected this condition permanently.

For further background, my dad died suddenly of a heart attack in November. Shortly after, my step mom saw a medium.

I've never been very religious, or subscribed to any one sense of spirituality, so I went it relatively skeptical.

The medium told my step mom three things that stuck out to me specifically:
1. My dad saw that I was with him when he died- he knew he was not alone.
2. He knew that I was wearing his watch from the moment I found him, and he was okay with the fact that I'd taken it. He was flattered.
3. He said I needed to return to my cardiologist, and that my condition would return.

I thought this as all a little too hoaky, and did not heed his, or the medium's, warning.

This morning, I went into the ER with abnormal sinus rhythms once more. My doctors had previously told me there was less than a 3% chance of a reoccurrence; still, Dad knew.

Next time, I'll listen.

TLDR; my dead dad told me to see a doctor through a medium, I ignored it, it bit me in the ass.

Note: I am safe and sound at home now and am returning to my cardiologists on Monday for tests!",TIFU by not believing a medium

It was technically yesterday, wanted to post earlier but was too busy playing games when I was finally able to enjoy it again.

I have been experiencing issues with my fps since around February. My pc was overall also a lot slower. So this morning I started up my pc, in the mood for a few games of league of legends. When I looked up at the pc screen, it said something about not finding the device so it can not start windows. I reset my BIOS to default settings the previous night, hoping that somehow that might get my fps above the 40 mark on league. It was not successful.

Anyway, I had to change my ssd back to the primary drive, but before I did that and exited the BIOS, I was looking around a bit. When I got to my cpu, I noticed it was running at 70 degrees, I thought it was hotter than it was supposed to be, and thought maybe that could be the problem. I called my dad, he also said that is fairly high, when he came home he said we should open the box, we opened it, turns out the cpu fan was broken, the only things that has been keeping the cpu ""cool"" since February was my other pc fans.

I ask the intern where she goes to school, find out her school is in the same sports conference as mine but a lesser college, so I egg on her about that. She's hitting the ball back into my court and all seems normal and smooth. By this point, I'm feeling smug that we're giving the good impression.

&amp;#x200B;

And on the paperwork all she has left is to sign and date it. I'm talking to the senior engineer and wasn't thinking too much at this point, kinda on autopilot conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Intern: ""Is June six?""

Dumbass me, overtly animated: ""Dude! You're a nuclear engineer! You should know that by now.""

And my dumbass reflexes turned to the staff engineer and said ""Dude, I'm so disappointed in your intern man"" with a smug smile thinking I was being funny.

&amp;#x200B;

She didn't say a word after that.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that day, I ran into the other staff nuclear engineer and was gonna egg him about what I thought was a funny remark. Thankfully they all have a sense of humor, and he said, ""Haha, what if she was asking if it's June sixth?"" And all the little gears start to click in my head and I haven't felt that embarrassed and like a dick in a while. And as the staff senior hears the gears click, starts laughing.

&amp;#x200B;

Feeling bad, and knowing I'd run into their group the next day, I figured I'll let her know that I misunderstood and was a dumbass and apologize for it. But I found out that she called in sick. And having gone through a serious rough patch myself, I'm wondering if I hit the wrong chord and probably fucked it up real bad. Or maybe it was coincidence. Worst thing is that I don't have the balls to actually reach out to her to apologize for the smartass remark and actually find out how she actually took in the remark. I'm hoping she took it as banter. Right now, I'm gonna wait it out until I run into her and apologize then.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Tried to make interns feel at ease with what I thought was funny banter and my bad hearing probably caused me to make her feel bad 4 hours into her internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: First off, sorry for the delay in the update. The company treated the interns to a dinner and all of us stayed out longer than I thought I would...

&amp;#x200B;

So, the first thing in the morning, I did go look for her and did let her know that I'm sorry about what happened. I let her know that what I intended and that after a while, I realized that I could actually have stepped over the line and may have been a dick (didn't say that, but used professional words). I told her that I thought I heard what I heard and acted the way I did, but others have told me that she may have said it differently and that I probably did misheard it.

&amp;#x200B;

She laughed it off and told me that she knew that I was joking and meant nothing by it and wasn't offended by it. And since I had a meeting to go to, went about our merry ways.

&amp;#x200B;

So, thankfully, it was taken the way I hoped it was. And now I have learned some lessons for sure...Finally at peace knowing that I wasn't a complete dick.

&amp;#x200B;

And thanks for the feedback everyone, I genuinely appreciate it! You guys are weird, but at least you guys are reddit weird.

tifu,"So as with most TIFU this happened a few years ago but I only feel in able to talk about it now.

Growing up I was/still am a big David duchovny fan, in school we were given a project to do on our heros and I chose David. Now this wouldnt be an issue except for the fact when I first read his name I misread it as David Dutchaveny,pronounced like its spelt. I did a 15 minute presentation and not one person corrected me and for years when I saw his name it never registered to really look at his last name.

Fast forward a few years later and I see online that theres a contest to meet David in my hometown,to win you just need to explain why you should meet him,I enter,explain my manhood of him and win.

Queue the day to meet him,I'm all excited,I'm wearing a shirt with him on it,x-files hat and californication bag. The manager for him has me waiting outside and says I'll be meeting him in a minutes,he tells me hes explained to him I'm a big fan and hes delighted to meet me. I go in and I'm star struck, hes standing in beside a poster with him and his name on it, I go over to him and being all polite as I'm not sure how casual hell be about being called his first name,I say ""man it's an honour to meet you Mr. Dutchaveny,I've bee a huge fan since I can remember. Is it ok if I take a photo with you Mr. Dutchaveny?

What happened next as the most awkward 10 seconds ever, hes manager heard and leaned into my ear and says ""hes name is Duchovny"". I look over at his poster, read the name and it hits me,it sinks in, the school project, the contest entry, my entire life I've been pronouncing his name wrong.
Michael Scott wouldnt have embarrassed himself this much,the curb you enthusiasm music doesnt justify the awkward tension that followed. 

David and his manager both gave me the weirdest looks and I just had to nope out of there quick as I could. I've never been so embarrassed before or since.

TL:DR spent my life saving David duchovnys name wrong,met him and he found out first hand","TIFU by being the biggest David duchovny fan,meeting and realising I've been pronouncing his name wrong my entire life"
tifu,"So this happened just hours ago and I really need to let this out because if I don't, I might break down in front of my family. 

This cousin of mine, we don't really get along. He has an air of arrogance and an inferiority complex to match. He will always one up anyone in any conversation and will bring up any of his ""accomplishments"" in every chance he can. Let's call him S.

I've always dreaded interacting with him because of this. I've been a victim of being put down one too many times. One time when we were kids, he threw a tantrum during my birthday party because he wants to sit at my place. My mother made me relinquish the chair just so he can sit on it and stop screaming. He even blew out my birthday candles. Also during my elementary graduation, he made me take off my medals just so he can wear them on his neck. He went up the stage screaming at his mother to take a picture of him. 

Yeah I don't really like him. I thought now that we're older he'll grow out of it but no. He kept rubbing it in my face that he had more girlfriends than me and that he can draw better than me. Yeah both of those things are true but come on. No need to rub it on my face. 

So this is where the fuck up begins.

My siblings, cousins, and I are having a drink. Catching up on each other's lives and monkeying around. Somehow we came upon the topic of blood groups and the corresponding attitudes along with them. As previous studies show, the theory has already been debunk but we matched them up with our own blood types anyway. My blood type is B and it says that B blood type people live in their own worlds. 

""Maybe that's why you're such an airhead."" Said S.

I know that its the alcohol working but I got really pissed that he called me an airhead. I don't know what happened but all I can feel is anger. I stood up and yelled, ""At least I'm not adopted.""

I said this because a chose a course where blood is the bread and butter of the job. So I studied cytology and genetics for two semesters. S's blood type is AB. His mother is type A and his father is type O. Where did that B come from? So I just assumed that he's adopted. 

He got up on my face and hurtful words were exchanged a lot of cussing at each other where it almost escalated into a fight if it wasn't for my brother and our other cousins holding us back.

I was so confident that he was adopted that I said, ""I'll give *equivalent of a thousand dollars* if you can prove that you are not adopted."" 

He grinned and agreed. Come next morning my brother informed me about my little wager and the amount that I'm willing to give away. I just shrugged and hopefully the ass would forget about it.

Well fuck me, come Saturday and I heard about S and his family. The results came back and his dad is not his biological father. It turns out my aunt, his mother, has been having an affair with a car salesman for years now. 

They told us that the screaming match was brutal and his younger siblings are coming to our house for a couple of days. S's father is planning to test his other children. 

I saw S's siblings faces. They were crying non-stop and asking when can they go home and have their parents made up yet. I don't know what to do. I didn't mean for this to happen. I only want to make him feel bad. I didn't want to his siblings into this. I really thought that he was adopted. 

So now I'm dreading the moment S opens his mouth about my involvement in this mess.

TL;DR: I don't like my cousin. Got drunk told him he was adopted. Made a bet that he's adopted. He lost. His parents are now fighting. Dreading at the time that he'll rat me out to my parents.",TIFU by yelling at my cousin that he's adopted.
tifu,"I originally posted this in r/cringe but was advised it was more of a tifu.. 

I was at a theme park queuing to get a drink from the vending machine. 

As I rummaged through my pockets to get some change out, a 50p coin drops out and falls on the floor. Almost immediately, a young lad behind me pounces on the floor shouting something. For whatever reason, I thought he was going to try and steal it and so instinctively I go to stamp on the coin to stop him, although by the time my foot lands on the coin, the kids hand was already there..

He immediately bursts into tears and turns to me crying 'I only wanted to pick it up for you'.

Everyone around just stopped and stared at me. The sobbing kid stands up and holds out the 50p to me. I take it and just stand in silence. 

Fucking horrible moment.

tifu,"So just recently got into reddit after making an account a while back and thought this story, which I still have a hard time believing actually happened, would fit in well I here.  This happened a few years back so not technically today.

My family was going on spring break and we have 2 pets, a dog and a cat. My dog we just send to my grandparents' house because they love her, she loves them, a win win. The cat usually we just leave out if we are just gone for a few days because she is an outside cat and just give her a big bowl of food. She only has 3 legs- dog encounter - and is pretty fat but still manages to kill birds and shit some how. Anyway she was our neighbors cat before they moved and she everyone in our neighborhood knew her because she was the friendliest cat ever. She actually wanted to be by people. She would walk out to people walking by and roll over and get them to pet her. She has wandered off before, like a mile ish away, but everyone knows her so they just call us and we come get her.

Anyhow one of our neighbors adored her. She, whom we now call the crazy cat lady, always asked us about her and even offered to take her when our neighbors moved but we were closer with them and the cat came across the street so much we had a food bowl for her and a bed so we got her. We we offered to let her watch the cat while we left on vacation. She accepted the offer and we brought her over and left.

Fast forward a little over a week and we come home. We drive down to get our cat back and when we knock she look very sad. She tells us she got out the night before and never came back. She said she called and called and left out food, which was now gone. We were heartbroken. The next day after checking in again we kind of came to the conclusion that she probably got taken out my a coyote or something in the woods. But we wanted proof so we did a body search. We canvassed a square mile around her house and look everywhere. We told every neighbor, who all knew her, and took our dog which knew her smell and always got excited when she smelled her because they loved to play together. We looked for days and never found anything; bones, hair, nothing. We were all extremely sad but we decided the best thing was to move on from it and just check back in with her to see if she comes back. We check in every day for about 2 weeks and than just once in a while.

Now while this was all happening we had some suspension because she had probably 3 or 4 dogs and at least that many cats and lived alone. We knew she like our cat and thought maybe she took it or something. But how could we prove it? It's not like we could just go in her house. Now over 4 months had past and it is around the 4th of July and we had some friends up. We were board and they knew about our cat and we decide to go check in for the hell of it. So 4 of us mount up on our bikes and drive down. When we get there and knock and hear nothing and my brother goes and look through the window. Meanwhile I am up on her deck knocking. My brother yells “I see her!, I see Chaser!” I, the serious older brother, tell him to shut up and quit the bullshit. But he continues and we all head over and look and I’ll be damned there she is, looking back at us. While we are looking at her our neighbor walks in and looks shocked. Instant terror of her face as she runs to the door. WE and run over and she than claims to us, “Oh she just came in last night” and “I was just going to call you” None of us say it but it is clearly a lie. The odds of that are nearly impossible. She tries to tell us to come back later with our parents to get her with a cat carrier but I pull out this shitty flip phone my parents gave me told her, “Hey I can call them right now”. She protests but i was already dialing. My dad picks up and doesn't believe me but after much convincing my mom drives down. She is shocked when she gets there and quickly gets all of us in her car and takes the cat away. She kindly thanks the woman for finding her and speeds out of the driveway. When we get home we are all in rejoice. Our cat, who is very vocal and demanding with meowing, attempts a meow when she gets home but its all raspy and barely makes a noise. She hadn't lost much weight and looked visibly shaken. What we are guessing happened if she locked her in her basement and attempted to steal it away from us. The cat hates being inside for too long and probably protested by meowing, which she loves to do. She was probably meowing to get out for the previous 4 months while we thought she was dead. From her body appearance and the fact with her voice and she wasn't dead we could only conclude she was held against her will for the past 4 months. But we looked past it and were just happy to have our ""Tripod"" back. And now to us and the rest of our friends and neighbors she is known as the Crazy Cat Lady.

tifu,"A real TIFU as it happened earlier this afternoon. So I had just gotten in the exam hall, everything was going well, I’d found my seat, which happened to be right in the front row, just my luck, I’d started the paper and I actually understood most of the questions. The problem occurred when I thought I had to yawn near the end of the exam (approximately 15 minutes to go).

I thought nothing of it since I hadn’t slept in a while and I’d already had an exam that day so I was already shattered. I opened my mouth to yawn and nothing happened, any normal person probably would’ve just assumed it was nothing and carried on but I was certain that I HAD to yawn so I tried. 

I tried a bit too hard and ended up omitting this low, loud yell in the middle of this silent hall full of teenagers. Needless to say, I was absolutely mortified as I saw hundreds of faces just turn to face me in unison. I just buried my head in my arms and lay there for the remainder of the exam, wanting for the floor to swallow me whole.

After the exam had finished, one of the adjudicators called me over and asked if I was okay. He then said my entire exam would probably have to be put under review because they have reason to suspect me of cheating because of my scream.

So yeah, a lot of fun...

tifu,"OK, so this happened earlier today. My wife and I had our weekly shop at our local supermarket. As we finished our shopping and walked out of the store we spotted our elderly neighbour standing at the bus stop with about 5 carrier bags full of shopping. We didn't know her very well and have only spoken to her maybe once.

 Both my wife and I decided to offer her a ride in our car. This would spare her a bus ride carrying all those bags. (She is about 85 years old) We walked over to say hi. She looked a bit confused but we introduced ourselves as her neighbours and thought that maybe she would like to have a lift with us and save her from taking the bus. She told us that she'd already bought the bus ticket but as we offered, would we mind taking her shopping with us and leaving it at her back door. That sounded like a plan and we  happily agreed. 

We arrived home only to find our neighbour pruning some roses outside and dressed differently. We both realise that something was seriously wrong as there's no way the bus could have beaten us to her house. We also come to the terrifying realisation that, although looking very similar, the lady we took the shopping from was not our neighbour. We drove back to the store but of course the lady was long gone...waiting patiently for us to bring her shopping home we assumed. We had no idea who she was or where she lived. 

One big fuck up! We went into the store and lied to the manager saying that an old lady left her shopping at the bus stop by accident and if we could leave it with him just in case she returned.

TL;DR:  So yes Reddit, today I fucked up big time. Thought old lady was my neighbour, stole her shopping and am currently on a guilt trip.",TIFU: Mistaking a strange old lady for my neighbor and stealing her shopping.
tifu,"This didn't happen today. It went down last week at ~11 at night. 

I had just come off of a really sudden breakup with my GF the week prior, but I told my friend I was over it. We were texting each other back and forth, we were talking about her ex and such and also how we were going to be roommates pretty soon (we signed a lease along with one other person, we're moving in July; we also work together).

As we're talking, I check my all social media and have a mental relapse: my recent ex had just unblocked me on everything. This, for some reason, broke me. Turns out i guess I'm not completely over her. I wanted to tell my best friend about it, but I stupidly second-guessed myself thinking she might be mad that I went back on what I said before. I ended up really emotionally fucked; a couple friends had also cut contact pretty recently and i was still choked-up about that.

So I take a breather, she and I keep talking, but eventually my angst gets to be too much and I send her a message. ""Hey, can I be completely honest with you?"" She says of course and I start to panic with second thoughts. In my blind, emotionally driven freak-out, I decide that I'll tell her I had feelings for her and that i felt guilty about them.

...I hate that I did that more than anyone could know.

The second i said that I regret it, but she was surprisingly comforting about it, saying i didnt have anything to feel guilty about. I really didn't feel good about it and wanted to correct it, but she seemed so okay with it I figured I'd be doing more damage by taking it back, so I left it at that.

A couple days pass, she hasn't spoken to me since. I send her a message asking what's up, turns out she's furious with me, saying i took away the last person she could trust. She's had a lot of trouble with abuse and her partners cheating in the past, so I understood and tried to explain in a vain attempt to help, but she wouldnt hear it. I got really emotional and ended up making myself out to be the victim, and that only made her more upset.

It's been a week, she won't respond to my messages and she barely talks to me at work. I really just wish I could take it all back and explain what the fuck was going on in my brain, but it's looking a bit late for that.

Probably NSFL - when I tell this story it hurts the vaginas of my friends who do not have vaginas.



K


A couple years ago I decided to see what the fuss about Diva Cups was about, since everyone and their mother was raving about how they'll never use tampons/pads again and it changed their whole period experience etc.

I was a 20ish year old virgin-for-the-context-of-this-post (am a lesbian and had never had anything other than a tampon inside me), but didn't really think it mattered - after all, I know basic women's anatomy, vaginas can definitely handle a tiny squishy object. 

(Okay, well, most can.)

Context for the next part - you insert it by [folding like this](https://www.silkycup.com/Content/Images/uploaded/Silky%20Cup%20reusable%20menstrual%20cup%20India%20C-fold%20or%20U-fold%20or%20Heart%20fold%20500%20x%20500%20IMG_0061.jpg), putting it in, then releasing it to let it open and form a vaccuum.

So. I follow the instructions, I fold the shit up, I try to put it in. Fucking *ow.* That shit hurted. But this is the miracle of periods! So I keep trying for a few minutes and finally manage to get it, folded, most of the way in - and then I release it. Bloody intense pain. Literally.

Though - everybody has trouble their first time, right? That's what everything said online, and it didn't continue actively hurting so I carry on with my evening. Next morning I try to take it out. Uhh. It has a [stem at the bottom](https://media.allure.com/photos/5b06e360573bfc51429d5052/3:4/w_942,h_1256,c_limit/menstrual-cup.jpg) you're supposed to use to just pull it out - but I can't get a grip on it up inside my cooter and I have no fucking idea how the everliving god damn FUCK anyone does. [Here's an artist's depiction](https://i.imgur.com/9Ydq3idr.jpg) of how that shit felt trying to reach up in there. 

So the stem is useless because I can't fit 2 fingers in me. I try to use 1 finger to break the vaccuum and I get nothin. At this point I'm standing hunched over in the bathtub like I'm Quasifuckingmodo with one finger desperately digging in my pocketbook. 

After WAY too long, I table it for the time being. This HURTS and I got shit to do.  I figured I'd just, I don't know, let my body get rid of it? It's supposed to do that, right? So I say fuck it... and then I forget about that mf cuz my period ended that day.



*2 weeks later* I feel the end of the stem while in the shower and I'm like fuuuuuuuck how I forget a whole ass cup in my pussy? Obviously now I gotta get it out, this gettin serious, I don't wanna end up in the ER getting hoohoo surgery

So I do some maneuvering, pro gamer moves you know, and manage to finally grip the stem enough to pull - and as it turns out, I have a microperforate hymen. 

That means my hymen only has a tiny, tiny hole in it, and repairs itself when torn. 

THAT means I tore my hymen (and stretched some other parts beyond their capacity) pulling this thing out - excruciatingly, because it wasn't all at once - it slid out slowly, tearing more and more as it went

I straight up passed out from the pain! That's never happened before! I have such a high pain tolerance! 

Came to in my bathtub with blood splattered across the wall and tub, running down my leg, all over my hands. Soooo much pain. So much. 

Went to the gynecologist a few weeks later and learned the name/details of my hymen issue. Will never ever ever even glance at a Diva Cup ever again ever. 


**TLDR** - Didn't know I have a microperforate hymen, forced a Diva Cup inside me and couldn't get it back out until I ripped up my poor coozie weeks later, passed out from pain and came to to a crime scene.

A few days ago I got a waterproof pouch for my phone. Mostly to listen to music in the shower. Today though I decided I was just going to scroll through Instagram. It’s actually surprisingly hard to use your phone in the shower because there’s water all over your screen so you can’t see shit. Keeping that in mind, I was texting one of my friends and accidentally video called him while in the shower and didn’t notice until he had already picked up and seen me naked.

tifu,"*alt account because some people know my other acc and I definitely don't want them to know this* 

I (19F) decided to borrow my sister's (17F) jacket because it was cold and raining and we were both in a rush to get to school. She had an alternative jacket to go along with her outfit and my usual jacket needed to be washed.  My sister is basically the same height and frame as me so we usually borrow each other's clothes if needed. 

Quickly, I put it on and rushed out the door to get to the car since we were both running a bit late. I didn't really pay attention to the condition of her clothes because first, I was in a rush and second, it was her light winter coat and it's been a while since she's used her Helly Hansen so I assumed it was kept in the closet undisturbed. 

I made it to my class without missing anything too important and sat down next to my classmate as the prof continued her lesson. Throughout the lecture I started to get tired and  my sister's coat was really warm (my classroom is in the cold basement and it was early in the morning). Looking at the jacket's sleeves I noticed some white faded patches so I quickly wiped it away with my hand to see if it would disappear. 

But it didn't. 

I started looking around the sleeves more and realized there's more of these white faded spurts stains. Then I looked down near the stomach area and **there was a fucking huge cum stain roughly covering a quarter of the right side of the jacket.**  there was a huge faded spurt and even some faded evidence of the bodily fluid dripping. 

my mind was just like *why the fuck did you not clean this?* 

I basically went the whole morning and even walked into my class with this big ass cum stain on this jacket.  I don't think my sister has a dick, but I knew that she has a boyfriend.  Whatever sexual activity they had I just wish she had cleaned up the mess, but clearly they were fine with it just happily drying there. 

I look over to my classmate to see if he noticed, but he just kept staring at the lesson so either he didn't notice or he did notice and didn't mention anything (because I mean, you can recognize what cum stains look like, right?) 

I wish I didn't have to know about my sister's sexual activities this way, iT'S toO pERSOnAL anD yEEUK I was basically wearing her boyfriends cum or some shit gAH. 

Washing off all those white spots in the school bathroom was not a fun experience, because I discovered there were stains on the *inside of the jacket too.* I spent at least 20 minutes in there because there were so many stains. If only the rain had washed it, but it was a pretty light rain shower :'(

Now I'm debating whether I should let my sister know, or should I just let it slide and never mention it. If I do tell her, I don't know how awkward it'll turn out. 

Lesson I learned: remember to check the clothes you're borrowing just in case you don't want to be in close contact of someone else's bodily fluids. 

Also, if you don't want your cum stains to be discovered, please clean them. I haven't gotten to know my sister's boyfriend that well, but now I will just have the thought of how I had to clean his cum stain off my sister's jacket every time I meet him. 

TL;DR I unpleasantly discovered my sister's sexual activity because I wore my sister's jacket that had a bunch of cum stains on it (including a huge stain covering a quarter of the right side of the jacket).

tifu,"I’m one of those practical people so at home, especially in the morning, I will sit on the toilet to pee. It’s easier, cleaner, and more quiet (I don’t know why more men don’t do it). Anyway, my penis was about 3/4 hard coming down from morning wood as I sat down. Unfortunately, this was one of those lengthy pisses from not going all night. Went on for about a minute haha and apparently raised the tide in the bowl. So towards the end I have this strange feeling of wetness on my tip and about two seconds later I realize what’s happening and jump up. I process what just happened (very good wake up mechanism, btw) and then decide that I need to shower immediately haha.

tifu,"Obligatory this happened last year.

I have really meta dreams sometimes, like sitting at one exact spot and seeing an image, I do that later in the day and I get weird deja vu. 

I generally set up around 5 alarms to wake me up, in exponentially decreasing intervals so I get pissed off and wake up at the last alarm, or get worried I didn't set it correctly and stay up for the one minute interval until it goes off and I take a sigh of relief (really stupid, I know). I had a test in Chemistry the following day so I set up only one alarm, because stress would do the rest in regards to my awakening, did some revision before bed and fell asleep.

I slept, and had a dream of that alarm going off, me turning it off and going back to bed, then I woke up irl and the same alarm went off and I had this sleep-drunken thought that I could infinitely repeat this until I decided to get up, because it seemed to work once. I tried it, and ended up waking up at 10:30AM and scrambling to my feet, anxious and worried because I missed a test. Luckily, I was able to do it on the following day so it was all good.

tifu,"This happened about an hour prior to me typing this right now (on mobile so sorry about formatting issues). My dad and I are on our way to a driving school I attend for 1 hour lessons. I’m driving our old 2003 Saturn and the ‘check battery’ light has been on all day, but I figured we could make it. The car dies at an intersection about 1/4 of a mile away, so I figured I could run (keyword = run) to the school while my dad stays with the car and calls a mechanic. All is good afterwards and we’re on the way home when my dad tells me the police officer that showed up got on his case because he saw a young boy running away from the car. An even larger mistake was when my dad was asked to give him my birth date and was not only off by a year, but said “I believe it’s that” afterwards. So the officer ran a background check and everything’s fine now, but that’s just a little something that happened today.

tifu,"TL;DR: I asked new potential customer, an elderly man, when he is going to die.

This is mild in the realm of this sub, but it still highlights me as a dumb ass.

Today, I was speaking to new customers and discussing the possibility of signing up for my services. They are a retired couple in their late 60s to early 70s. During our chat I asked if either of them were former military or first responders (to qualify for a discount). As luck would have it, he was a retired Deputy Sheriff in town. Excellent.

The customers and I talk a bit more and they decide to sign up. I got to the part of the application where I needed to run a credit check. Normally I would need the social security number and date of birth. In my caffeine starved mind something went haywire and the words that spilled out my face were not quite right. I asked the customer for his social security number and expiration date.

The worst part is that I didn't realize I said what I said until he bellows in laughter. He looked me in the eye and asked, ""Well how the hell am I supposed to know that?!"" I just asked an older man when he was going to die. I wanted to crawl under my desk.

I recently purchased this business in January and am a woman. The business has been around for 40 years and I bought from the original owners (one is a current county commissioner who knows the customer). I feel like I have a lot to prove to my customers and myself that I can do this. I love joking with the customers, but never to the point of me looking like a dumb ass.

As it turns out I am sure I endeared myself to the customers and all is well. But, TIFU.",TIFU when I asked a customer when he is going to die.
tifu,"Some background to begin with: my fiancee and I have been best friends for 4 years, have been dating for 2, and been engaged for almost a year. She proposed to me in Baskin Robin's after I'd gotten into a very minor car accident a few hours prior. I was given a wedding band and immediately I asked what kind of ring she'd like. She told me that she was a size 8 and all she really wanted was a pretty Walmart ring. She was dead serious. So I picked one out for her and she loved it. The only problem was that it started to turn green pretty quickly. So I was gonna get her a very nice one for her birthday as a surprise.


TLDR: She's only had fake rings and I wanted to get her a real one. 


So I went to Belk to get her a nice sterling silver ring, and I picked one out that was size 8. Because it made sense to me that I should get the same size as Walmart rings. I bought it, and held onto it (and the receipt) for a few months until the big night. Last night we stayed up until midnight and I gave her the ring as soon as the clock changed. I showed her the box and she had the biggest grin on her face. Then she opened it. She said it was beautiful and then educated me on the fact that ring sizes aren't consistent depending on the type you buy. Why size 8 doesn't equal size 8, I will never know. We took it out of the box attempting to see if it fit anyway. No luck. So now we will be going to Belk in hopes that we can exchange it for a bigger size.

TLDR 2 (Escape 2 Africa): I bought her Walmart ring size for a real ring and it was too small.",TIFU by buying the wrong ring size for my fiancee's birthday
tifu,"Obligatory: this happened about 2 weeks ago.

So there I was, swiping my life away, pining for a less lonely tomorrow, when I matched with a real cutie. I had swiped on her because she had an interest in cosplay and other nerdy things like myself. I drop her a smooth one liner based on one of her costumes, and she thought it was funny enough to reply! We ended up talking for a day, having some sincerely good conversations. Day 2, a question came up, I forget who asked. ""What was your worst conversation on Tinder?"" She told me about a guy who tried to sell her some magic mushrooms. I replied with a series of quotes I've gotten in the past before I was really picky about who I swiped on. It was the usual ""Hey Venmo me some money, click this link for pictures of me, wanna see my webcam?"" Type shit. I explained the context.  
No reply for two hours after steady convo. Odd, but maybe she was busy. I closed the app and reopened it about 3 hours after the last message, and to my dismay, a most unexpected message appeared on the app. ""You have been banned from Tinder for violating our terms of service.""  
""Fucking WHAT?"" I was gobsmacked for all of about 30 seconds before it hit me. Their automated systems probably picked up on my last message. It was OBVIOUSLY INTENDED AS A QUOTE complete with quotation marks and preceded by the question which prompted it, so I know not a single REAL person made the call on whether or not I was actually breaking rules. 3 months of using the app, not a single report against me I'd gather, and then this.  
I went into full damage control mode. Just before we had begun discussing this particular topic, we had scheduled a date! How was I supposed to let her know I hadn't just ghosted her? It felt so cruel. I contacted customer service, who took a WHOLE TWO DAYS to send me an automated message that they don't do ban appeals for any reason. Fuckers.  
  
 
Luckily in the mean time, she had done some sleuthing and found me on Facebook because she thought it was really odd that I just dropped off the face of her Tinder inbox. I'll admit I had done the same thing, but I couldn't find her by first name at all. We were both planning to meet at the agreed time and place anyway, where it would have played out kinda like a modern Hallmark movie. Another day of talking and suddenly she wasn't interested in the date. I didn't say anything wrong according to her, she just felt we didn't have enough in common. Oh well.  
  
I would have been okay with the Tinder ban had we worked out. Now I'm just done with dating apps for a while.
  
TL;DR: Quoted a bot on tinder to a girl I was planning to go out with. Got banned. She found me on FB but we didn't work out anyways. Still banned from Tinder",TIFU by quoting a bot on Tinder
tifu,"On mobile so go easy on me :)

So my day started off like any other.  I was laying in my bed, watching YouTube when I got a text from a random number.  Now normally I would just ignore it or block the number, but I was especially bored and malicious today.  (This is where my TIFU starts).

Like any self respecting teen, I respond to their message with a ""did you do it"" followed up by a ""from now on you don't know me"".  Credit to a similar TIFU post for the idea lol. 

Oddly enough, the mystery number replied almost immediately saying ""no matter what you do I'll still love you"".  My idiotic brain as not made the connection at this point, so I respond with, ""how can you after what I've done?"".

I go back to watching YouTube, but I can't get my mind off that weird response.  I think about it for a few minutes then something clicks.  I feel like I knew that number... I text my mom if she recognized the number, and sure enough she does.  It's my Aunt.

So here I am now.  My aunt is one of the sweetest people, and I just messaged her about a ""murder"".  I have a pretty akward call in my future and a lot of explaining to do... Fuck

tifu,"Obligatory did not happen today, but yesterday. I was working and being trained on how to make my job more efficient, along with a few others. A supervisor is grilling me on how to mot waste time and be an efficient cog in the wheel. Afterwards, he let's me know he didnt mean to come off as a dick. I jokingly say it's fine, I didnt mean to either, but it's an autism thing.


Little background- my fiance worked with autistic children and told me I have some traits in common. Like, continuous loud noises make me irritable, if I have a plan for a thing and said thing doesnt happen, I get bad anxiety. Things like that. Nothing major, nothing stopping me from doing my job. Just quirky things.


Anyway, supervisor tells me I should have filled out on my application that I have a disability. I tell him it's not, and we go our separate ways. I continue working, he goes to train the next guy. A little while later, I get a call from the boss man. He tells me I'm being sent home for the day because I completed one of my job tickets wrong (on a system I'm currently being trained on) and they cant find it (supervisor was there when I filled out the ticket and said all was good). I look for 5 minutes, find it, call him back, all is restored. But I'm still being sent home because ""this shouldnt happen"".


So how today, I was told to stay home from the boss, and wait until he comes by to ""talk about yesterday"". So here I am writing this, passing the time, until I either lose my job, or get this fixed. 


TL;DR I told my supervisor I had autism, and my boss might fire me for not filing out paperwork saying I was disabled.


Also, I work for an underground utility locating company and I've been there for about 2 months. In Wisconsin.



Update: I am now no longer employed. Wasnt really given a reason, and since it hasn't been 90 days, they dont have to. Still sucks, but the law is the law, even if its dumb.


Update 2: I dont have autism, it's a self diagnosis, but also makes sense. Autism is such a wide spectrum, almost everyone has symptoms. It just makes sense since if I'm at a family gathering, I'll be very outgoing, then slowly transition to being on my phone and ignore everyone. My fiance says that is a symptom and my phone is a ""security blanket"".",TIFU by telling my boss I have autism
tifu,"Let me set the stage. My entire family is traveling to Hawaii as a memorial service for my father. A long day of travel on Wednesday is followed by a night of blissful rest. The next morning my 2 yo son wakes up, sees the beach, and makes a break for it in utter joy. I quickly grab some sunscreen and put it in my arms and neck, reassuring myself that I would just keep my shirt on. 


Yes, I ended up taking off my shirt. I thought to myself, ""Self, it will only be for an hour or so. You'll be fine."" I play in the water, loving life and the beauty of Oahu, and all the while the evil is creeping into my skin.


Later that day I drive down to Honolulu to pick up my twin brother. He sees that my legs are red, and asks to see my back. I lift up my shirt and show him. He shakes his head, and proceeds to remind my of his terrible experience from a year ago. I had a vague recollection, but I assumed he was just overreacting. But the pity in his eyes when he looked at my burn made me reconsider my previous nonchalant-ness.


But, the day goes on. My sunburn is itching like normal and I think all will be okay. So I go back out to do some surfing. My twin and I are paddling out. The surf is breaking pretty far out so we had a bit of a paddle. About half way through I realize that my burn is starting to itch more and more. I mention it to by brother. His response: ""It's starting"". I still didn't know what I was in for...


The paddle took about half an hour, so I really wanted to stay out there and catch some waves. At this point I will stop referring to it as an itch and refer to it as 'Satan's Tendrils' (ST), because itch does not do it justice. I tell my brother that I needed to go back to shore because it was getting too miserable. So there I was, stranded out pretty far from shore with ST setting in. My brother was nice enough to come in with me. I start paddling like a mad man. I try swimming along with the board so that my back is in the water. I think it provides some relief, but then I realize it doesn't. I go back and forth, searching for some relief in the Paradise that has become my Hell. I start running on the coral, cutting up my feet to try and get to shore and get out of the sun. I get to shore, and some of my family are there. I apply aloe and it does nothing for me. My sister gives me some extra strength Tylenol. I am acting slightly manic, just barely holding it together. I still have an hour drive home, but the air conditioning and Tylenol start to help. I get home and am under control. 


I took a cold shower, which is a big no-no of Hell's Itch. The shower made it way worse. 


At this point I call teledoc. I damned my pride and decided that I would never talk to the doctor again anyway, and at this point was desperate. The doctor was nice enough, and suggested Benadryl and Tylenol. I start to get on a rotation of Benadryl, Tylenol, Ibuprofen, and Zyrtec. As a general rule I don't take a lot of medicine, but I was desperate. 


I go to bed, but the house does not have air conditioning and the humidity and mugginess set ST off again. At this point everyone has gone to bed, and I am running around our air bnb using walls and anything I can find to scratch my back. I am literally running around the house like in a manic state. My mom is sleeping on the couch and wakes up, trying to calm me down. I make it out to the car, blast the air conditioning. My wonderful sister comes out and sits by me, bringing me more blissful medicine. I am in the car from about 10:30 pm to 3:00 am, with maybe 30 minutes of sleep. At 3, I go back into bed and get a few hours of sleep. This was all last night.


Today has been okay, and ST are down to a pretty normal irritation. My twin and fellow Hell's Itch survivor showed me this sub, and it has literally been as much help as anything, so thanks! I figured I would add my experience.

I do my thing and once I feel like it’s time to finish up my business and splatter all over into the toilet, cleaned it up a tad with some toilet paper just threw it all on top and closed the lid.  I then sat down turned the shower on put my music on and just forgot about my seminal fluids that I left inside of the toilet.  I hop in the shower clean up and after just once again sit down on the toilet with my towel wrapped around me.  A couple minutes after I’m done with my shower i get a knock on the bathroom door and it’s my sisters bf(16) who wants to use the restroom.   I told him sure Just give me like 1 minute to put my clothes on and get out of there.  Well I completely forgot about my stuff I didn’t flush and I get up and head to my room.  He goes in and comes out very quickly and heads back to the game room where him and my sister were watching a movie. So I go back into the bathroom because I forgot my phone in there too and sure enough the lid was wide open and to my view I see the stuff all inside the toilet with some toilet paper floating around.  I immediately close the door flush the toilet and hear him say that he wants to go home to my sister....  idk what to say or do I’m kinda just frozen that my sisters bf saw my stuff all inside the toilet.

Back then I was always way too enthusiastic and reckless about everything, because it was my ONE place to release all stress and just be with friends you know?

So one day we were working on a new play and we needed someone to do some acrobatic stuff AND I WAS IN FOR IT. 

I tried to do a splits. (Never done it before, never did it again) While my one leg was going backwards, the other one went in front of me. My hand was on my knee, and while I'm doing this I feel my kneecap dislocating and this weird gap underneath my hand where it should be. Worst pain I've ever experienced. I pushed it back right after it happened but I still needed surgery because almost all of my cartilage was gone :(

Worst part was trying to go to the doctor because the pain was horrible and them telling me I needed to cool it and wait 2 hours to see if it got better... It didn't and even after surgery it still dislocates spontaneously every now and then.

However, I don't pull my chair out far enough, and I whack the hell out of my knee on a corner of the desk. There I am the next few minutes, barely breathing because I'm in so much pain. Being young at the time, I thought ""I can tough it out."" Also, I didn't want to add to the embarrassment of such a stupid accident. The next few weeks, I'm limping around until I heal up enough to walk normally again. For the eagle eyed among you, yes, I did say ""the next few weeks."" ""Why didn't you go to the doctor when it wasn't getting better? Did you not have insurance?"" I did actually have insurance, and it was good. Also, it would have been a workman's comp situation, so there's that. I was a young, stubborn, proud dumbass.

Fast forward a few years to last month. I'm experiencing pain in that knee to the point that I was having trouble putting weight on it. Again. I get an X-ray, and the first thing the radiologist asks is ""Did you injure your knee?"" That X-ray lit up like a Christmas tree, so they had to refocus and zap it again at lower intensity or something so there would be actual signal instead of just visual noise. Turns out I've been walking on a broken knee for years, and now I have arthritis. To make that even more fun, today had torrential rain, so that arthritis flared up.

On our way to school this morning we're chatting about what he's learning in school, all subjects, and then get around to sex ed in science. We laugh and chat about the awkwardness of it (you know, big peen and balls followed by a giant vulva displayed on the projector, type stuff), I ask if he has questions about anything that's been discussed so far, etc. Then comes up the bit about using protection to prevent pregnancy and transferring of STIs...and to lighten the mood, because if you haven't gone through sex ed as a teen or had sex ed convos with your kids, that shit is awkward and in our house we defer to comedy to help ease awkward tension...anyways, so I reference this [bit](https://youtu.be/6g_MFjfHSt4) by Chad Daniels saying that pregnancies are like STDs... you know bc you get sick, tits are sore, then you pop out a creature that sucks up all of your time, money, and energy ( I did not go into that detail with my stepson though)...to this my stepson replies ""My Grandma told me I was a surprise""...FUCK ME...G-Ma hadn't told me or my spouse that she shared this bit of info with him, so this was news to me that he knew he wasn't planned and now hearing this joke that I referenced insinuating that unplanned pregnancies are like STDs. My point was to lighten the mood and also instill in him that pregnancy should be planned, never to suggest that HE is like and STD.

That was my fuck up...here's my follow up... I did not backtrack or lie to him and tell him that ALL pregnancies and children are beautiful blessings...why? Because I am raising what I hope to be a respectable, healthy, and *happy* individual whom I want to be able to be active in making his life altering decisions and be fully educated on them. I did explain that I meant that it is preferred to plan these kinds of things out so that you are ready for that kind of life change and not forced into it at an inopportune or unplanned time in your life, and that pregnancy itself can be an unpleasant thing for some people to experience.  He agreed and then carried onto conversations about not everyone has to have kids, because it's not for everyone and that everyone has the right to be happy and should be able to choose...so I think he's ok, but I feel like an ass and hope that he is ok and doesn't feel like he is an STD, because he is not, he's a cool little dude. I do plan on feeling out the situation after school, just to be sure he is good with everything.

I'm from Denmark and I play softball. There aren't many people who play softball here, but we are enough to have about a dozen teams. I usually play 3rd base, but my coaches thought it would be fun to have everyone play on positions they don't play very often. I was picked to be our catcher. I'm not good at being the catcher, I know the basics, but if you have the ability to pick another play to do it, pick them because I will probably make us lose.

So, my team was doing fine, the other team was in the lead with 2 points, so we were doing better than most of us expected.

There was a runner on 3rd base and when the batter hit the ball, the runner on 3rd base ran like the fucking wind, without even seeing where the ball was going. The shortstop got the ball and threw it to me so we could out him. I tagged him and I was planning to throw the ball to 1st base to out the batter. I noticed how close he was to being save so I thought I should just throw the ball to the pitcher.

For some reason, I went for it and threw the ball to 1st base, but somehow, I managed to fuck up, and I threw the ball so poorly, the ball hit the runner on the head. and he fell over, landing on the side of his face on the  gravel.

Oh yeah, did I mention we didn't play with helmets on?

somehow, our coaches forgot to bring helmets, and when they realized they forgot them, they just thought to themselves ""meh, it's fine. we'll play the match anyway"". 

So the boy was just laying there, crying hysterically and everyone from our team was just like ""uhh, what do we do know"". after like 5 seconds some of the parents came running out, picked him up, took him to get his stuff and then him and his mom ran out to the parking lot and then they drove off.  When he was picked up by the parents I noticed he was bleeding from the left side of his face. It wasn't an ocean of blood or anything, but it was enough for me to think ""this kid is going to the hospital right fucking now"".

Our coaches said we couldn't continue the match, because the other team didn't have enough players anymore, so we ended it, I grabbed my stuff and then I drove home on my bike.

I don't know what happened to the kid or if he's ok or if he went to the hospital. All I know is that it was my fault and I feel really shitty right now.

I (19M) got on a tram omw home with one of my friends, but he leaves 1 stop before me. So once he leaves, I decide to listen to some songs from my phone through my wired apple earpods. The thing is, I have to get off after 1 stop which takes around 2 minutes. During this 1 stop, the tram goes through a tunnel.  I put my phone in my pocket whilst listening to a song, but I couldn't hear anything. I assumed, that it had to be a connection issue since I was going through a tunnel. Just to make sure, I maxed the volume and I even started pausing and playing the song using the buttons on the earpod. 

Around 1:30 minutes later, I stand up by the door ready to get off. There were many people taking the tram at the time which was normal, apart from the fact that everyone was staring at me at the same time. The pregnant lady right infront of me started chuckling. She then looks at this lady of around 20 and laugh together and they seemed like they didn't know eachother. They look back at me where I didn't know what to do, but to smile. There were some other people in the background looking at me with a dead face too, so I decided to avoid eye contact by looking outside.

After I leave at my stop, I start wondering why my music is still not playing. I left the tunnel ages ago! As I am walking into a less crowded area, I start hearing music except it wasn't through my earbuds. I then take my phone out of my pocket and realized that the earbud wire wasn't fully connected to my fucking phone.

So I jumped in after my friend with the intention off swimming out to where she was. Then I made the insanely clever decision to swim with my eyes open under water so I could see if there were any jellyfish around. As you might imagine I noticed the jellyfish a bit to late and ended up getting stung all over my face including in one of my eyes.
For those of you who have never been stung by a jellyfish fish in the eye let me tell you that it hurts a lot and all I wanted to do was just to keep my eyes closed and curl up into a ball. However that was not really an option as I had to get to my mom to catch a ride home. So I walked with my eyes closed as much as possible trying not to crash into anything or one all the way through town.
When we got home we called my grandfather who's a doctor, which was what really made me feel stupid because he had never had any patients who had been stung in the eye before.

My brother moved out a while ago to go live with his girlfriend, and quit smoking weed to move over there. I knew for a fact he had empty weed oil cartridges in his desk, so I got one that had some juice in it. I saw a video on YouTube showing me how to use the cartridge without having a batter/atomizer to vape it with. I used an Android charger cut in half to heat it up and then took a hit. I didn't feel anything. I take another one and I cough a lot, but still nothing. I keep taking hits, I don't even know how many I took but it was a lot, and eventually my vision gets blurry and my heart is pounding.

At this point I'm so panicked, I call both my mom, brother, and dad but they're at work and can't answer. I knew nothing else to do, so I called 911. I was so panicked, and I basically admitted to what I did and told the operator my name, where I live, how much I had. They send a fuck ton of ambulances and fire trucks and shit. I let them in and with the sheer number of them around makes me panic even more. The measure my heart rate, which was 170 bpm, and my blood pressure which was 180/69. They basically laugh about it and tell me not to mess around with it, which suprised me because I thought I'd get arrested or my brother would. My parents got home and I knew they'd hate me, but they actually were just glad I'm okay and told me that they love me no matter what. They were mostly mad at my brother for having it in the house, and giving me the idea that it's okay and can be messed around with. I don't know why I had such a ridiculous reaction or if that makes me a pussy because I called the cops, but I won't ever mess with that shit again.

tifu,"My cousin and I are working on a software project together, but we live in different parts of the USA so we do everything remotely. He is newer to the software world so when he is having issues that he can't resolve then I'll often remote into his computer using AnyDesk and take over his machine so I can resolve whatever the problem might be (in this case merging branches in Git, but I digress).

We grew up like brothers and have been pulling pranks on each other for as long as I can remember. When I was finished helping him out he said he had to run to the store, so we hung up the phone and off he went. I noticed that he forgot to disconnect me from AnyDesk, so it was time to pull a good one. I had full access to his machine. I wait a few minutes to ensure he is gone so that he comes back to a nice surprise.

I bring up a browser, navigate to YouPorn and then search for ""hardcore gay sex"". I click the first one I see that is over 30 minutes long to ensure it's still playing when he gets back, hit play, put it in full-screen mode, turn the system volume up on his computer all the way, then head into my living room to watch some TV while I await his inevitable text or call.

About 15 minutes later I get a call, but it wasn't my cousin, it was his mother. 

Just for a bit of context, my Aunt is one of the sweetest most innocent people you would ever meet. I could probably count the number of times I've heard her curse on one hand, she's never done drugs, doesn't drink aside from the occasional wine for the holidays, and is prudish. Sweet but prudish. The most hardcore thing she has ever done is smoke cigarettes.

As it turned out my cousin was hanging out at his mother's house. He has been spending a lot of time with her lately because she is growing older and she is having surgery soon, and she also lives alone (Uncle passed away years ago). She had been sleeping.

Apparently the volume was loud enough to wake her up, she's quite a deep sleeper. She went to investigate only to find hardcore gay porn blaring on my cousins laptop. She is not technology-inclined *at all* so she doesn't know what's going on. She had assumed her son was watching it. Apparently he was able to explain the situation when he got back because I answered her call (I thought it was him because she called using his phone):

*""GAY PORN!?""*

At this point I'm stunned. It didn't even occur to me that he might be hanging out with her that evening. I'm not quite sure how to respond but at the same time I'm having to stifle an incredible urge to laugh my ass off as I'm picturing exactly how everything went down in my head.

*""GAY PORN!? IS THIS WHAT YOU LIKE TO WATCH?""*

(she's an older lady with ""traditional"" values so homosexuality makes her uncomfortable, though she does support gay rights)

[Trying my hardest not to laugh] *""I'm so sorry! You know Anthony and I have been pranking each other ever since we were kids. I had no idea he was at your house!""*

*""THAT WAS DISGUSTING! WHY WOULD YOU PUT ON GAY PORN!?""*

After a few minutes of talking her down she puts my cousin on the phone and I explode with laughter, I was literally crying from laughter. I hear her muffled voice in the background fade away as my cousin steps outside. He said in a lighthearted manner ""you fucking asshole! You KNOW I'm going to get you back good for this one"", and I say ""I know"", then he breaks out in laughter.

I tell him that maybe it wasn't too bad, maybe she just saw a couple guys making out. He said ""no, it wasn't just making out, trust me. It was blaring loud hardcore gay sex"", and I double-over with laughter again.

**TL;DR:**

Cousin and I are working on a software project together, I remote into his machine to help out with a problem.

tifu,"Sooo... about three hours ago my brother called me before I got off work. He was watching my sisters dogs while she was out of town- he wanted me to watch them because he needed to be up earlier than me and I was already close because I work nearby. I agreed and thought nothing of it.

I got off work and went to Walmart to get some stuff for an overnight stay. It took me maybe half an hour. From there I got in my car, pulled out of the lot, got ready to get on the highway... BOOM! Hit a guy trying turning into a red light. I slammed my breaks but it’s been raining so I slid a bit and clipped his rear bumper. 

His car was fine. He’s got a tiny Knick in his rear bumper but no structural damage. My car... is totaled. The front right of the car that I fixed just a week ago is caved in completely.

A little background, I'm a Computing Science student in the UK studying for a Bachelor's degree, also currently applying for a Master's degree which starts next year. In Computing Science, your final year work will be a computing project instead of a dissertation, where you have to do some research on a topic and/or create something - a project that will utilise the practical edge of Computing Science. My project included a lot of Java code, and as many students do, I left a lot of the development to the last month/weeks. There were many late nights as a result, and at some point during my rage of how much I underestimated the scope of the project, I inadvertently comment ""// more code here for this f\*\*\*ing \[project\]"", planning to come back and finish this certain part later. For those who don't know - a comment is a piece of text that is ignored when the computer reads the code, so it's helpful for annotation, reminders etc. A few days and weeks go by, and I gracefully start to ignore certain comments while I carry on developing, and totally forget that this comment is there. Keep in mind, this comment is in a piece of work that will give me a large proportion of my degree, and my project supervisor and someone random will be checking through it for readability and how easy it would be to maintain the code. A month has gone by since the deadline, and I have a presentation in a few days about this project. My supervisor will be one of two people I present my work to, and he very much lacks a sense of British humour, so I'm hoping he doesn't take the mistaken comment too badly...

This happened around a year ago 


So a couple days ago it was announced that our band director for the high school is leaving and going to a different school. That same day we needed to hand in all of our music from the year. Me, being a stupid kid, decided it would be nnice if I kept the music, as a way of remembering that band director

About a week or two later, when school was out for some time, I thought everything was well and good. I had the stolen music with the rest of my music (I play piano BTW). Occaisionally I would bring it out and play it just for fun. One day, while my mom and dad were at work, and I was tickling the ivories, the mail came. I went outside to get it, amd since I was a little snoop, I checked what was in there. 

The thing that caught my eye was a letter from my school district's music department. Making sure I was care full, I opened up the letter to take a look. My heart almost stopped. In the envelope was a bill for $115. It was because of the sheet music i still had. I told my parents, and we found out that I couldn't just hand the music in, since it was in bad shape. So my parents payed, and I had to pay all the money back in 6 months.

I woke up late this morning and needed to take my dog out quickly so I could leave for work. We went on the usual route I take him on and turned a corner and there was a girl walking her dog. It was on a wide path so I was just gonna go around because I don’t like to bother people and I was in a hurry. She started walking towards me and asked if my dog was friendly to which I replied “yeah.”

We let our dogs meet and she started talking to me. She was very friendly and was telling me about her dog and I think she told me her own name. I think she also tried to tell me she was single by saying “she (her dog) loves seeing other people and dogs. It’s only ever us alone, so...”  After a minute or something I pulled my dog back a bit and she said “nice to meet you” and we walked away from each other. 

You might have noticed I didn’t include any of my responses to what she was saying. That’s because I never said anything to her aside from the “yeah” at the beginning. I didn’t even say “you too” when she said “nice to meet you.” I think I was just so tired and in a hurry that I didn’t process what was happening so I just stared like an idiot.

Long time browser of Reddit but first time poster! Anyways, I recently started a new job working in IT about 2 months ago. I haven't really gotten to know my coworkers super well, but we always like to watch funny youtube videos and discuss memes at work. Today I showed them a video of a guy freaking out about having to install windows updates. This guy in the video goes ballistic, ends up blaming Obama and calling him the n word at the end. I totally forgot about this part when I showed it to them! They thought it was funny but they both cringed at that part in the video. I was able to save the situation by claiming how this dude's behavior is ridiculous and uncalled for.

tifu,"This fuck-up happened over a year ago, but I didn't piece it all together until last week.  TL;DR at the bottom.

  

So around March of last year, I finally had all the parts of a brand new PC purchased and shipped to my house.  I'm a computer guy and work in IT, but I was still nervous about putting together my first custom PC.  I watched build videos, carefully read the documentation for my motherboard and case, and searched reddit for common PC building pitfalls (offsets! turn the PSU on! no static!).  I was particularly concerned about having good temperatures because I was planning on overclocking my sweet new 7700k CPU.  I was using a Deepcool Captain AIO liquid cooler, which seemed to work well and looked beautiful with the build.

  

Here's where the fuck up began.  I never connected the case fans that are designed to pull the warm air out of the case.  I even saw them sitting there idle after I booted up the computer, but it never occurred to me to use them because I had an AIO cooler with fans and while the PC was running, temperatures were close to normal, if a bit on the high side (40C idle, 65-70C under load).  In addition, the case came with cables pre-managed, and the cables for the case fans were run very discreetly inside the case to the back and bundled with other cables.  I cannot recall hearing any pitfalls about not plugging in case fans nor did I remember reading anything about them in the case or motherboard documentation.  So I went on my merry way playing games on Ultra at 90+FPS (I booted up Far Cry 4 and legit teared up a bit because it looked so beautiful, it was also 2am and I was quite tired from building all evening).  

  

Cue 9 months later.  It's the start of the Path of Exile Betrayal league (basically a new season of the game).  I've finally gotten around to getting a basic Twitch stream set up.  I'm playing with friends, streaming the game, and having a good time.  We were probably four hours in and planning on playing at least another four, when all of the sudden my screen goes black.  I can still hear my friends on Discord, but I have no visuals.  Then the PC starts to make a weird noise that freaks me out, so I immediately power down and begin diagnosing the issue.  I give the inside of the case a cursory glace, don't see anything wrong, so I boot it back up.  Still no visuals.  I move the cable from the GPU to the motherboard and now I've got visuals again.  I power down the PC, open up the case, and to my horror, see a quarter sized pool of liquid on my GPU already beginning to corrode.  I look up and see my AIO cooler ever so slowly leaking drops of coolant on to my ruined GPU.  I was crushed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I began taking pictures of everything and documented as much as possible.  I noticed that a pipe that connected to the pump of the AIO cooler had become slightly dislodged which allowed for coolant to escape.  Now at this point, the astute and observant of you have pieced together what happened.  However, I did not.  I began the lengthy and somewhat frustrating RMA process, but after a few months, the cooler company (to their credit) fully replaced the cooler and GPU at no cost to me.  Yaaaay!  

  

As I was re-installing the replaced parts, I left off the sides of the case so that if I needed to make adjustments or troubleshoot, I wouldn't have to take apart the case again.  Everything was up and running smoothly, but I noticed the temperatures were significantly cooler (30C idle, 50C under load).  ""Wow,"" I thought.  ""The aftermarket thermal paste I bought is really doing a bang up job on cooling.""  Folks, I am super dumb.  It was not the thermal paste.  Once I had deemed everything was operating correctly, I put the case back together.  The temperatures jumped back up to the old numbers.  Then it dawned on me: the hot air is getting trapped inside the case!  I stared at the idle case fans, and they stared back, judging me silently with their unmoving blades.  10 minutes later and after much cursing, I had case fans plugged in and operating, keeping the CPU temps as cool (and even cooler) as they were with the case sides completely off.  I played some games, told my friends how dumb I was, and again went on my merry way.  

  

The next day, I kept thinking about how silly I was for not plugging in the case fans.  For months on end, hot air was trapped inside my PC just because I missed a step and never put 2 and 2 together.  Then I had another realization.  Pictures of the failed AIO where the pipe had separated from the pump flashed through my brain.  The pipe was glued in, and the glue failed.  Oh no.  It was totally my fault.  That night it failed had been a particularly long gaming session + streaming on top of it.  The processor was making a lot of heat, and all that heat had built up inside the PC and, in all likelihood, the glue melted, allowing the pipe to slip out.  The whole thing probably could have been prevented had I just given my computer some fresh air to breathe instead of hotboxing my poor PC components to the point of failure.  So if you've read this far, thank you for sticking with me and please, ventilate and cool your PC properly.

I'm 18 and had met this kid on Instagram, we've been friends for a while and I'm a really shy and anxious person so him being nice to me made me happy, I had another friend (a girl) who was also part of this friendship, I trusted them and they trusted me. 

The whole relationship wasn't like a friendship, more like a family relationship. Recently I started to develop feelings for the dude (I know I shouldn't have but whatever) and told the girl, she felt the same way about him and we just chatted about it, I said I really really liked him and for some reason decided to tell him.

He said he didn't feel the same way (obviously) and I was worried I had upset him, so I asked if I had made him feel uncomfortable, he told me I hadn't and couldn't change how I felt. That made me reassured that I hadn't ruined our friendship.

Today it all changed, well last night specifically. We were in a group chat the 3 of us and he randomly started joking about me sending a voice message (I have bad anxiety so I hadn't done it before, neither had he) and I joked around saying ""I'm ringing the police on you"" and he replied ""You'd be the one getting arrested"" that really hurt me, I thought it was a Joke at first but then I realised he clearly thought I was a paedophile.

I instantly messaged the girl asking what that was about and she spun some lies about not being a problem and apparently he did feel uncomfortable (but didn't tell me) and some other stuff. I was really upset about this all, I never ever wanted to hurt him or make him feel like I'm a paedophile. I instantly messaged him explaining how it was a mistake and that I've never had a relationship before so I must have just gotten mixed up and confused. He didn't reply.

I cried and debated killing myself last night, all because of someone I've never seen, heard or met. I messaged again today and he answered, he basically called me a paedophile and said I'm fucked up and other stuff. I apologised deeply to him and told him that I never meant anything bad by it (which I didn't, I never felt any emotion other than a caring one) but he didn't wanna hear any of it.

He unfollowed me and blocked my follow but then unblocked me so I could see his bio, it says ""Always a victim to paedophilia 😂😂😂😂"" that was like a kick in the balls for me. Im absolutely distraught and can't believe I've ruined my friendship with these 2.

Also she told me that she's still always there for me and stuff, then I deleted my account and checked my backup account and saw her bio, it was the same as his now.

Any comments appreciated, I know what I did was wrong and I'm not denying any of it, I feel like pure shit rn.

tifu,"So, this started a week ago, but today I realized my mistake.

Last weekend I brought the family camping. The site we are at does not have electrical hookups, so everything relies on a 12v deep cycle battery..

The battery we had was not holding a charge-- the generator should have charged it up after a few hours, but it would only work for an hour and a half.

So, I went to a local *mart and picked up a replacement. So far, so good.

I wired the new battery in, and the little circuit breaker that is inline with it starts kicking off.

So I go to the RV store and buy a replacement.  I don't have my tool kit, so  I end up doing a half-assed crimp using my Leatherman.

New CB isn't kicking out, so good news, right?

With the battery installed, nothing would work, and since I didn't have my tool kit, no multiplayer to troubleshoot with.  I left the battery disconnected,  and left the campsite for home because I had to go back to work.  The spouse and kid stayed for the week.

Next day, get a text about how now the fridge wouldn't work. Just wouldn't come on when the generator was running.  Nothing I can do over the phone.

Yesterday, I packed up my tool bag and drove back.

I checked the battery: 12.5 v DC, good. I checked the fuses in the power panel: the 40 fuse labeled ""Battery reverse"" was blown.

So, this morning I went out to the auto store, picked up some new terminals, a little wire, etc. and replacement 40 amp fuses.

I repaired the shitty terminals I made last week, then started troubleshooting the problem.

Took me an hour and a half (and a couple more fuses) to figure out the I just plain wired the battery in backwards.

The trailer is wired like household wiring with black as hot and white as neutral (or ground). I assumed that the white wire was actually a faded yellow (meaning 12+ to me) and therefore black was negative.

*An hour and a half* it took me. I've been working with electrical crap for literally decades, and my dumb ass put a battery in backwards, trying to destroy everything. The original circuit breaker was a 15amp and the new one is rated for 30 amps, which is why I ended up blowing fuses instead of having the breaker click over every fifteen seconds.

When I get home,I am going to label TF out of those terminal wires.

I got out of the car and as my dude plugged the bitch in and started his pump machine, there was a very loud noise, which initially I completely dismissed by saying to myself ""This must be a good pressure pump; it's really getting it in there"", but really of course, it the noise of the gas was being pushed straight through the pipeline into fucking thin air.

It was also the sound of regret and shame and the sadness that I would eventually get when 4 auto-wallas (rickshaw drivers) get out their vehicles to come and laugh at you because all

The guy who was filling the gas told me to open my trunk and I couldn't figure why he would ask me that, until I opened it and was greeted with the gas hitting my face directly.

&amp;#x200B;

I was then told to open all the doors of the car and wait there for about 10 minutes while the whole gas station (with around 40-50 people) was completely halted because a single spark could have blown the whole place up.

Had to pay for the gas that was already pumped inside and onto my face of course but it only costed ₹251 (Around $4).

It's not often a problem, but today I did it and I fucked up. See, the reason I'm annoyed by the habit is because it's not as fully ingrained as the zipper-first-then-button method is, so sometimes, maybe 1 out of 10 times, my synapses misfire and I do up the button and leave the zipper open. Not noticeable in every pair of pants, but very noticeable in a well-fitting pair, which I had on today. 


For reference, I'm a woman, so going for a pee means the pants go all the way down and I sit. Thankfully that habit seems uninterrupted so far.

I left the can, and walked back to my desk, stopping to visit or chat along the way.

As with all horny teenage guys, in high school, sex and all things related was pretty much topic number one in every conversation. One day I was at Josh’s house and I don’t exactly remember what brought it up, but we were talking about jacking off and when/where we do it, all that shit.

So Josh says, “I jack off at this desk right here,” gesturing to a desk, maybe two feet in length, up against one of the walls in his room. Its more of a standard wood table, simple design, nothing fancy, with a simple file cabinet on the right side attached, and no back panel or anything. I ask him, “Well, where do you finish?” It was a valid question. I personally usually always did my business in the bathroom, easy access to toiler paper to finish into. No mess, easy clean up. You’re in, you’re out, and no evidence to link you to the dirty deed. This question was also prompted by the fact that Josh had a bathroom in his own room, so choosing his desk instead of his bathroom seemed an odd choice, especially because I didn’t see any tissues in his room, needless to say on his jack off desk. Was it a sock? Did he go get toilet paper before the act? Valid questions from a curious mind like mine.

Now, its important to note that Josh liked to boast about the power he had. That he could shoot his seed several feet. Of course, as with all things with boys, and teenage boys in particular talking about sexual things, the truth is never really what they say. So this statement was certainly a stretch of the truth, at the very least. But he was a shooter, not an oozer, that’s for sure.

“I shoot my load onto the back of the wall underneath my desk,” he said in a completely normal tone. I couldn’t take him seriously. “You’re fucking with me.” “No,”” he said, almost acting as though his actions were normal.

I couldn’t take him at his word. I go to his desk, bend down and gaze at the wall beneath his desk. There, against the wall, on the title floor near the wall, on the small piece of wood stretching from the bottom of the back left leg of the table to the back end of the file cabinet, laid more dried, crusted baby seed than in a bukkake porn video. Remember now, we’re talking about a teenage boy, a boy who likely jacked off twice a day at the very least. Underneath that desk there had to have been the remnants of hundreds of business sessions, dried up in a pale cream colored dried mess. Quite possibly one of the most grotesque things I have ever laid my eyes on.

I laughed in horror. I couldn’t believe what I’d just seen, what he’d just admitted to and shown his friends. How could someone think this was a logical solution to jacking off? I asked him if he ever planned on cleaning it, or if he was in fear that his parents might find his baby stash. He shrugged, I think up until that point he never really considered that eventual possibility.

Well, whether it was a few months, or a year later, the inevitable happened. His mom was cleaning his room, picking up clothes off the floor when she looked down and found his horrid masterpiece, his crusted jizz sculpture. I never got a straight answer about how his mom reacted to the cum puddle, but it probably something he was ashamed of. His mom ended up cleaning it up, that I do know.

Moral of the story: at the very least, use a sock.

TL;DR: friend jacked off and finished on the floor, his mom eventually discovered the dried prize","TIFU by not using a sock, at the very least [NSFW]"
tifu,"Context:

Mom and dad are out for the night and my sister was at work so I was left on my own for dinner.  So I grabbed a burger, tossed it on the burner, and after a few minutes the smoke started to billow (old burner that hasn't been cleaned in a while) so I decided to open the door and turn on the vent.  

The FU:

Our door is a slider that has the main door and a screen, so when I opened the glass door I forgot to close the screen and let two of the family cats run out without me noticing for a good half hour. Fortunately they're not the adventurous type and they just sat on the porch.

The third, however, is afraid of everything except my sister and will run in sight.  He's also small, black, and I'm typing this at almost 9 pm.

When I realized my mistake I ran to grab the two outside, near slammed the door shut, then started the frantic search for the third running into every hiding place I knew of.  I found nothing, so I called my sister who (left a bit early to help with the search) and my aunt who lives next door.  

About ten minutes go by and my aunt and I are out in the yard looking in every small place we could get a light to shine in.  A few minutes later my sister shows up and starts looking in the spots I didn't know about.  And what do you know, he was stuck in the basement in a small place.  

So yeah, crisis averted ha ha...*sigh*

TLDR: Forgot to close the door and thought my sister's cat escaped into the night never to be seen again.",TIFU by almost letting my sister's cat go free
tifu,"Several years ago, before she passed, I was speaking to my great grandmother on the phone. Every year she would send my siblings and cousins $50 for Christmas. It was tradition for all of us to call her up on Christmas Day and thank her, have a short conversation before saying our goodbyes and passing the phone to another relative. Well in an attempt to make the conversation seem less forced like “hey thanks for the money, bye”, I was trying to figure out how exactly to make small talk with an 80-something year old woman. I started telling her about art school, basic catching-up, and that I would send a family photo some time. My sister, who was standing next to me waiting for her turn to speak, glared at me in shock as she began to mouth the words “she’s blind!”. I nervously tried to cover up my social blunder as my sweet great-grandmother kindly thanked me for the generous offer and I passed the phone along to my sister. 

TL;DR: having rarely spoken to my great-grandma, I told her I would send her a family photo, forgetting she was totally blind.",TIFU by telling a relative I’d send a family photo
tifu,"(I started writing this when the whole situation first happened, but it started to get more and more complex, so I’ve been waiting to get as much info as possible, and it’s been about two months since the first incident.)So here’s some background information, my parents have been together 19 years. My dad’s the real provider for the family, he was in the military for 26 years, but retired after being hurt in a car accident. He still makes good money off his new job and Veteran’s Affairs checks. My mom spends a lot of his money on clothing and purses and other stuff, but it’s kind of okay because she’s a stay at home mom. The one thing I was always upset about her was that she traveled a lot, never taking any of my family with her. Me(16M), and my two little brothers(11) never have traveled anywhere with her. With that out of the way, here’s the story. I was just playing Red Dead Redemption 2, and my mom came down to watch me play because that’s her way of interacting with me. She kept asking questions about the story and stuff, and I’d tell her to listen to the characters and cutscenes but she wouldn’t listen because she was just texting on her phone. Eventually, I was annoyed and said, “Let’s see what’s keeping you busy.” I tried to grab the phone jokingly, but she got scared and pulled away, which got me interested. I left the room and five minutes later, I came back and took her phone right out of her hands while she wasn’t looking, she started screaming and chasing me around. I tried to read but I couldn’t read the texts, but I recognized the name(we’ll call her V, who’s a female). She was upset and left, and I figured something was up because if there was nothing to hide she wouldn’t have acted this way. So I knew something was wrong. I acted distant the next few days because I was worried about what was wrong and that she was hiding stuff from me. A couple days past, and she sat me down before school, and asked me what I saw on her phone. Now since I didn’t know any specifics, I didn’t want her to know that so I just said, “You tell me.”  That’s when she basically said, “You saw what I was talking to V about. How I like-like her.”  And guess what happened the next day. My dad told me he knew that I knew. WHICH MEANS HE KNOWS ABOUT THE AFFAIR!!!! He said  that he doesn’t like it, but he has a couple reasons for tolerating it. 1.He still loves her, 2.He doesn’t want to break the family up, and 3.She says she’s “exploring herself” so he feels like it would be unfair to give her an ultimatum. I was pissed. My dad is sacrificing so much, including his self respect and happiness, and my moms sleeping around with her best friend. 

Now about two months have passed, and my dad is still unhappy, my mom still doing this, and she’s barely at home anymore. She’s at V’s house 24/7 basically.(Another fun side note, V also has a husband and two kids, and her husband also knows and is also very sad and upset with this).

And the worst part is, my mom keeps making me and my dad hang out with V. She’ll make us have dinner with her and her family, and it’s so awkward and painful. I’m just really pissed off that my mom is just tearing apart my family and making us unhappy, just for her sake. 

For those of you that read this far, thank you for listening, and I hope you don’t fuck up like I did.
Moral of the story is don’t read other people’s phones...

TLDR:I read my mom’s phone, stumbled across her affair with her best friend, and my family’s falling apart, yay!

EDIT:To the people(and I say people even though I only saw one guy say this) who are saying I’m an asshole for looking through my moms phone, yeah I fucked up, it’s in the title, but I don’t think it’s all that fair to call me an asshole when looking at this entire situation.

EDIT: Also I’m stupid for not mentioning this earlier, but the affair has lasted longer than I’ve known about it, it started around last August, sorry I feel like that was something I should’ve mentioned",TIFU by stumbling across my mom’s affair...
tifu,"Ok so this literally just happened and I’m not *really* associated but I kinda am


Only backstory you need is to know I’m in high school and not college 


TL;DR. At the bottom 


Ok so we are in drama class and I’m our school we have pods where we can privately work.
So out of the blue my group desires that we are going to order a pizza.
So we order the pizza online and a few minutes later 2 guys in our group o to pick it up (the place was less than a half kilometre away) 
They take maybe 20 minutes witch surprised me because it was so close (I later found out they went to the convenience in the same plaza)  a few minutes later I hear frantic knocking in the door and let them in when they tell me to hide the pizza (extra large with a plastic bag full of Coke’s and chips, plus there was no place to hide it) a second later I hear the keys in the door and my ANGRY drama teacher (who is most of the time really chill) and she rips in to us telling us that she is pissed and she is considering giving us a zero for the project (this is out final practice of the year and it’s worth 30% of our grade! I kid you not) she tells us to put everything in her office so I offered and left while the rest of the group got yelled at more. The short walk to her office in our class I got bombarded by the rest of my class asking me for some (you would think they never had pizza before but it is high school so what can you expect) I went back and the guys told us the story apparently they where walking to the class when they looked around the corner to make sure the coast was clear, it was, the guy with the pizza turned the corner when the teacher walked right in front of him and she released what was happening, without giving guy 2 a warning to leave, *he* turned the corner just to get caught. 

I’m the end we got the pizza at the end of the class and a telling off by the teacher

tifu,"This was yesterday but I forgot to post, but It started with my daily weekday routine of taking the kids to school and in particular on Thursdays, taking my friend's son to school a town away. Really not important actually.

The wife was home and took some of the load off me that day by taking our kids in but she couldn't drop our (feux) surrogate son off due to scheduling. So it's him and I, get to leave 10 min later than normal, so I get my morning cigarette ready to smoke after I drop him off. Brand new pack, just opened, took one out, put the pack on the table in my garage. We're off. Mission success. Boy dropped off and I'm back home now. Wife was almost back from her things so I say fuck it and smoke one to kill the time till she pulls up.

This is when I noticed the pack of smokes is gone. I *did* leave my garage door wide open (up until yesterday, never quite thought anything of it when I left the house for 30-40 min at a time). Well, nothing's ever gone missing but for reasons that I don't feel like typing out on mobile right now, I may have already been suspicious someone would sneak into my garage to smoke cigarettes. Not often enough to raise my ire and always within a window of time that it could just as likely been a friend that was over and I forgot. This time the pack is gone though. 

Quick aside: smokes are still MIA.

Through a series of boring details and trains of thought, the wife and I ended up calling the county (we're outside the city) and just wanted to notify them that we think someone walked into our garage while we were gone (I hate getting police involved but it was quite a strange feeling when you have something stolen from your house, I've never quite felt that before). We didn't even want a follow up or anything, just a ""hey, weird activity here, heads up"" and we do live in a pretty isolated neighborhood so it didn't seem too busybody-ish to call them. Sheriff show up, talks to us, but it's only the smokes that are missing so it's really not a big deal.

Fast forward 1.5 hours now. We've been powerwashing the house and getting the yard together and we're inside the garage taking a smoke break when I see a silver or white/gold RAV4 drive into my neighborhood looking very interested at the houses. Within less than 5 minutes I saw him exiting the neighborhood. It's a really small neighborhood, maybe 24 houses, one road in, one road out. It has a fork that splits into two cul-de-sacs. That was not enough time for someone to pick up what they forgot, or enough time to drop someone off. I pointed it out to the wife when he pulled in how they we're looking at our garage, and how they are leaving already. 

The gears start turning again. They didn't live here, I didn't recognize the driver or the car, and I just had things stolen from my garage earlier that morning while this guy is looking into our houses. This guy is up to no good!

Incidentally (and before the story ends, not consequentially) the driver was a middle aged black man. My kid's entire middle school of 6-700 students has like four black kids across all three grades to give you an idea of where this is about to go wrong....

Well we convinced ourselves this dude goes around to nice neighborhoods during the day and jacks Amazon boxes. Let's follow him, if we see him in the other neighborhood down the road, that has to be what's going on! Why else is some dude in an unmarked busted bumper RAV4 just poking into neighborhoods straight creeping on houses? So we jump in the car a few minutes after he had left and our brains started assuming the worst and see if we can catch him.


First neighborhood, nothing. This is a wild goose chase, and we're hungry and we'll just have to be more vigilant with our garage in the future. Let's go get some food.

We leave that neighborhood, head back on the road that (doesn't) connect these neighborhoods but then  remember there's one more road that leads to really nice houses coming up, let's take a quick look...

Son if a bitch if there isn't the same black man with his back doors open, reversed into the first house on the street. All by himself. Why does someone that lives two roads away need to creep down the wrong neighborhood? All the circumstantial evidence points to this guy does NOT live there and we totally have a cat burglar on our hands. Time to call 911. 

Sheriff's get there QUICK. I think they took our issue with a slice of sincerity and were still around in the area. Dudes's still in the driveway. Bam, just fucking Hardy Boys'd his ass. Well, we were parked outside the neighborhood at this point as dispatch told us the officer will want to talk to us afterwards. I couldn't just stay in the car and I'm a sucker for total disclosure, so I wanted to clear the air, even from a distance I can tell the situation wasn't escalating.

My nerves are still super heightened because I thought I caught this guy red handed, but the dude is driving off. Clearly the officer found no issue. Fuck me, this guy MUST feel like he's being singled out because he's black, so I waved my him down before he went off and said to him, ""Hey sir, I just wanted to let you know this whole mess was my fault, it's not because your black, but I had someone steal something from my garage and then I saw your car slowly come in and out of my dead-end neighborhood, and I'm really sorry"" well, the way I lead in was supposed to warm and sincere and maybe we could laugh at it, but in hindsight, he didn't have a lot of room to be convinced it wasn't because he was black. So yeah, he drives off absolutely convinced otherwise. Fuck. Goddamnit u/phweak, shouldn't have even opened your mouth.

After he drives off, the cop is still outside the house we found this guy at and tells me everything is on the up and up. He won some property from an auction and was picking it up, which explains the creeping. The guy is older, so quite possibly like my dad, he might not use GPS, and in general, all the behaviors added up. So I stand there. Looking like an idiot (still somewhat wet-rat looking from powerwashing) and sounding like a racist. The optics are totally against me here, I called again because a black dude was in my neighborhood. Fuck me. So yeah, now that dude will probably never come back and I wouldn't blame him.

TL;DR Cigarettes taken from garage, feels violating. 1.5-2 hours later, car creeps into my neighborhood (one road in, one road out), looking at houses slowly, immediately leaves neighborhood. He just so happens to be black. Find him down two roads down in another neighborhood, reversed and with his back doors open now. Assume it's a package thief/cat burglar, call cops again, guy is clear to go and pretty sure cops think I'm super racist now.

tifu,"A little back story:

I live in the country and have very slow internet at home, so when I need to upload or download something at bit bigger and I go to town and use the free internet that many chain restaurants offer and I'm normally a very normal person. 

The TIFU moment started last Friday when I was home alone and decided to ""please myself"" as a reward for a long week of hard work. I take my laptop and headphones out and find a satisfying video I've previously downloaded  and do the deed to completion and shut the lid to subsequently fall asleep. 

I wake up Saturday morning, well rested and refreshed, have a little coffee and breakfast and decide to go on with my day, since I don't have much on the agenda, I decide it would be a great day to update my website, so I grab my laptop and head to our local Boston pizza and sit down at the bar where the full-time, friendly waitress greets me and take my order, I'll have ""the usual"" I said, and proceeded to open the lid of my laptop  to get started on my work. 

To my, and especially the waitress' surprise, the video from the night before started full blast, since I had my headphones on when doing the deed the volume of the speakers were set on max for when I listen to music in the house with it so it was LOUD! 

She looked at me confused, embarrassed and a little disgusted, and here I am closing the lid as fast as I could, but the video kept playing and blasting the sound of some stepmother moaning from the pleasure provided from her step-son...  

So I garb the laptop, said so sorry, put a $20 on the counter and ran to never return. 

I now need to find a new pizza joint...

TL;DR: Watched porn the night before and the moaning sound of a horny step-mom went blasting at my local Boston pizza.",TIFU by blasting porn at a family restaurant
tifu,"This happened this afternoon (it's currently 11h15 pm for me) while I was with some friends studying for a math test we had this evening. 

Because none of us were really understanding or motivated to studied, we started discussing video games and ended up on fortnite, emotes, and doing them IRL.

When I was to show a fortnite emote called ""Lock it up"" because a friend said it was hard to do it IRL, as soon Twitter opened, the first thing on the feed was a woman completely naked, twerking on the tub, and believe, you could see it all!
I was so embarrassed, so ashamed (I guess)!! I acted like nothing, like it was some sort of a bug, but I know my female friend noticed, it was hard to miss that video. She also acted normal, but I'm so embarrassed! She's a really nice friends, and I have a tough time making friends, much less trusting them.

Now I don't feel so bad about it, but whenever that crosses my mind, I want to dig a hole, jump inside, and stay there for 50 years. It really sucked

Anyway, this happened a few minutes ago and am trying to fix my fuck up. 

So I haven't played minecraft on PC in a while since my usual laptop was broken 4 years ago. About a week ago after I graduated high school i was able to install linux on my chromebook and play minecraft. 

Today my brother and I decided to play a bit of it together so he made a realms server and we hopped in. We were playing for a few minutes before I got hungry and went to the kitchen to make some wings. I got a pot, put some water, and cranked the stove up and went back to continue playing minecraft with my brother. I think you can see where this is going...

We keep on playing, find some iron, redstone, coal, the good stuff when all of a sudden I catch a whiff of something, I turn to my brother,
""Is...is that weed""
*sniff sniff*
""Did you cook something?""
""Oh shit""

As we run out our room we are greeted by a smoke bomb and tear gas merged in one. The smell is unbearable and you can barley see anything through the smoke. I ran to the the stove to get the pot and ran outside to clear up the smoke but it's just too fucking much. As I type this there is still a shit ton of smoke in the house and it's not clearing up at all.

Wings didnt survive, our lungs are being blackened, my mom is going to pop off when she gets home, and I still havent found diamonds.

This just happened like 20 mins ago, and it is single handedly the most bizarre, and disgusting thing that's ever happened to me.

For context I guess, my bathroom light went out earlier on today and as a result, tonight I had to use the toilet in the dark. And me being the clown I am never thought to bring my phone in with me for light.

So its 3:30AM, and I'm sitting on the toilet in complete darkness, doing my business. I finish and feel around on the ground for the tp. I find it, roll some out and get to wiping, but as wipe I feel something wipe along my ""area"". Confused and unable to see what it was I opened the bathroom door slightly to let in light. I lifted the tp up to the crack in the door and right there sitting on the tp was a fucking slug. I don't know how the slug got on the tp, or how I didn't feel it on my hand while I was rolling it out. All I know is I've just wiped my ass with a slug

tifu,"Obligatory didn’t happen today, but happened earlier in the week, but still in progress. 

Ok, for background, I’m a closeted bisexual guy, and I’ve never officially “come out” to anyone. The only guy who does know is also gay, and he kind of helped me figure it out, so I guess you could say he saw me come out to myself. 

A couple days after we first discussed actually being gay/bi, I started noticing all of the guys around me who were looking pretty good. One guy in particular was a young flight attendant who looked really cute in the lilac purple uniform shirt and vest with his bleached white hair thrown over his head. In an attempt to convey this to my friend, I took a picture of him during the safety demonstration, and wrote the caption “Don’t tell me he isn’t super hot”. I chose his name, and sent it to him on Snapchat. Except I didn’t. I accidentally sent it to a different friend with the same first name, who definitely did NOT know that I was anything but straight.

Here’s where it goes from bad to worse: I wasn’t thinking straight, so I immediately sent him a chat telling him not to open it and that it was a joke for someone else (which is about the worst lie I’ve ever told). He didn’t see the message until he had opened it, so I’m pretty sure he knows I’m not straight at the very least. 

But on the bright side, he took it well, he basically said it’s all good, so either he bought that it was a joke or he knows I’m gay/bi. I’d be willing to bet the latter, but I don’t get back from this trip for another few days, so I won’t know until I get to talk to him face to face.

TL;DR: I accidentally might have come out to an unsuspecting friend by sending a snap of a cute guy to the wrong person with the caption, “Don’t tell me he’s not super hot”. Friend seems cool about it, but won’t actually know if he actually believes it/is cool with it until I can talk to him about it.",TIFU by (maybe) coming out to a friend.
tifu,"This actually happened yesterday, unlike most stories here. On mobile so I apologize for any formatting errors. 

**BACKGROUND**

So about a year and a half ago, we were just chilling at her place. I forgot I had a homework assignment due at midnight, so she let me use her computer to do it.

Well her homepage was reddit and I noticed she had over 900 messages. I knew she Reddits but the first thing that came to my mind was “Man, she has to be a karma whore to the extreme; what the fuck does she comment on?” So I went to her profile when I discovered, oops, that was her NSFW account. In my defense, we know each other’s Reddit handles and send each other posts all the time; I just thought it was a regular account. When I realized it wasn’t, I x’d out almost immediately, finished my homework, and then just left it at that.

A week later, I was feeling horny, and I remembered about her account. It took a bit of digging, but I managed to find her account again, and spanked it to her. Ever since, I pretty much regularly masturbate to her. It’s not that I want to have sex with her, BUT she is hot, and the taboo nature of looking at someone I knew kept it alluring.

Anyways, I majored fucked up when hanging out with her yesterday. Her boyfriend’s birthday was coming up, and she asked what she should give him. Like an idiot, I answered “you should give him a strip tease with those fishnets you have.” IDK why the fuck I said that; I had fishnets in my head because I spanked it that morning, and I forgot to realize that it was actually HER who posted a picture of herself in fishnets a couple days ago. She asked “how did I now she had fishnets” and I tried to just say I was joking, but I eventually admitted I knew her NSFW account.

She asked for how long and I was honest; for the better part of a year. She was **furious**.  She said those pictures are private pictures, and that they were not meant for my eyes. She said if I found her account, I should’ve just pretend I didn’t, and that she feels gross and violated and she wanted me to leave.

**FUCK UP**

Telling her was actually my first fuck-up, but the REAL fuckup was posting on Reddit about it. When I did, I INSTANTLY got bombarded with messages saying I’m a piece of shit and people who I die because I’m a disgusting, perverted freak. I’m not going to lie; I knew I fucked up about it big time, but I didn’t realize the gravity of the situation. 

After posting, I felt like a HUGE piece of shit. I decided, I was going to take a step back from the friendship. First, I wanted to apologize. I wanted to apologize to her for obvious reasons, but I decided that I also wanted to apologize to her boyfriend for disrespecting their relationship. 

So I tried calling her. She understandably didn’t answer, so I  decided to text her a huge apology instead. I then decided to call her boyfriend to apologize to him personally. Her boyfriend is actually an acquaintance of mine, which is also why I felt like I should apologize. 

To my surprise, he did pick up. I told him that I was sorry about everything and I’ve crossed some serious boundaries and that I’ll step away from the friendship if it’d make him comfortable. 

Well, he was completely confused and asked me to clarify. I told him that I figured my friend told him what happened, but the gist was that I found her NSFW account and hid it from her, and I violated her trust and I’m sorry. 

Well, he had absolutely NO idea what NSFW account I was talking about. We went back and forth but I realized; she was probably posting these without him knowing. I had no idea; I just assumed because they were dating, she’d of course tell him. 

Well, the cat was already out of the bag. So I came clean; I told him about the NSFW account and sent him the link. I felt like he deserved to know that his girlfriend was posting nudes behind his back for at least a year. 

He appreciated the fact that I told him, and he views as what she did as cheating, and confided is me that he’s going to break up with her.  I feel horrible for causing all of this drama. I’m a shit friend, and most definitely lost one of the best I’ve had, even if she was cheating. 

This all happened yesterday. I felt like a piece of shit yesterday, and I still do today. But at least one less person is getting cheated on. 

**FAQS** 

I posted this on amitheasshole originally yesterday (spoiler alert: I am). But I had a lot of repeated questions so I’ll address them preemptively

&gt;	Why did you ruin her relationship you perverted fuck?

I didn’t tell him to hurt her. Like I said, I was planning on stepping away from the friendship. Which is why I said I’ll step away from the relationship. 

I told him because I assumed he knew about the NSFW account. You know, because they’re monogamous? And posting your naked body regularly on Reddit is typically something you tell your monogamous boyfriend. 

&gt;	Why did I feel the need to apologize to him and not her?

You just didn’t read the damn post. I tried apologizing to her. I called her. She didn’t answer. So I texted her instead. 

I just decided that IN ADDITION, I was going to apologize to him. Because I disrespected their relationship. 

&gt;	Why didn’t you rat her out a year ago if you were so concerned about her cheating?

Because you numb-nuts; I DIDNT KNOW THAT HE WAS UNAWARE OF THE NSFW ACCOUNT. Why would I think she’s hiding a NSFW porn account from her boyfriend? That’s CLEARLY something you tell your SO. Jesus fucking Christ. 

I didn’t want to break them up. I wanted to apologize because I was told by 300 people that I’m a piece of shit. I tried, and I just made it worst. 

But it WASNT malicious. Period. And at the end of the day, she was (either by omission or explicitly) lying to him about this account. That’s not okay in a monogamous relationship, and she deserved to be called out. 

&gt;	You did this because you were mad of her reaction to you finding her nudes. 

I didn’t but if you want to tell yourself that, you can. 

**TL;DR I’ve been jacking off to my friend’s NSFW account for over a year. I let it slipped up that I did. She was pissed at me, so I came to Reddit to see if I was being unreasonable.

I’m thinking it’s a statement or something like that so I open it to print it off and realize it’s his entire medical history and treatments he’s had from like the past 10 years and he was last treated for some sexual disorder.

tifu,"So this happened a few years ago while we were on vacation to Italy. We were staying on this camping. One day we went all to the pool. At a given time my brother decided to go back to our trailer. Not so long after that, the camping closed the pool because it was break-time for the staff. So I was sitting there next to the water, getting bored. I thought, I might as well go back, grab my book and continue reading.

So I return to the trailer and I remember that my brother was there, I enter and I hear that the shower is turned on. I was like, aight let me scare him when he gets out (I was young and dumb). So I go to the bathroom, as quietly as possible I open the door, stick my head out and make this ugly face to scare him when he gets out (he normally doesn't take long showers and he was there before me, so he must come out anytime now). 

It took 5 seconds before I realised he wasn't showering. I was watching him masturbate.

The moment I realised I backed off, closed the door and grabbed my book and returned to the pool. 

I don't know whether or not he has seen me, for I closed the door quietly, but I can't get this image out of my head.

We had a few scuffles and usually made up a few hours later, but I dont see that happening now.

I got tired of him just wanting shit while I was practicing for it and he'd be the one upset when we didnt win.

tifu,"One of the outlets on the exterior west side of the house hasn't been working this spring, and the garage GFCI has been tripping as well, which then causes other outlets to die. I figured some water got into it over the winter or maybe ice damaged it. It is not the worst outlet to go dead, but we use an electric weed trimmer and it would be nice to be able to plug in there.

So, I found the circuit breaker that controlled the outlet, and I went out to the side of the house to dismantle it and maybe clear it out of water or whatever is stuck in there, or at least cap the wires until we can get an electrician to diagnose it.

Anyway I'm in the process of capping off the wires when I feel a HUGE jolt and the heat of 1000 suns running through my arm. I yanked my arm away in abject pain and terror and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK!!!"" Luckily I wasn't grasping it at the time or I might not be here.

I decided to do it and saw a lot of stuff lacking updates (plugins, themes etc). So, my FU was not doing a backup of everything before updating. When I updated the website's theme, everything went south. I got a fatal error when accessing the site.

I managed to get it back online in a matter of minutes, but the shit already hit the fan. Everything was out of place. The colors were lost, headers and footers were not there. It was basically just the theme, without anything customized.

tifu,"This happened about 20 minutes ago. I'm British and live in a small city called Chester. Now Chester is a city that was built by the Romans in 478 AD. This means the roads are super narrow and the pavements/sidewalks are super uneven. I cycle to work and since the roads are narrow it is common that you can't get past the line of cars waiting at the traffic lights. Instead of getting off my bike and pushing it to the front of the cars (so they could all see me and not run me off the road when the light turned green) I thought I would try and mount the pavement/sidewalk and go around them. That was my mistake. It was absolutely pissing it down and so it was both slippy and I couldn't accuracy assess the height of the pavement/sidewalk because there was a small river running beside it. I thought I was safe. Instead of mounting the pavement I end up sliding both wheels along the edge of the pavement/sidewalk and catapult myself off the side of my bike, shins first, onto the ground. Still pissing it down and with multiple pedestrians looking at me I do the British thing of laugh, pick up my bike, exclaim ""Well that wasn't the plan.""

Okay, so this happened a few years ago, but it's definitely a TIFU kind of thing. I watch porn sometimes. I used to watch it more often than I do now, but still I always have watched gangbang type of videos because let's face it, that's just what I'm into. Sorry not sorry.

Sometimes these videos involve a ""husband"" watching. I figured this was always just for show and that the guy is not a real husband, so it never bothered me much to think about it. I mean most porn is probably acting anyway. Well, there I was on pornhub or youporn (I don't remember exactly since there were a few different sites I went to) and started browsing videos as I unzipped and got ready to do the deed. Its important to note that I rarely have the sound on because hearing a dude groan totally kills the mood. This time I happened to give it a chance and turned up the sound a bit because I actually do like hearing the sound of bodies colliding. Again, sorry not sorry.

Let me get to the point. I was a couple minutes into a video and it didn't really show the woman's face. I was even nearly at climax. Then it happened. I heard the husband speak and say something encouraging to the six or so muscular dudes who were giving it to his wife. The voice sounded familiar, but I didn't think too much about it at first. Then the husband guy stepped into the shot. It was my dad.

At first I thought holy F, what is he doing? Does my mom know? Then it dawned on me. My mom was the lady getting plowed. I completely lost my mood and felt more shame than I ever thought possible. I have not told my parents about this and probably never will.

tifu,"Throwaway because of paranoia that is not grounded in reality. This all happened yesterday and I can’t talk about it with almost anyone.

Background: I am a 40 yr old married woman with a young child. My marriage is not great but I’m committed to it. As a young adult I cheated on a long term boyfriend and it’s one of the biggest regrets of my life because of how much it hurt him. I have had a crush on a guy at work for a couple of years now. I am probably obvious about it. I FEEL awkward around him. He’s spent the last year or two kind of toying with me/flirting in a fairly innocent manner, which of course only makes me feel more awkward. He’s a couple years older, single, but good looking and he knows it.

Yesterday we had an incident at work where a mistake by one of my people made one of his guys look bad. Because we were discussing sensitive personnel issues we had a closed door meeting in my office. We hashed out the work issues (me apologizing) and he told me he knew it wouldn’t happen again. Then he put his hand over my hand. I panicked and pulled my hand away. Knocked my hot coffee all over my lap and the floor. I don’t remember exactly what I said but I THINK I said something like “no, I’m not doing this. But you’re not wrong about my feelings” in pretty much the most awkward way ever. (Think high squeaky voice, trying to clean up coffee all over my pants, heart beating out of my chest) He grabbed some paper towels and handed them to me, nodded, and walked out. He has not made eye contact with me since. We have a follow up meeting Monday morning.

I called a close friend who lives a billion miles away to talk about it and she thought ifu because he might not have meant it in a coming-on-to-me kind of way, he might have been trying to console a friend. I am horrified. Every time I think about it I can’t breathe I’m so embarrassed.

So tonight, I get off of my second job and go to work on an assignment due tonight at 12 in one of my hybrid (half online, half offline) classes. I spent a good amount of time on it, wrote everything I needed, cited all my sources and wrote it directly into the website where it gets turned in.

It was close to being 12 and while I was working satan decided he needed attention in the form of biting me hARD on the arm. I move him off a few times, figuring I can pull out a toy after I do my work for him to play with.

He then jumped on my keyboard and deleted all my work. All of it. He hit the back button and the tab with all my work closed. 10 minutes before it was due.

When he noticed me walking with my dog, he entered the car through rear passenger door, and started chilling there. He lighted up the cigar.

Context: I did a AITA about this but here's the summary:

I used to coach a summer camp for kids focused on running. The coordinator of the activities asked me to coach an older age group, 16-21, mixed. Two mothers voiced concerns about me probably being a  predator while their daughters were signing up. One of them wanted me to tell her daughter nothing sexual was going to happen. 


There have never been incidents before. The case got the mayor's attention who called for a meeting with the parents. Mayor let her daughter sign up as a vote of confidence and asked the parents to put it to a vote. I felt like a dickbag for almost a week ( between the signing up and the meeting about the vote) for potentially coming of as a predator but I tried to be understanding about the complaints. 

The meeting was yesterday evening. 

It was, for the lack of a better term, an absolute clown fiesta. I can't even fully summarise it.

- everyone who reacted to the vote gave their trust, but 4 people didn't reply. They did show up.

- one of the objecting mothers gave a 10 minute speech. I have reason to believe she was projecting. It featured the sentence "" hot, trained, muscular body with endurance for hours, he's going to break these girls hearts or something else"". No one interrupted her. 

- the other mother objected because her daughter has a thing for older men. It got pretty graphic when she described her own daughter's behaviour towards teachers, older neighbours, policemen... these comments were made in private though. And that mother said I was basically too shy and polite to handle her daughter's antics. 
She did publically say she suspects me to be a virgin/ sexually inexperienced/ asexual. "" not interested in women or men"". She was the one who asked me to tell her daughter nothing sexual was going to happen. 

- one of the dads called me attractive. He was pretty adamant about it. He lives in my mom's street.

- A group of people said my face isn't attractive but it "" looks honest"". 3 people called me too skinny. The mayor shut down that discussion after 20 something minutes of back and forth over my attractiveness. I think it was about 70- 30 ( minority finding me attractive). They all agreed I wouldn't make any inappropriate moves, but some doubted if I would resist someone coming on to me.

- there's a private facebook group about me, made by some of the people who signed up, and the header is a picture of me shirtless with my head cut out. The mayor saw this on her daughter's phone. She mentioned this in private. 

I never should have even considered this. I'm no longer considered a predator, but 30 people gave their opinion on how I look while I was there.

tifu,"Mandatory, many many years ago. I was 12 and the hormones were full on raging. 

The first part is a pretty standard mistake a lot of developing young men make. After burning through any substance in the house that could be used as lube; we’re talking aloe vera gel through vegetable oil, never thought to crack the mayo jar open and that’s probably for the best, I’ve run out of options. Like many other dudes that age, the need to crank out a few swimmers comes about at least 4 times a day, and my $5 a week allowance ain’t gonna cover it. So while washing my hair, I see some potential. So I gob a fist full of suave and start cranking it out.

 I turn around in the shower to keep my love goo from getting washed away, and what I didn’t understand at the time is that the hot water hitting my back desensitized all the other skin on my body, including good ol’ sgt. sausage. This is compounded by the fact that is now late at night and I’ve already deployed the troops at least 3 more times that day. So, in my hormonally induced Viking nut rage I’m cranking at my unit like only a skinny, spastic soda laden pre teen can: we’re talking 3000 rpm jacking, arm starting to look like it’s an optical illusion, furious squirrel digging for a nut, arms going numb sort of jerking off. I’ve gotten pretty good at my favorite new hobby this year. 

This “massages” the shampoo so deep into my skin that when I finally get out what can only be described as a stinger from all the soap in my urethra and look down, my whole dick is red going on the verge of purple. I try to wash it off, horrible horrible pain setting in, to no avail. So I drink a ton of water, piss out whatever left over shampoo is in my dickhole, and head on to some uneasy rest for school the next day. 

When I wake up (Thursday morning for the sake of the story), the damage has really set it. Not only is my dick still as red as those shitty atomic fireball candies your 80 y.o. grandpa used to eat, but it is now wrinkled and cracking like his skin after after a day with no sunscreen on the beaches of Maui. It’s bleeding, I can’t touch it, it’s starting to peel around the head, every horrible sensation you could possibly imagine, check it off the list. Getting my boxers on is no treat, and the skinny jeans I thought were cool at the time literally made me cry trying to scrape those thigh huggers past my wounded warrior. 

But I soldier on, get through the school day and try to avoid any accidental dick on anything contact. But now the pressure is building...

I’m 12, and have been jerking off at least 4 times a day since I hit puberty. It’s my hobby, my passion, my obsession and my curse all rolled up into one. And I can’t touch it. I can barely even look at it. I’ve never been tested so hard in my entire life. And guess what? I fail that test in dramatic fashion.

My family had a camping trip planned for this coming weekend, and being the big boy (and in hindsight, furious masturbator) that I was, I finally got my own tent. So I get it all set up on Friday night, dick still peeling in agony, and stave off the penile firing orders I’m getting from the boys in blue downstairs for one uneasy night. I wake up on Saturday morning to a dick as pink as an uncooked hotdog peeing like ball python, still bleeding in spots but somewhere along the road to recovery. And the impulse to crank one out has become overwhelming.

I try once in the morning, raw, like the moronic hormone monster I was, and rip it slightly. I get a tear in my eye, both from the pain and from the promised release I so desperately needed, and move on. A normal day ensues, kickball with my cousins, barbecue at the end of the day, sodas and kicking back country style. Pretty good day minus the horrible disfigurement I’ve caused myself below the belt, but my family has no way of knowing so as far as anybody can tell, I’m just a little bit antsy but having a pretty good time. 

That night there is a pretty big storm coming on. My tent has a weather cover that drops down right above the door. As the storm descends and ruins the rest of our night, the depressing maelstrom of camptown disappointment does exactly what you’d expect to a 12 year old boy. It makes me violently horny.

I need it. And I need it now. It’s been 3 days. The longest three days of my young life any by far the longest I’ve ever spent not pulling out clue goo since I figured out how. So to the sound of nothing but howling wind and oppressive rainfall, I reach out to the top of my tent, hands cupped like a beggar looking for pocket scraps, and scoop up a palms worth of rainwater. And then, in ravenous fashion, I start going at. It’s still peeling, bleeding even, but I don’t care. Between the horrible pangs of penile agony is the bittersweet sensation I’ve been seeking for days. So through the ripping, peeling, bleeding agony, I pull like the anchor on a middle school tug of war team. All my might, all my speed, all my skills developed in months of ravenously jerking off are coming into play. I somehow manage to launch a blood spattered, pressure forged blast of barely post pubescent skump all over my tent door. And in the aftermath, as my battered unit shrinks from exhaustion, I’m simultaneously satisfied and horrified at what I’ve just done. I’ve mangled my reviving penis to the point of near oblivion, all for the sake of relieving a pressure that can only be described as biblical. 

Was it worth it? All things considered I’d say so, only God knows what happens on the fourth day, and I prefer to leave it that way. 

My dick has since recovered, and I’m down to about one nut a day as a recovering addict. I’ve got a healthy stockpile of age appropriate lubrications for all my contemporary self gratification, and I’m at peace with the horrible atrocities I’ve committed on myself.

TL;DR 
I used shampoo as lube and it ruined my dick, made it peel, crack and bleed. That didn’t stop me from using rainwater on it three days later out of post pubescent desperation for one good nut. I ripped my dick in the process, but I got it out. It was worth it.",TIFU by ripping my dick while using rainwater as lube.

Not my story, but my friend's. He doesn't use Reddit, so I posted this for him.

This happened 3 days ago.

**Context:**

In Poland we have grades 1 to 6. 1 is the worst and 6 is the best. My friend wanted to get a 4 in math at the end of the year, since the average scores will be on your school certificate, and you give it to your high school that you chose since we are in the 8th class.

We have behavior points, you get positive and negative. To get ""excellent"" behavior on your certificate you need 300 positive and the amount of negatives has to be less than 30. Otherwise it will be very good.

We have teachers for subjects and a (i don't know how to say it, maybe a class teacher) that just is when we go on trips and have normal lessons with. (for polish people, it's a wychowawca).

**Story:**

**Day 1:**

As I said, my friend wanted to get an 4. He asked our math teacher if she could give him a test or ask him to get the better grade. She said yes, and he would have to do an test/be asked by her the next day.

**Day 2:**

My friend sat by himself in the class (we sit in 2 people tables) as the teacher told him, and she chose the questions that he would have to complete. He was thinking that the question was hard.

He said: ""This question is hard, maybe I could pay you for a better grade?"". My friend thought this was a funny joke, but my teacher didn't. She told him to sit down and he couldn't do the questions now. She was really offended by this and one of the things she said was ""I teach in this school for a lot of years and no student was this disrespectful to her"".

She told him that he will write an essay about why his joke was inappropriate and it had to be signed by his parents.

After some time, she did let him write that test, since she teaches math and behavior points are two different things. She talked with our class teacher and he got 20 negative points later. It won't affect his behavior score, since he didn't even have close to 300 positive points

**Day 3:**

He gave the teacher the essay and said sorry about his behavior. She read the essay and commented on it by saying: ""**FriendName,** think three times before saying anything.""

He got the better grade and now we are joking about his stupidity.

TL;DR: Don't joke to your teachers, especially when you want a better grade.

tifu,"I hate letting people know I have a crush. Even people who aren’t that person. Makes me feel vulnerable. So I never tell anyone unless I’m literally about to ask them out or whatever. I was in drivers ed a few months ago, I did it with my best friend let’s call Q. Q gets crushes every day of the week, she keeps a little list of them, and coupe probably have a full crush baseball team. When we met M, my crush, I was pretty sure she liked him. But I like him too. I didn’t tell her of course, it was a silly drivers ed class. And he didn’t go to my school and he’d been held back a year since he was adopted, so even though he was our age, he was a freshmen. Plus he dated my friend in middle school and even though it was barely a relationship they didn’t like each other at all.Also his mom was my old math teacher and I pretty much failed her class, and had been doing my best to avoid her ever since. So it was complicated. I never had any notions of actually doing anything about it. We added each other on snap, and he often posted those anonymous polls. I flipped through them and saw multiple girls confessing their crushes. Maybe he’d faked them but I honestly think they were genuine, he was a really nice guy. Forward to now. I don’t really like him anymore. He’s a nice guy but it’s very complicated, he’s kinda out of my league. Up until then I skipped over those anonymous polls, but I decided to get closure, I confessed. It was very late at night. No one else was up. His response was that he could tell who it was, as I’d snapped him moments after the anonymous poll went in. I literally thought to myself, maybe I shouldn’t snap him right after the poll. But I was so tired and dumb. I’m such a dumbass.

tifu,"This happened last night 

So last night one of my roommates and I were watching billiards videos and got hyped to go out and play some. We talked one of our other roommates to come with us (too easy, he goes out every night). But we knew we would not be able to get our last roommate out. So I pulled the “we’re going to the store” line and he got ready right away. 

He wasn’t the most hyped when we pulled up to the bar (of course). I bought him drinks because I did fee a little bad. We played a few games of 8 ball and he started to lose interest and became quite.  This is where things take a turn. 

Some backstory, he’s had a gambling problem for the last couple years with it getting to the worst last month (he lost everything). After his big final lost he stopped and started being the talented self he is and was doing really good with everything in life again (most happy I’ve seen him in the past two years). Our entire household was proud of him and showed the support he needed. 

Back to what happened last night, him sitting quietly at our table, one of the other roommates gives him a dollar and tells him to play it in the video lottery machines. Ever so quickly he gets up and heads straight there. After about one minute I see him coming back. I figured he lost since he wasn’t making much expressions and it was very quick. When he got back to the table he started to smirk and lifted up his hand with a receipt that showed he had won 100 bucks. He then said that he’s back and he’s going to the casino the next day (our payday).  We joked about it a little bit, then he became serious and started rambling about his plan to go gamble. This is when i started to worry.

tifu,"This just happened a few minutes ago. Also, disclaimer, I am FTM trans so yes I was wearing boxers, but there are tits involved.

So I got home a few hours ago, did some things around the house, hung out. Then I went to my bedroom, took off all my clothes besides some boxers  (it's hot as hell) and went on my phone. When I laid down I noticed a little dot on my leg. Well, that dot was a tick. I pulled the little guy out, found some tape, wrapped him up, and went to throw it in the trash can in the kitchen, not at all realizing I am still mostly naked. So the second I step out of my room I look down the hallway and lock eyes with my younger brother. We both run back to our separate room as fast as possible, and I yell ""Well that was awkward!"" 

I have since told him not to mention it ever again and how I was panicing about a tick. We will both be scarred for a while.

Oh, boy, this just happened and I'm still trying to figure out how I messed up this bad. Ok, so for context, my GF and I have been dating for a few months now, started mid January. Anyway, we send each other nudes, we're really open and stuff. Anyway, sometimes I save the pics, not to show to friends cuz that's a dick move, but just for myself. Anyway, on Facebook, I'm apart of a group that posts lewd pics of celebs, pornstars, or cosplayers. I'm actually pretty popular in that group as I have a big collection of lewd photos. If you think you know where this is going, you're probably half right. So, I was on FB and wanted to post some pics of Rhianna. So, I posted the pics, then my dog started whining, so I put down the phone and went to check on him (he just had to pee lol). Anyway, after that I had lunch and played some games. I realize I don't have my phone on me, so I go to my room and see all these messages and notifications, but the one that worried me was 5 missed calls from my GF (apparently my ringer was off too, as I turn it off before I sleep and forgot to turn it back on). So, I called her back and before I could even say hello, she yelled at me: WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU?! HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?! TAKE THEM DOWN?!
At first I'm confused, so I ask her what she's talking about. She tells me to check Facebook. I go on and see that I've posted my girlfriend's nudes, which she had sent the night before, instead of the Rhianna pics. I was worried, but still confused as to how my GF saw these pics as the group as I supposedly posted them in was ""secret"". That means only members of the group can see what's posted and posts can't be shared from that group. That's when I realized my dumbass had posted the pics on my own personal page, and based on the number of reactions and comments, a good majority of my friends had seen them. I immediately took the post and apologized to my girlfriend. I told her what happened and she was understandably upset. She had to hang up as she was on her break at work and it was over. She's coming over in a few hours and I'm dreading the conversation. 

TL;DR: Wanted to post lewds in Facebook group, ended up posting GF's nudes on my personal page.

Update: I took your advice and bought her favorite wine and cooked her dinner (her favorite meal). She came and we talked. She wasn't as upset and when I explained she calmed down a bit. So, we didn't break up, but I'm on thin ice. She won't send me nudes for at least the rest of the summer and she made me leave the FB group (which I was fine with) in case this ever happened again. Now we, mainly me, have to damage control for everyone who saw them and who knows how many saved them.",TIFU By Posting My Girlfriend's nudes on my Facebook Profile

Kindergarten. 

Nothing but a bunch of mini humans trying to figure out what life's about, napping and sticking Play-Doh in each other's hair

After they read us ""Little Red Riding Hood"" me and my classmates were all super excited in a super smart discussion(props to the teacher for her solid story telling skills) and we were taking turns giving our opinion on the fairy tale. Jimmy told everyone how he thinks kids should not go alone to the forest and blah blah. After Jimmy's divine revelation...my turn arrived. 

-""So _____  Tell us how do you feel about the story?""

""I think that wolf is definitely a smartass son of a bitch"" I said without even blinking

Teacher quickly shifted her face to a surprised laugh as my classmates were clueless

""What?!!"" 

-"" Yeah my granpa would say that Wolf is definitely a son of a bitch""

My parents got notified same day and explained to me that some words are really not nice to say. But it didn't stop there as other kids arrived home and questioned their parents about the meaning of my complex wording and afterwards began linking other words they heard as swear words

For a couple months other kids revealed more swear words they learned.  Most of us discussed our new vocabulary findings and invented some of our own... and we traded them.

 ""You like my rainbow pencil? Tell me the word you told Kevin and I'll lend it ""

It was a swear market and I was the cause!

 After several attempts and teacher/parents efforts the dark swear market fully stopped operating some weeks later.

&gt;""Guys I'd really appreciate it if you could stop eating at your desks; we have the break room for a reason. There's crumbs being left of the desks and chairs and, since we don't have set seats for everybody, the next person using your space isn't liking it very much. So just keep that in mind alright?""

I've only eaten at my desk once and this was way before, so the entire time I'm hearing this every week and I'm thinking, ""Who the hell keeps eating at their damn desk??""

Fast forward to now, I get to work and my chair is crumby as all hell. A few minutes later, my boss calls me to his office to talk about raise- but the following conversation also took place:

Boss: Hey, not sure if you've taken anything away from the weekly meetings, but the food crumbs thing...?

Me: Oh yea I usually eat at the break room anywa-

Boss: You're the main problem.  
Me: .

Boss: Yea sometimes people just aren't aware of it so maybe keep an eye out next time. (Other boss) has been complaining about crumbs on the chair after you've used it.

Me: Yea for sure, sorry about that.

So I go back to my chair thinking ""So all those crumbs were MY crumbs?!"". But I haven't eaten in my space ever? Minus my breakfast energy bar that I've literally only just started eating yesterday (which I place a tissue under to catch the crumbs).

I've also realized crumbs in that space for a few weeks too and only 2 people ever use that seat- Me and my other boss.

And that's when it clicked...

I have this OCD problem where I cannot stop cutting my nails. It's so bad, 8/10 of my nails are in a U shape going inwards. So I'm doing all this and the nail bits and flying everywhere- every single day.

Well this week I'm working a bit later, so I've stayed in bed while my GF and the rest of her family go to work. She must not have told her dad that I would still be there until a bit later.

I'm sat on my phone and then I hear her dad get up and walk around, but I'm still in bed assuming he knows I'm here. That is until I hear loud moans coming from the other room.

Her dad thinks he is home alone, and is currently watching porn on a very loud volume..

I've tried moving around and playing my phone alarm so he knows that I'm here without him thinking I've caught him in the act, but the moans just keep going. I don't know what to do, but I need to get up and actually go to work in about 10 minutes, so I hope it won't last long. 

I've never felt so awkward and I'm not even the one who has been caught watching porn. Should I tell my GF to text or call him?

&amp;#x200B;

I (F21) got into a plane and sat next to an older lady. As we were preparing to take off I noticed that she was holding her head and I got a bit worried.I usually have anxiety when talking to people but I was really concerned.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't know if she was from my country -Croatia(from where we were flying from) or from somewhere else so I decided to talk to her in English. I asked if she was okay and she turned to me, drinking a pill, and saying she was okay but a  bit sick since she had some surgery.At least that's what I understood.She spoke half English, Croatian and German  combined.I realized we spoke the same language but I felt too anxious to tell her.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that was the end of it  , but no.This is where it all starts.She ended up being VERY talkative.Also talking in broken English with a lot of Croatian and German words.I understood her completely but pretended to be a foreigner and not knowing what she is saying.It was very awkward for me but I couldn't escape since we were flying and I couldn't break my lie because I was too deep into it.I found it kinda funny in the beginning but then things turned to worse.

&amp;#x200B;

And now this, I wanted to die and be swallowed by the sea.She decided to show me her folk music she adores.Very important to note is that there was a very small baby behind us -sleeping.As i mentioned , shes an older lady and doesn't know her way with the technology.She BLASTED that folk music thru- so the whole plane heard it , I'm sure heavens could of heard it.The mother of the baby started yelling at me and I apologized so so so much , I became red as a crab.The old lady didn't allow me to touch her phone so I couldn't even help her.It has continued for 5 minutes and the whole plane was yelling at me and at her.The baby woke up and cried.The mother started giving me threats and I just didn't know what to do.The old lady finally turned it off and started telling them all kinds of swears ( with kids on the plane) and she was quite mad at them for making her feel so bad.She turned to me and said they cant take the folk music and laughed.She kept blaming them and saying that people this days are so sensitive.I couldn't laugh.I was just embarrassed.I pretended to fall asleep the rest of the flight.

&amp;#x200B;

When we landed she was talking to me AGAIN.I was trying to not lead her on in the convo.I just left but found her right next to me in the bus.She said she fell walking out of the plane and again started talking to me.I stopped responding and just making an awkward smile.I felt bad that she fell but I was just too anxious at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's it folks ,after that I never saw her again.Note taken: never talk to people ever again.

&amp;#x200B;

Also she absolutely REFUSED to use the belt thingy you have to have on in the plane.She would take it off as soon as the flight attendant would walk away.

After I just arrived back to from my parents to my place, I decided to treat myself with some fried chicken for dinner. Everything was going great until I decided that I need some entertainment while I'm preparing the chicken.

I decided to put my phone on the top of my knife rack, leaning it towards a knife for better visibility. I loaded up YouTube and started a video. After the video ended I wanted to stop it from auto-playing another, totally irrelevant video and as I touched the screen, the phone decided to do a somersault right into the batter and sank immediately.

I quickly grabbed it and rinsed it down, gladly no harm was done (beside a little quietness of the speaker due to the water), thanks to it being waterproof. My only problem now is that the cover and the phone too smells like fried chicken and I can't get it off.

tifu,"Obligatory didn’t happen today, took place about three weeks ago. 

Names will be changed in case anyone knows my account. 

My buddy Gabriel invited me over to his house to drink on a Saturday night. I told him I had a 2-C shift at work, which meant I’d get off around 11:00 PM and be at his house around 11:30. 

Keep in mind that I’m highly against taking breaks because my managers always try to schedule me to have 38-39 hours, as they hate letting me hit OT, even though plenty of my coworkers do it when they’re not needed. I ate at 1:30 PM and didn’t take a break at work,  then went home and showered and got ready. 

Got to Gabe’s house and his friends Jack and Angela are there. Introduce myself, they’re joking and talking and stuff and I’m kind of just sitting by myself because I’m kind of nervous. I’ve only really gone drinking one time, which was with my dad when we were on a cruise to Mexico. But I was eating a lot before and during, so I barely felt it. 

Drinks start pouring and I decided I could hang with the big boys, so I started pounding them back. It was something called “Liquid Marijuana” and it was a bright blue color. I started to feel dizzy after the second one, but I needed to keep going. After the fourth one, I decided I needed to leave because it was 3:00AM and my dad was going to kill me for being out so late, especially while drinking. So I stood up and, according to Gabe, went face-first into his glass patio table, the back of my head hit his wooden bench, and then face-first into his concrete patio. 

I remember bits and pieces of the rest of the night, mostly everyone holding me up as I puked my guts out onto his patio and yard. They then brought me into the house and laid me on the couch. I only had the strength to pull the trash can close to me and vomit in it before passing back out again. Ended up smelling like vomit and it was awful. I don’t remember anything besides that, but I was apparently flirting with Angela while drunk, rather heavily. I woke up around 9:00AM to Angela saying she was taking me home. Got home, my dad didn’t say anything or ask where I had been, so I just showered and acted like nothing happened. Told him later what had happened and he just laughed his ass off and told me it was a very good thing I got it out of my system before I left for the military, as there’s supposedly a lot of drinking once you’re in. But I’ve been invited back to Gabe’s house because “I’m the man” which makes me feel pretty good considering It was my first time socially drinking, and I’m only 20. Probably won’t do it again after that, though. 


TL;DR: Got invited to drink at my buddy’s house and didn’t eat anything for 10 hours beforehand, or anything during. Blacked out and puked all over my buddy’s patio and lawn, and partially on myself. Dad thought it was hilarious, but a very good lesson to learn.",TIFU by not eating before getting drunk for the first time with friends

I went to Urgent Care and told them to save all of the lives before getting to me. I was worried that it would bleed at night or I'd chew on it and then it would bleed. So embarrassing. They told be to eat soft food and ice chips until it heals and take over the counter meds for pain and swelling.

But to be allowed to eat breakfast, we had to wear a special paper bracelet, which identified us as guests of the Hotel.
As soon as I got mine, I put it on. However, it is not very easy to get that thing off without damaging it, as it is closed by sticking the ends together.
Well, I didn’t want to break it and so I just wore it the entire time, 4 days in a row.
The time I wore it everything was ok, it just was a little bit annoying, but not too bad.
When I took it off this morning, I was pretty happy to finally be free of it. At least that’s what I thought. 
It turns out, I can still feel it. If I don’t look at my wrist, I think I still have it on me, and when I move my arm, It moves as well.
It is kind of creepy, but _super_ annoying. Like really fucking annoying. I can’t take it off anymore, as I have done this already, and is more annoying than when I actually wore it.

Obligatory didn't happen today, happened last year. 

I work as a community nurse. I had a patient with a wound on his buttock, not far off from his rectum. We were using a vacuum dressing on it, obviously a very hard spot to get a good, air-tight seal. For this reason, we had to use different types of paste, tape, and the area needed to be very dry. To achieve this, we used a blow drier. 

I was chatting away with the patient and his wife while I worked away. The time came for me to dry the area, so I said, ""just going to give you a quick blow job"". 

Thankfully, they pretended not to hear it/ didn't acknowledge it. Cue my face going as red as possible and total embarrassment.

tifu,"So this particular TIFU happened last year when I was working seasonal job during summer at one of the bars on the island.

I was working with 2 of my colleagues which I became a good friend with, they were both my age, around 22 at the time. Let's call one Max and other Simon. You see, Simon wasn't a very bright guy, he would mostly do the job by his own terms and how he likes it instead of listening to the bar manager. Simon was also not very good with English which will come later in this story as well. 

The bar was at the main floor of a small building which had 2 apartments for rent above it, and one apartment in the roof. That's where Max, Simon and I were staying.

Our shift starts at 9 AM till 1 PM, the bar closes since most of the people are at the beach. The bar opens again around 7 PM and our shift for the day ends at 00:00. Since it was a seasonal job, there was a lot of work during the day and you just feel exhausted after workday ... 

So on the day this happened we we're just finishing up our shift and Simon's friend calls him and asks if we wanted to come to a night club which was just down the road. Simon was immediately for it but Max and I were really tired from the work and just wanted to go upstairs to rest, but somehow he managed to get me to go with him. Max went to sleep upstairs.... 

We arrive in front of the nightclub at around 00:30 where Simon introduced me to his couple of friends that were already there... Then a girl approaches Simon. She was around 25-26, I don't really know but a bit older than him. She was dressed in just shorts and some kind of decorated bra/top that would bar girls wear on hot nights. When she approached him, she proceeds to give him a hug and flirty touching him on the arms. Simon wasn't your best looking dude either, I mean as a guy, I'd say he was average, nothing special. This was the first red flag for me... Why would she approach him ? First I thought that she's a club girl, hired to sponsor drinks and stuff so I think nothing of it. From that first interaction with her, Simon gets all aroused and worked up and of course he plans to take her to bed...

I don't know if this was what lead to the fuck up but then I said to him: ""If you manage to fuck that girl, in the next couple of hours, I will give you 100$. If you don't, you're a little bitch and I get 100$ from you. No questions asked."" I mainly said that, because she's working and needs to keep professionalism on point, that she won't indulge herself into that kind of business (so I thought)... He agrees, we shake hands... The Bar girl leaves and Simon and I continue drinking together with his friends...

Around 02:00, I continue to talk with one of the girls from his group, sitting at a harbor, drinking beer, enjoying music... Anyway friend from Simon's group asks me did I see him, I look around and I notice he's gone, I answer that I don't know and continue the casual conversation with this girl...

Around 3:30 the group was leaving to their apartments so I saw no point in staying all together so I went to my apartment as well... As I'm approaching my building, I see Max sitting on the steps in front of it... Yea, the Max that went to sleep when we left for a bar... I ask him ""Dude? Are you ok? Why are you sitting here? I thought you were sleeping?"" he says - ""Yea, I was sleeping, until fucker (Simon) came to my room all like 'Yo Max, Max you need to like, get out of the apartment please. There's a girl here and you know, I wanna bang her. Can you do that?' so at first I was thinking he's bullshitting me but then I heard high heels tapping on the stairs and I got out. I'm sitting here for like 15 minutes and I heard some moans and rumbling upstairs... He's really going at it.""

I was like damn, he got himself a girl, nice... But at the time I haven't even thought of the bet me made and the bar girl...

I told Max to go sit at the tables that were in front of our building and wait for those 2 to finish it up... 

So Max and I chat a bit at the table and 10 minutes pass and here they come... And I have something to see... It's that same girl from the bar ""holy shit, the madman actually did it... fuck"", they say their goodbyes and as he's approaching us at a table I lift my hand up, to give him a fist and I say ""Nice."", he doesn't give it back...

He leans on the chair, head looking down, shit looked like some kind of a drama scene... I ask him ""Dude, what's wrong ?""

He then lifts his head up, looks at us with the most mixed feeling between sad/serious/disappointed and says: ""The girl has a dick!""... My God I was baffled, but at the same time I was laughing in myself and thinking ""How?!""... He continues to tell what happened upstairs but I couldn't but no notice his eyes watering as he was talking....

Simon's story he told us: ""We came upstairs, she immediately started taking my shirt off, asked me if I have coke or weed in the process, I said I don't... She starts giving me a blowjob and I really got into it and started pushing her head even more and more into my crotch and she was doing it and I finish... She then went to the bathroom to clean up and while she was doing that I was removing the rest of my clothes and getting ready for round 2. I hear rumbling in the bathroom and she comes out of it naked... I fucked her then from behind, but dude I didn't notice anything! She then pushed me onto the bed and... I was looking at her crotch... and I noticed like, she has a dick! I said like 'What the fuck!? You have a dick?!' and she just made the 'Shhhhh' move.. I pushed her, she fell onto the kitchen counter and told her to get out... It was like a tiny dick, I don't even know what it was..."" 

The whole time as he was saying us that, I couldn't help myself but every time he said ""She"", I just thought to myself ""No man, it's 'He'"", and laugh a bit...

Max and I are just sitting outside with him, thinking what we've just heard, 04:00 AM, work tomorrow morning and we just wanna go upstairs to sleep... 

""Don't go upstairs"", Simon says, we ask him ""Why the fuck not ? It's 4 AM and we're working in the morning dude""

He says: ""She shitted......(long pause)............ all over the shower...."" My face went instantly 'dafuck-did-I-just hear' mode... I tried making some sense of it, I guess, and make him feel better about it by saying ""Ah, it's not that hard, just pick it up with some toilet paper and we're good to go"". But no, of course it had to be more to that. ""She shitted all over the fucking shower, dude. Not just in one piece, diarrhea like, all over the fucking shower"" (For shower we had just the bottom pan, surrounded with a curtain). To make the stuff even better, the drainage was slow as hell from all of the build up..

I just didn't know what to say.... Max said ""Let's just all go upstairs and we'll see what can we fix"".... 

When we came upstairs, you could just smell it from the moment you enter the apartment... Max and I both said ""Dude, we're sorry but, you fucked, you clean after yourself"" with a lot of laughing in between... 

Simon takes cleaning stuff and and proceeds to enter a now contaminated area, which we call bathroom. He immediately starts gagging, I mean who wouldn't hah... I needed to take a piss so hard but since I can't fall asleep if there's even a bit of liquid in my bladder, so I wrap a t-shirt around my face, and then another one... I enter the bathroom, with my eyes closed, not trying to look at the brown swamp she/he made, that's all just STAYING there, not draining away because we're too lazy to removed the drain blockage. The smell just penetrates my well-improvised survival gear and heads straight for my nasal glands. Oh the smell...I knew I had to get out of there ASAP. I do the deed as fast as I can, shake the little guy up, and head straight outside before I receive a fatal dose of radiation from that contaminated leakage... As he's cleaning the mess, I fall asleep.

Later tomorrow he say's the rest of the story, how when she first approached him, she whispered to his ear ""You're cute."" And when I came with the 100$ dollar bet and said if he doesn't do it he's a bitch... He then realized he just has to get her to bed and it's on, he ain't backing out... 

We've asked him multiple times how he, for crying out loud, didn't notice the penis in between her/his legs, and is he sure that he put his schlong into the right hole... He just became frustrated and said he doesn't know.. After he said to me: ""Dude, why the fuck did you made that bet ?! Why ? I wouldn't even go after her before that point. She wasn't even that hot..."" I didn't know what to say and just shrugged and said that now we know he's not a little bitch.. 

I give him 100$, he shows absolutely no interest in it... I tried to make a joke to cheer him up, ""At least she/he didn't fuck you"", he just looked and me and told me to fuck off but I couldn't help myself but to laugh heh...

About a week later, when I was at the dinner with my brother, (who also worked seasonal job there but at a hotel), and his friend, we told that friend the story... We still didn't know why did she/he do that in the shower, it makes no sense at all... See, we didn't have the shower head attachment, just the hose.. And then the friend told us: ""You wanna know why was your shower full of that ? Because she/he put the hose up her bum, and proceeded to give herself/himself an enema"" (For those of you that don't know what enema is, it's a medical procedure where liquid is injected into ones bowels trough rectum to get rid of all the build up inside. Commonly used before you go into bum action with your partner)... Our reaction wasn't really disgust, we were more like ""Ooooooooh that's why""

The following days, Simon decided to stay working behind the bar, inside, in fear of meeting her/him again outside while serving... 

   
 

TL;DR: Went to a night bar with a friend, made a 100$ bet he can't fuck a girl, he did, turns out the girl had a penis, she/he left a brown liquid mess in our bathroom after doing medical procedure on herself, lost 100$",TIFU by losing 100$ and sexually scarring my friend for life
tifu,"I had a post on a vaccination page blow up. It has thousands of upvotes. At first there weren’t many terrible comments but as it progressed it got worse. It got to r/all and shit hit the fan quick. There were so many comments about what was posted that I couldn’t keep up. Some were repetitive and it was entirely too toxic. This post made people fight back and forth between something that shouldn’t be fought about. I had multiple anti vaxx people pm me and send me bs videos. It was a giant cesspool of hate from both sides of a spectrum. If you’ve seen or not, it depends but I can’t even bear the comment section anymore. I posted it to a sub where it fits and people were still complaining. So in the end the arguments were worthless and I had to sift though people’s opinions for hours while my inbox begged for mercy.

tifu,"This actually happened a year ago, but figured was worth posting as one of my most memorable fuck ups that I can recall. So my furry nugget named Forest (believe it or not I did not name him because of the movie, he was a dumpster cat at the restaurant I used to work at called The Forest at Cape Fear National) was dealing with fleas and the vet prescribed him a topical medication to treat it. For those who don’t know, a topical medication is just a medication that is applied to a particular place on or in the body, in this case being an ointment that was to be applied to the back of his neck so he would be unable to lick it.

Anyways, I always pet my dog and my cat on the head on my way out the door and as embarrassing as it is to admit this, I always blow them a kiss goodbye.

tifu,"Honestly this is more of 'I've been continuously fucking up for years' type thing, but I just found this out now.

I'm from Europe so I've been to France quite a lot of times and learnt all about WW2 in school.

But it wasn't until reddit that I started hearing about Omaha beach all the time when talking about WW2, at first I didn't even realise it was in France as if you've ever been to France it really does not sound like a French place.

I quickly become intrigued and fascinated by this French beach with such a quirky and unique sounding name and always thought it was such a strange name for a place in France.

That was until a few minutes ago, when after seeing its name again I decided to research its curious origins. Only to discover that there is no Omaha beach and it was merely a codename used by the US military to describe part of Normandy.

The way people referred to Omaha beach I thought it was an actual place, feel like I've been duped.

tifu,"You ever see those bums standing on street corners of populated metro areas who try forcing their absolutely atrocious hip hop CD's into innocent civilians hands? Well, let's just say there's a reason everyone ignores them so heavily. I was visiting Portland Oregon a few days ago for business purposes and had just gotten off of a MAX train, it was around 8 PM and I was pretty uncomfortable if I'm being honest since I wasn't in a fantastic area and didn't happen to have any self defense weapons on my person (Self defense weapons being something that I really fucking need considering my figure is almost an invitation for some asshole to donkey punch me and then steal my wallet).

As I made my way down a stairway exit that directed me towards the city, one of my phone alarms went off quite loudly in the pocket of my shitty Goodwill rain jacket. *Fuck*, I needed to get to my meeting in the next 25 minutes or else I'd be scum on the bottom of my bosses overly expensive yet at the same time useless dress shoes. So I continued on, walking through a downpour of rain as it's scent blended with the pollution of a busy metro area. This is where the story gets uh... ""Good"" (Good for you to read as someone looking to be entertained, embarrassing and shitty for me). After walking down a busy sidewalk located next to a few major establishments for a couple of minutes, a young african american male of maybe 23 years of age standing outside of a shopping mall caught my eye.

He was by himself and was standing next to a garbage bag that appeared to be full of... I don't even know it was full of something. He was holding a bunch of what looked like CD cases and attempting to pass them out to passerby's. To no one's surprise, it didn't look as if he was having much success. Now I didn't have to time to assess this situation further, I had maybe 10 minutes to get to my meeting or else I was up shits creek, but something about this young man intrigued me. I myself as an artist (Shit that's what the meeting I was heading to was regarding) remember pedaling my content to anyone I could, mostly people who weren't interested in it and who were just trying to mind their own business. So for *whatever fucking reason* I had come up with in my head at the time, I decided it'd be a good idea to approach this young man and take one of his CD's assuming they were free. I'd give him a chance; something everyone deserves. Just because someone is poor and at rock bottom doesn't mean they aren't making good music, hell the best music from an artist is usually from when they were suffering.

So I walk up to the young man and put my hand out with a gesture insinuating that I would be more than obliged to take one of his *free* CD samples. He plopped one of his CD's rudely into my hand without saying a word, and my god do I wish I had taken a picture of that CD's cover. It was probably one of the most disgusting album covers I had ever seen in my entire life, it showcased a very poorly drawn picture of himself standing in front of a poorly drawn lambo and... On top of the Lambo was a poorly drawn completely naked woman with ejaculate dripping from her vagina. The young man then said some literal gibberish before holding his hand out in silence. It took me a few seconds to realize that he wanted a money donation for his ""gift"" to me.

I stood there for a few seconds in silence before saying ""Aw nah man I don't have any money on me but I'll definitely check this out and get back to you"" (At this point that wasn't true at all I just wanted to get out of there in one piece ASAP). The young man then wore a very stern and angry looking face before I turned around and made my way to my meeting once again all while keeping a fast pace to get the fuck away from that guy fast. Well after about 20 seconds of walking I get approached by another street musician (A man of maybe 40 years of age). He's missing most of his teeth and I can't understand a fuckin' gargle that comes out of his mouth as he tries forcing his shitty CD (That didn't even have a case) into my hands (Keep in mind he was standing in front of me). That's when all of the sudden I get pushed from behind with extreme force and fall face first into a giant ass puddle that drenches my entire body with disgusting fucking city rain water. I pull myself up from the puddle and turn around to see it was the young man from before, he picks up the CD he gave me that I had dropped on the sidewalk after being Mortal Kombat Fatality'd into a fucking puddle before running off in the opposite direction and mumbling slurs at me with 0 enunciation in his words so I didn't understand a lick of what he said. That's when I noticed he had a tattoo on the back of his (Bald) head of a pair of lips, so that's awesome.

Anyway, I did make it to my meeting but my ass and legs were completely soaking wet in disgusting smelling city rain water and it looked like I had just gotten done performing a 12 hour watersports session in the sewer with a band of hobos. My coworkers were not impressed and I was pretty ashamed of myself for allowing this wet disaster to occur in the first place.. Do NOT accept Cd's from these bums ever, no matter what (Even if that was obvious knowledge).

Oh and if that bum is SOMEHOW reading this (Assuming he can read). I hope you get arrested for something soon and then get your buttcheeks passed around in your cell like a joint.

TL;DR I gave a hobo an artistic chance by accepting his CD and it ended up being a trap for money, I was then assaulted and drenched in shit water and had to go to a meeting in those same clothes.

tifu,"So last night I was just sittin in my living room playing some Warframe and having a good ol’ time. When all of a sudden, what sounded like two magnums being unloaded started going off in my neighbor’s yard direction. 

For a little backstory about these folks, there was an incident a few months back where I had just got home and five policemen, with their weapons drawn, were surrounding their house along with a helicopter circling overhead. So I just noped the fuck into my house, got into my room and nervously waited for something to go down. Luckily no shots were fired that day, but since then I’ve had a really uneasy feeling about the house. 

So with that context in mind, as soon as I thought I heard gunfire my mind instantly remembered that moment, and I thought to myself “ah fuck, someone over-there finally snapped.” My younger sister and I were the only one’s in the house at the time since my parents were on their date night, and I was especially worried because her room is closest to the neighbors house with a big window pointing towards them. So I immediately dropped to the floor and army crawled my way to her room. 

Halfway there I start screaming “GET THE FUCK DOWN, LAY ON THE FLOOR, GET THE FUCK DOWN.” I make it to my sisters room, and see that shes just casually chillin on her laptop as this is going on, and I just yell out “WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, GET DOWN, THE NEIGHBORS ARE HAVING A GUN FIGHT.” And my sister says “Arn’t those fireworks?” My angry and confused ass just goes” NO YOU IDIOT. WHY WOULD THERE BE FIREWORKS GOING OFF RIGHT NOW. NOW GET THE FUCK DOWN SO U DONT GET SHOT.” 

So my sister drops to the ground and we crawled into the middle of the hallway. I then immediately called 911. When they answered I frantically told them my address and told them that I thought my neighbors were having a shoot out. I gave them my number and they sent out a dispatch immediately to check it out. 

In the mean time, I told my sister to crawl to my room since it was the furthest away from the neighbors house incase any stray bullets were to make it into our house. At this point my brain is in full panic mode, and the whole situation felt extremely surreal. I kept thinking to myself this isn’t how I want to die and began thinking of any possible situation we could prevent. So as soon as we got to my room I told my sister to hide in my closet and if anyone came in to not make a single noise. I thought the next logical thing for the shooters were to kill any potential witness (panic makes you think weird things), so i started barricading my door with any box and chair i could find in case and tried to hide behind my bed as still as possible. 

A few moments later the shots have stopped firing. I felt an impending doom that I could be fighting for my life in the next few minutes. 8 minutes later, I get a call from the dispatched officer, and he tells me the gunfire I heard was actually a fireworks show from the high school across the street for their graduation ceremony and that there’s nothing to worry about. My face turned red with embarrassment, and I apologized profusely for calling and thanked him for checking it out anyways.  I let my sister out of the closet and when she heard that it was just fireworks I was served a very heavy dose of “I told ya so.”

TL;DR I thought the neighbors were having a shoot out. Called the police on them. Hid my sister like we were in 1942 Germany all because of the high-school graduation ceremony fireworks show right next door.",TIFU by thinking the fireworks show outside my house was my neighbors having a shootout.
tifu,"So, I volunteer for Meals in Wheels and I really love delivering food to seniors. All the seniors are really nice and they brighten my day. I schedule my work around this because I think it's such an important task. These seniors eat a healthy meal (or eat at all) because of this program.  

So last week I accidentally scheduled a swimming lesson at the same time and I realized this until today. Either way, I chose to deliver the meals instead of giving the lesson. I tried to re schedule, but they couldn’t do it today. In all fairness, I thought I was getting paid for some other work today (though I also knew there as a chance I was not)

So now I’m broke and with an overdraft fee. I think I would have felt worse if I failed the seniors. I guess my heart feels good but my brain is telling me “Are you stupid?” Either way, I feel really stupid... 

I guess money will come either way afterwards. But I will definitely be 100 times more careful with my schedule.

TL;DR  I chose to do volunteer work instead of paid work causing to over draft my account.",TIFU by choosing to deliver meals to seniors instead of giving a swimming lesson that could have saved me from over drafting my account.
tifu,"So before we start, I (male) live in Asia, where most parents does not know English and they think facebook is internet. My Dad never knew porn exist and does not know that porn is normal. Also, I am not allowed to bring my phone into the bathroom, because when I was younger I used to stay in there for hours (over exaggeration) and they thought I was playing games (I was masturbating). I am now in college but lives with my parents and grand parents because we live in the capital and the uni is not that far.

This happens a month ago in the evening . I am in my room and decided to masturbate. I can lock my room, but my parent have the keys to it and use it regularly, because they are ASIAN. I locked my room, went to the bathroom in my room and started to do my thing.
A few minutes in I hear rattle from the door knob, meaning my parent must be trying to get in, so I decreased the volume, the rattle stops meaning they must be heading to get the key, which is not that far. During that time, my aunt called and I thought I was being smart by tossing my phone out on to the table, so that my dad would answer it when he gets in. The door opens and I let the sound of the shower drown inside, my dad said something but I ignored it and can use the excuse that I was in the shower, when they ask me why I didn’t answer.

After shower, I came out to find the video I was watching was still playing. I thought to myself, maybe my Dad came in, saw my aunt calling and tried to tell me and left, or that he saw the porn and said something about it, that I ignored. Later at night, before bed, my Dad entered and lectured me about PROSTITUTE, about how I have to use protection and how he never saw me using my money and asking me have I been using them on prostitute ( it was on games ). I thought the cringe ness ends there, but a few days later he came in again talking about the same thing, but in more detail before the first one was really short, he must have felt really cringey too. And just afew hours earlier, again but this time he tried to be a sneak sneak by coming in normally, and asked me some questions about facebook about how to share a post into our family group chat. He then asked for my phone to check if it’s there. I was playing games,  so I didn’t think and just give. After finishing my game I checked my phone and I double click the home button and messenger was never opened. It was safari.

TL;DR : Masturbate in the bathroom -&gt; Dad tried to come in through locked door -&gt; Aunt called during the session -&gt; toss phone out on to table -&gt; Dad comes in with key, saw porn on my phone and is now lecturing me about prostitutes and using protection.","TIFU by leaving porn on on my phone, and Dad found out"
tifu,"First things first, this is my first TIFU, so I am really sorry if I did something wrong.

Last week some relatives came to our house, they were my Aunt, my grandmother and my two cousins.

So My grandmother has a mobile phone (You know, a plain cellphone like the ones before the smartphone era), I was bored sitting on the couch alone so I decided to check the phone, after I looked at things like numbers, messages etc, I opened the browser in it, its just a simple browser, you can't play videos in it but you can look at pictures, I decided to check the settings and looked at the history, and holy moly would you look at that, all I saw was **C Class NSFW google searches** like ""boob"", ""boobs touch"", ""boob massage"", ""girl naked without dress"" etc. 

(At this point I have to say that English isn't our native language, and my aunt and grandmother don't know english, so it must be one of my cousins)

But the thing is, the history was so long that you could see the things they &lt;mmm jacked off?&gt; to almost an year ago, so I decided to clear it all and leave them a message in history by googling ""Always Clear"" and ""Browsing History"" (at this point my older sister walks in and notices me using grandmas phone) and then when I checked history again I saw this:

Today
=======
Always Clear
Browsing History


It all looks good. 



&lt;insert 2 Hours Later from Spongebob&gt;



And there I was checking the history again and what I saw was more ""boobs"" stuffs and an amusing ""girl sex with girl"" searches just above my message, I thought maybe who ever searched it didn't know about browsing history, so I decided to leave my message in a way they could find by changing homepage to ""DELETE YOUR BROWSING HISTORY"". (At this point both my sister and my older cousin walks by and they both saw me using grandma's phone, you can already guess where this is going).

So here is the fuck up, I am woken up by an angry mother who says the others want to see me, I went to the table where the others (my older sis, older cousin, granny and aunt) were sitting, They all had an angry face so it didn't take me a second to understand what happened, they said ""they were disappointed and disgusted at me for shamelessly looking at bad things on my grandmother's phone on the couch"" but before I could open my mouth, my bratty sis opened her's saying that someone tried to warn me by leaving messages but didn't clear the history instead so the searches were still there and they were about women (boobs, girl with girl etc) and that it could only be ME cuz I was the only guy there.

Again before I could say anything, I noticed my younger cousin standing in the dimly lit kitchen next to me, there was guilt and sadness in her face, she looked at me and slightly nodded as if she don't mind me telling on her, but I turned my face to my relatives and my mother, I sighed and said that I was sorry and that I would never do such a thing again, in the end they gave me a lecture for an hour which ended in 12 am, after all the madness my younger cousin came to my room and she cried and apologized for everything, she said that she was a lesbian and that she didn't think there would be browsing history on that phone, she said she was glad and was grateful that I didn't tell on her. (she said that she only likes girls, but I said that it was probably a growing phase and she could change)

I froze, by bro and I kept looking back and forth between each and my husband. After what seemed like forever (probably 10 secs) I'm able to muster ""it's not what it seems"".

tifu,"Obligatory, new to reddit. Mobile. I say bad English is my first language so feel free to tell me how I fucked up my native language too. Did happen today though! 

For a little background, a few weeks back my boyfriend and I had a small party with close friends. The morning after the party I was out on the deck taking a bong hit (weed is legal where I live). As I look over to the other house across the street I see some men in the yard throwing grey dust into the yard. 
My first thought was they were spreading ashes in a very odd manner. Now I don't know why this was my first thought, but after a moment I realized that it was grass seed and had a good chuckle to myself. I go inside and tell my bf &amp; friends about my weird thoughts and they laugh at my stupidity. 
Fast forward 15 minutes and breakfast is finished and the group comes outside to the deck, where the other girl and myself take another hit. Que the neighbours turning on the sprinklers to water their grass. My friend attempting to make a joke exclaims ""Oh look Coca, they are watering grandma!""

Now I am the first to admit my humour is off beat and pretty dark, I also am pretty fast on my feet. So without thinking I respond. ""I mean, would it be to far to say you gotta make grandma wet one last time?"" I don't know, we thought it was all pretty far, but made for a good belly laugh. 


Fast forward to today. I work for a chain grocery store which is open 24/7 at my location. I was working the ""closing shift"" which ended at 11pm.
It was roughly 10:30pm, the store has a few wandering in the isles, but overall pretty slow. I have a lady roughly 25 come to my till. We are chatting and I make a sfw joke but leaning towards my edgy dark humour. She gets a good kick out of it.

I tell her that if she taught that was funny she should hear my nsfw jokes. She is interested so I give a small tldr version making sure no one can hear it.

Well what I didn't realize was that an old woman also got in my line and was listening. So I'm half way through my joke, telling her about seeing the 'ash' and saying it was grandma. When I turn and see this women.

NOW. I know the smart thing
to do would have been to stop and say oh there is another customer but if you are willing to wait until after her transaction I can tell you the rest.
I didn't... I just kinda turned away from the older lady and continued... I kinda fumbled the punch line to downplay it... The younger lady is laughing so hard she is bent over. She loved it, needless to say, the old lady was just looking at me with saucers for eyes.

To try and get the older lady to understand I give a light chuckle and say
""I know I'm an awful person. I'm not proud of what I said. But it made for a good dark joke"" the older woman still did not look happy but not baffled anymore either. So I turned my full attention back to the younger women and say,
""So, I know I'm an awful person for saying it, but I'm just saying that you laughed so you're just as bad!"" We both laughed and agreed we'd see each other in hell and she left.

Didn't end badly (yet, I may get a customer review online) but still the old lady did not seem amused

2, I've been living with my roommate for almost ten years now, and in times past were avid friends with benefits. This hasn't been the case for awhile now and I'm too shy and self conscious and out of shape to go looking for anything.

So now to the story at hand, pretty straight forward I suppose.

My roommate and I were spending the night in watching movies and drinking together when she offers to cut my hair for me (something we've been doing to save me money since we aren't super well off). Well after she finished I jumped in the shower to clean off, and this is where the fuck up begins. Now I always have this nagging feeling that it would reeeeally suck if I were to take care of my needs in the shower and then be propositioned after for the first time in a long time. Can you see where this is going? Sure enough another 15 minutes later she comes by my room and in a very embarrassed and exasperated way asks me if I can help her as she can't seem to finish the job herself.

Just last week it was my birthday and I had a cabin trip with a bunch of friends, while we were there my friend lets call him Tony dared me to eat a Ghost Pepper with him.

We ate it while it was recording, I bit my ghost pepper but for the most part swallowed it whole (fuck up #1) my other two friends freaked out after 10 seconds and were frantically running around, I was calm and stayed there. Then my friend who was recording dared me to have another since I didn't really have a reaction, I decided to (fuck up #2) I swallowed the second one and no other reaction came from it. We start walking along a path and I don't think anything of it, but then my stomach starts flaring up, its a bit painful but I keep walking. We decide to head back and I eat a full dinner (final fuck up) and on top of that since it was my birthday I just ate shitty all around. Half an hour later I had to go to the bathroom. I was on the toilet for 20 minutes but nothing came out, my stomach was burning uncontrollably at this point. The pain was so immense I thought I may have had to go to the hospital. I decided to tough it out, The pain was so excruciating that I puked everything out. It only helped for a little while, I laid on the floor teary eyed just feeling the horrific burn go through my stomach, after I felt ""ok"" I laid on the couch for an hour to recover.

So I get a lot of these bots messaging me. They message and usually ask for nudes or something and I also decline it. Today, well today I was bored so I responded saying hi, they did their usual “how are you” then got straight to the meat of why they were there. Nudes. Being the bored person I was I started just sending them pictures of creepy things. Abandoned buildings that looked creepy, blood spattered walls. 

Side note I don’t usually have this stuff on my phone I just grabbed it off of reddit as I went along.

I just started sending him pictures over and over again. Getting more and more graphic as I went along. Don’t judge me I was bored and honestly if someone is just messaging someone for nudes they deserve it. Plus it was more than likely a bot. Got to the point I started sending NSFL stuff, limbs missing, heads blown apart etc. 

It got to a point where he just started trying to call me over and over and over again on Instagram to the point it froze my phone up. I had to disable my Instagram while I wait for this to blow over and hope he gives up soon. Every-time I try to get back into it it just starts again over and over.

tifu,"This actually happened today and I still feel terrible.

So I'm a nurse at a hospital in the netherlands and recently I was transferred to a different floor, so I have a lot of new colleagues that I don't really know yet. 

Today was a busy day and when it was finally break time we were very glad to be able to sit for a few minutes. One of my colleagues was blowing off some steam by telling about one of her patients who had been quite annoying. While telling this, she was making funny noises with her mouth/nose and I thought maybe her patient talked in a weird way and that she was mocking him or something. So I started laughing. After a few seconds I realised that none of my other colleagues were laughing and they all started looking weird at me. She stopped talking and asked me why I was laughing. Before I  could answer she explained that sometimes she has some kind of tic/stutter and that she can't do anything about it. I immediately turned red and apologised multiple times. She laughed it off but I still felt really bad and couldn't really look at her for the rest of the night.

Backstory: I’m an absolute fiend for Coke Zero. Ex Diet Coke fan, but fully converted and regular worshipper at the cathedral of the cans. I love the stuff.. I tend to have a lot of old cans which pile up around me at any given time, and I’m not immune to using them as tiny bins. Hope you can see where this is going.

Anyway last week we were gearing up to go on holiday, packing bags etc and me and my girlfriend end up having sex shortly before we go. We live with her mum while we finish saving up for our deposit, so rather than use the normal bin, I use a can on the side to deposit the now used prophylactic. Rather it goes unseen if possible...

Queue our holiday away - everyone has a great time at a friends wedding in the sun. Couldn’t have been more spectacular. So we return home a week and a bit later. Early hours flight. What am I craving? You guessed it! Grabbed a can of Coke from my stash and proceeded to unwind in bed. 

So all is good in the world when I pick up my can and take a sip and realise it doesn’t quite taste right. Oops there’s two cans there - this must be an old one. My brain didn’t quite twig at this point. Tried it again thought it tastes funny - must go really weird when left out for a week...still not quite clicked. I let it lie a little longer before deciding to chuck it out before I drank any more by accident.

So I walk to the bathroom sink, start to tip away the excess and guess what with a little persuasion comes out of the can. Yes you guessed it, my little old used condom...yum yum.

Little backstory, my boyfriend works outside so sometimes he can get pretty sweaty around his nether regions. Baby powder usually helps this issue.

The other night I had taken a shower and was feeling a bit frisky afterwards, so I told my boyfriend to come hither (little finger waggle and all) so I could pleasure him a bit first, get things going.  I start doing my thing, taking it slow, building it up. We both were super into it, our sex brains were fully in control too,

I make it down to his penis and in half a second of getting down to business I push myself back from him coughing and hacking tasting NOTHING but baby powder. And in that particular moment he remembers that he did in fact use some baby powder today through his crying/laughing fit. 

Not incredibly terrible, but we both got a good kick out of it!

tifu,"My fiancé and I broke up about a month ago, but have been living together until last week, when our lease was up. We had been together 7 years. and I have a daughter who’s soon to be 8. If you do the math, my ex has been there since my daughter learned to walk. So, my daughter’s emotional health regarding the breakup has been a real concern for both of us. 

Today, I went to work and She offered to watch my daughter so they could spend time together, and of course, to help me by not needing to hire a babysitter (didn’t want you to think I overlooked that aspect).  

Anyways, I’m at work, hoping they’re having a good time together at home, and I get a text from her, which says:
I can’t believe you would be so insensitive as to leave a used condom in your trash can, knowing I would be over here!!
I went against my better judgment coming here, and helping you. Seeing this was like a punch in the gut! 

My heart sank. I really still care about her (we
just couldn’t make it work) and I did take the trash out in the kitchen, and in the other bathroom. I cleaned out all the empty White Claw cans. I  washed the sheets. I really tried to not let her see anything. Of course, how I spaced on the bathroom trash, I have no idea. 

So, she was really hurt, and I feel awful. I sincerely apologized, then She left as soon as I got home from work.  I’m guessing it’ll be a while before we speak again.  Luckily, when my daughter FaceTimes her, I know she’ll answer. 

I’m writing this mostly as therapy, but also to get some honest opinions: 

How much of an asshole am I?
Should I do anything (I’ve already sincerely apologized), or just let time do it’s thing?

This has happened over the past few months, and is coming to a head. I get paid half of what my peers make. Not enough to make rent each month. That doesn’t excuse what I did.

For the past few months, I’ve been putting in my time as if I’ve been working later than I have. I drive a company vehicle and they have gps on me, so they have records saying I got home earlier than I said I did. Basically I was dumb and hoped it wouldn’t get noticed since my pay is so small. “Everyone does it” isn’t a good excuse because the guys who do don’t get flagged for it.

Anyway, onto the fuckup. My boss comes in saying she does not have my number yet since this first week we have just been going over my roles at work and so forth. Lots of prep stuff and showing me what I will be doing. So she mentions that she hadn’t given me her number yesterday for whatever reason could come up that I might need to contact her if she’s not in her office.

My brain was on autopilot so after helping her I went through a moment of “what was I doing? Oh yeah” and put the paint can I was holding into the mixer. 

Immediately I hear metal-on-metal clanking and it dawns on me: I didn’t hammer the lid shut and god know how many RPM sent every ounce of the can flying.

Now, workers have neglected to fully hammer the lid shut leading little incidents, so I asked my coworker if anything of this magnitude has ever happened looking for some guidance on getting this cleaned up. My hopes were shot down. We brainstorm a bit trying to figure out a way out of this and I eventually spend an hour and a half cleaning so the area looks... not terrible. I had a bit of a laugh about it with the manager earlier and everything seems like it’ll work out, right? Then, I asked myself: “Will the machine even work?” I do a little test run and it   spins, but clearly slower and with a squelching sound.  And this is only with wet paint. 

Now I’m panicking and find out the manager had to leave early and the supervisor is definitely in bed preparing to open in the morning. I can’t reach anywhere near all the parts to clean them and no one left in the store can be expected to know how to rectify the situation (We’ve closed 45 minutes ago by now). 

A more experienced worker thinks the mixer won’t end up unusable but I’m not completely sure. I’m at home currently, hoping for the best.

tifu,"This happened about ten years ago.

I found out through the grapevine that one of my friends had just announced they were three months pregnant with their first child. They'd been trying for over a year so their success was great news and obvious cause for celebration.

I waited about a week, called my pregnant friend up and enthusiastically hollered into the phone, ""Hey!!! Congratulations on getting knocked up! I'm so happy for the both of you!""

Dead silence.

After an awkward pause, all she said was, ""Yeah, I miscarried today... we found out about an hour ago.""

tifu,"When I was in the second semester of my freshman year of college I was spending most of my time with a very rowdy kid from Siberia, and we were making a lot of bad decisions. One Friday afternoon he showed up unexpectedly at my dorm room, proudly holding a sandwich bag containing 12 Xanax bars. Being 18 and stupid, I was down to take them almost immediately, and we went back to his dorm to partake. We spent the rest of that day in a stupor, hanging out with his pet mouse, Yama, who was pushing 4 years old at that point and was visibly old and unwell. I remember putting him back in his cage, feeding him, and watching him make a sad, tired attempt to run on his wheel for a few minutes. 

At some point after that we blacked out, and we both passed out in his room some time in the late evening. Early the next day I woke up on my friend’s super small couch to him sitting about 3 inches away from my face, whispering, “hey, dude, I think Yama had a heart attack.” I got up and walked over to the cage, and found the poor old bastard at the foot of his wheel, 1000% dead. My friend cried in silence for a while, and I just kind of sat there watching, until suddenly he looked up at me and said, “we have to honor him.” I had a breakfast date that morning, and he was so barred out I honestly thought he may have still been blacked out when he said that, so I didn’t think much of it and left around 9:30. Two hours later I returned, because we had plans to get alcohol from some senior, only to find his room in shambles and him sitting on the ground, Xanax spread all over the floor, in the process of finishing an elaborate ship-like vessel made out of an iPhone case that he had stuffed with some of the bedding from Yama’s cage, inside of which he had placed Yama’s body, along with a cocktail sword and a small metal button Yama used to play with. He looked up at me and said in such a serious tone, “we’re giving him a Viking funeral.” Once again, being 18 and stupid, I was immediately down. It sounded cool, I wanted to honor Yama, and the timing seemed perfect, because we could get it done in half an hour and walk straight over to the bus stop across the street from where we planned on interring him. With the decision made and the materials ready, we both took more Xanax and set out on our mission.
We took Yama and his funeral boat, along with some flowers and a bottle of lighter fluid, to a little pond on campus that was just behind the building that he lived in at the time. I made a speech, he said some Russian prayers, and we put flowers on the ground near the pond for him- it was beautiful. After all of the ceremony was concluded, my friend poured lighter fluid over Yama and his boat, and we got ready to send our departed friend to Valhalla. I figured that we would be lighting the pyre once the boat had been placed in the water, but my friend had other ideas. He placed it on the ground and dropped a match on it while we were still 20 feet from the pond. At this point, things went sour fast. 

In his Xanax induced haze, he had somehow managed to not stuff the iPhone box entirely with Yama’s bedding. Instead, he only put in enough to fill the top half of it, leaving half of the box completely empty, which allowed most of the the lighter fluid to pool at bottom. About 5 seconds after he dropped that match, the box basically exploded and sent flaming cardboard and small pet bedding material about 6-10 feet in every direction. The fire from all of this debris set a decent sized patch of grass ablaze, and it seriously looked like we had genuinely fucked up and started a bad fire. My friend, being a dumbass, immediately responds by yelling “run,” but somehow in the heat of the moment I was able to stop him from leaving (usually he would’ve just bailed). He starts dumping a water bottle he had all over bits of the flaming debris, successfully putting out much of the fire, but failing to do anything to the large patch of flaming grass near where the remains of the box itself were burning. At this point real panic had set in, the fire was getting way too big, and to top it off, I could see the bus we had to take coming around the corner. In a moment of pure adrenaline, I took off the coat I was wearing and tossed it over the flames. This managed to smother the fire, I put the coat back on, and my friend and I both ran over to the bus stop and just managed to catch the bus we needed to take to get our alcohol.

The whole time I was in that bus, I was overwhelmed by this horrible, sickeningly sweet-ish meaty smell that I can only assume was roasted Yama. We spent most of the ride in silence, until about 10 minutes in, when my friend turned to me and said, “wow, that was pretty bad.” It was. The smell is still clinging to that coat 5 years later. My friend didn’t graduate with me.

So me and the GF of almost a year are doing a semi-long distance relationship. Nothing crazy, just a few hours of driving between the two of us and we are doing pretty good at making it work so far. Today, she told me her head was hurting at work and Ibuprofen wasn't doing anything so she took the rest of the day off to sleep it off. When she got back home she asked me to FaceTime her for a bit before she passes out which was a really cute thing to do before I fucked it up. So we talk normally for a few minutes just catching up before she is slowly starting to fall asleep. Me, being the moron I am, thought it would be funny to make really dumb, progressively more extreme faces while my GF drifts in and out of consciousness. At one point I am trying to do the ugliest duck face I can and end up with something like [this](https://www.askideas.com/media/36/Guy-Funny-Weird-Duck-Face.jpg). At this exact moment the GF wakes up and screams out loud and throws her phone off the bed. I immediately stop the face and try to apologize to her but I could hear her start crying. So here I am staring at her ceiling fan on the floor while I hear her sniffles and cries on the bed and I feel like a huge jackass. I keep trying to say sorry but after like 30 seconds or so she picks up the phone and just hangs up.

It was a good laugh to see people’s reactions, and have them eventually disconnect when they find out that I’m an actual human.

I decided to push it further; I invented a whole backstory about the events which lead to the creation of the bot, I invented a fake university where the AI was made, and I even opened a fake GitHub page for the source code.

Have you heard of Poe’s Law? Any joke on the internet will always get taken seriously by at least one person.

I got matched up with a stranger who seemed... very interested in the AI. I talked to them about existential questions and what consciousness really means while pretending to be some kind of hyper intelligent computer program all along. After 45 minutes, I was quickly starting to realize that this person thought I was actually real. I stopped the conversation, saying that interactions are limited to 100 messages to prevent spambots from corrupting the machine learning process.

I thought it was over. But I was wrong.

I then got a private message from them saying that they want to meet the bot again. I responded to them, pretending to be the lead developer this time around. After getting some praise about how complex the AI was, I gave them one of my actual email addresses and went to bed.

This morning, I got a very serious email from them about how they are really interested in this bot. They are asking why they could not find anything on the Internet about the AI, something which I could easily answer by saying that it was just a student project, and they are also asking when they can talk to the bot again.

This person really seems motivated from some dumb robot roleplay I put together at 10 PM which ended being just a little too convincing.

Should I just tell them the truth, despite of how disappointed they will be? Should I just never answer back? Should I try continuing the act?

They paid really well, and there was overtime almost every day (mostly a negative for me though). I thought I was doing pretty good, but my boss told me I needed to get more motivated and do things faster otherwise I would not be there the whole summer. I took it way too personally and decided to immediately look for a new job thinking I would lose the job. The other job I almost took before I got the HVAC job was in a warehouse. I called them up and asked for a job, which they gladly gave me. Then I called my boss at the HVAC job to tell him I was leaving. He told me he had no intention of firing me, and that he just wanted me to work a little faster. I then started to have second thoughts but decided to commit to the warehouse job. 

So I get to the new job in the warehouse and the environment sucks.  The guy training me made no sense, and the warehouse was literally like 90 degrees. I felt like I was in a sad, depressed, sweatshop. Half way through the day I was like fuck this, I would like working back at my old job so much more. I became increasing swayed to calling up my old boss and asking to come back. And I eventually asked to go to the bathroom to call him and ask if I could come back. He laughed, but gladly wanted me to come back to the company. Then I had to awkwardly quit the job I had just started like 4 hours into it.

Several of my classmates in math are also in a small AP (Advanced Placement) class called Seminar, which is kind of like a research and presentation based, alternative advanced English class for sophomores in American high schools. 

Long story short, we started messing around in the group chat by spamming things and sending memes, as we had the final next block, and we were just trying to lift the moods of our classmates. Those who had free time in their current classes were participating and those who were busy weren’t. No one was being hurt. 

That was until I heard the girl behind me, who is also in my Seminar class sigh, “Thomas...”, and I looked over at Thomas, another Seminar classmate, who was smiling. I looked in the group chat and he had copy and pasted the entire Chipotle menu in the chat. This quickly led to people sending things like the entire Bee Movie script, rules of Jahism (take a guess) and long copy and pasted paragraphs about why smoking crack is a good thing. 

I then got a brilliant idea to outdo everyone else. I googled War and Peace and found an online copy of the whole book. I copy and pasted as much as I could (my phone wouldn’t register the whole book, I know I should have seen the sign) and sent it to the chat. Everyone looked around as their phones froze, and one girl, Emma, asked me what I had done. I just smirked and said “I’ll let you know when I finish reading War and Peace”.

At that point the bell rang and we all went to our final, where people were asking about what happened in the group chat. I’d like to take this moment to say that where we live, cellular service is shitty at best, so this type of thing happens, but the massive text didn’t help. Anyway, we muted our phones and took the final. 

After the final, we switched our phones on to find they were working again. We also all had some texts from the only cellular provider in our area, which of course doesn’t offer unlimited data. The massive size of the text caused all 16 people in the class to use all of their data in their plans and be charged overage. Depending on where we were at in our cycle and how many family members share our plans, ranged how much we were notified of being billed right then and there. From our conferring with each other and the texts, between the size of the text and all the work the provider has to do to send the text with our shitty service in our quiet corner of the world, it took about 5 gigabytes for each phone to deal with this. Again, depending on person, it varied from $30 to $150 in the worst case to pay for it.

M: (confused and trying to explain that it isn't that nerdy) No, it's not that bad it's just like the FF game, except you collect like loli girls. Him and his friend play it a lot because it's also a fighting game. 

S: Oh, yeah... No I just play the FF game... 

M: Here let me show you it. (Goes to app store and pulls up game that has anime girls on the cover) See it's not that bad.

Then he changed the subject. I quickly forgot about it and didn't mention it to my husband when I got home. Last night my husband cooked dinner and I was in the living room browsing through a new sub I found (shoutout to r/justneckbeardthings). I stumbled onto the real definition of a loli and almost shit my pants. I thought that loli was just like a waifu, just an anime girl! That's why I was confused by my supervisor cringing, I thought he was weirded out by anime girls! I got up and asked my husband to confirm the definition and promptly told him about my exchange with my supervisor earlier that day. I apologized profously and told him I would fix it with my supervisor first thing tomorrow. He was a little upset, but he understood my confusion. This morning I walked up to my supervisor and told him about the mix up. He and a couple of my coworkers got a good laugh about it, but I still feel kinda bad...

She was giving me long hugs, when we were sitting together alone in the room, she would put her legs on mine and so on. At first, I wasn't very interested in her, mostly curious.

Story:

So I have a doctor's appointment with a specialist (for privacy reasons I won't say who the specialist was for). I've had to cancel a appointment three times and the specialist has a long waiting list, so they're only at the hospital twice a month. The specialist is booked and if I cancelled the appointment, I would have to reschedule and the next available appointment would be in three months. I've been needing to see the person for a while and I couldn't cancel it again because the specialist is important for the treatment I'm receiving. So today was my sibling's graduation from high school. When I learned this, my heart fell because I would not be able to see her in her cap and gown, walking down the stage to receive her high school diploma. I felt so depressed. This morning I was debating, but I chose to see the specialist, because it was important. I had to weigh the scale and chose one or the other. When I got home, I felt so upset and I felt like I wanted to vent, so I came to Reddit in hopes I would feel a little bit better. I'm hoping you guys will understand and not judge me too harshly.

TL;DR I missed my younger sibling's high school graduation because I had to go to a doctor's appointment that I've cancelled three times.

tifu,"First of all, glad to be here.
So I was in a rush to make it to my little brothers' elementary graduation. As I'm leaving work my key comes off the chain again. I think nothing of it but make sure to grab it before getting out. I went into my bag to get my portable charger because my phone is on like 7%. I'm about 5 feet from my car and realize I DONT HAVE MY CAR KEY. So I pray the door is unlocked. It isn't. I go through the whole little ceremony and momentarily forget I dont have my key. Ceremony ends and my family is trying to help me. I'm trying to find the number I called last time, but don't have my VIN or anything so I lock myself out of my payment app trying to log in frantically to get my VIN so I can call the place. So my parents have AAA and I'm on their plan but my card is expired. My dad doesn't want to call right away and goes home to get tools. Me and my other brothers are sitting outside getting eaten up by mosquitoes. He comes back and we spend like 30 minutes trying to get in. Now we live in a predominantly white neighborhood so we keep joking about someone calling the cops and how that would be a BLESSING (we are all black, 3 black men and 1 black female). So its starting to get dark and that isn't working so my dad goes to get MORE stuff. Still no calling AAA bc of the wait. We didn't originally call the police but I'd heard many times that they dont do that anymore so I didn't bother. TIME PASSES. It's after 9 PM and pretty dark out. We see a cop pull up a side street across from us and we get happy bc he's gunna see us and help right? HE TURNS THE OTHER WAY. We all were mad but kept trying it. Maybe a couple minutes pass and here he comes again pilling infront of my car. BUT WAIT THERES MORE. LITERALLY. There's more. Another one behind my dads car which us behind me, one on the side, one on either side street so we are sandwiched in and I see at least 2 move coming down the street for a grand total of 7(and counting) no sirens. I guess they wanna sneak up on a robber? Thankfully the guy who got out was nice and just asked what was up, we were all obviously happy to see him and told him I got locked out after my bros graduation, I even said it took long enough for someone to call, we been waiting for an hour! He said someone called and said someone was scaled it break into a car with a crow bar (we had a hanger and there were definitely 4 of us but ok) called whatever other units were on their way, off and we were just joking around while they got it open.

I don't think all cops are bad but we were all understandably cautious. And before anyone asks why I didn't just call the police to help. I had heard they didn't unlock doors anymore so I didn't bother but the cop told us that this was one of the only towns that still did it for free so *face palm*

When we got home my mom told us that she had seen a car go flying by with light but no siren on.

tifu,"I was using a grinder to take off some old aluminum welds so I could re-weld on a loading ramp. We didn't have any more grinding wheels for my little die grinder that could reach where I needed it. My *supervisor* suggested I stack two cutting wheels and tighten the hell out of it and just use that. Soooo I did. It was working well but as the wheels spun, they separated at their edge, creating a razor sharp wedge of aluminum between them. Every once in a while, this wedge would break off and away. I wasn't worried. I was wearing my eye protection.

Then, one of those shards skipped up off my cheek, under my eye pro and into my eye. I shut that eye hard out of reflex and found my way to the eye wash station. I rinsed it out while holding my lids open with my fingers. I closed my eye again and could feel it under my upper eyelid. Not good. I found a supervisor who drove me to the ER. 

I told the receptionist what was wrong with my eye still clenched shut to immobilize the shard. He seemed a little flustered after I explained. I left my supervisor doing workmans comp paperwork in the lobby. In the back they opened my eye to numb it with drops and the shard was right there on my eye. They scooped it out. Then lots of checks and ultra close up pictures with dye in my eye revealed a beaker mouth from the Muppets style cut on my cornea.

Context: At the high school I go to, there’s an exclusive senior parking lot that is typically empty. The car I drive is a Ford Expedition with a lot of space in the back, which is where my (ex) girlfriend and I decided to get frisky most times.

Fast forward to second period of the day of my FU. My girlfriend and I decided to have a little bit of in the back. We were back there for a solid period, and decide to leave in time for third, when we notice that a car has been pulled up in front of us. Typically that space is empty, but we think nothing of it. As we start to leave, two people from that car approach our window. I’m good friends with one of the guys, but have no clue who the other is. They come up to our window and say “that was a nice show”.... Now some people may say that it was obvious we were going to be seen in a parking lot, but we’ve been doing this for months at this point, and have never been even close to getting caught. We were both mortified, and my friend was getting a kick out of it.

I talked to him later, and apparently they pulled up about an hour in, and didn’t see much, they just thought they should fuck with us, but they told everyone I knew about the situation.

For some inexplicable reason, when I got to the counter I went stupid, I placed the entire basket on the conveyor belt and waited for the cashier to start ringing me in. I was thinking it was completely normal and was fully expecting the cashier to ring in everything without taking it out of the basket. I think I may have thought I was buying it all as one giant unit. The cashier looked dumbfounded and we stood in awkward silence. Presumably they were trying to find the words to tell me they couldn't scan a whole basket of groceries, probably asking themselves if they really had to explain to customer that they needed room to maneuver individual groceries. For a moment I couldn't figure out what the problem was. Then I suddenly remembered common sense, took the basket down, and started placing my groceries on the conveyor belt one at a time like a normal person. We both proceeded to pretend like it never happened.

I like to move along a bit when she's busy and she allowes a lot of motion, making it kinda rough. I finish my business and we get to the bathroom to brush our teeth, because it's almost midnight and I have to work the next day. There we realized that her lips swole up a bit, but we find it funny and laugh it off. Next thing, we go to sleep.

When I woke up this morning, I look over to her, only to discover that her lips had even grown more. They actually were at least TWICE her normal size. I instantly started laughing like crazy, waking her up. She looks very confused at first, but quickly realises that her lips look like she had a massive botox injection.

Sooo this was a couple of years ago, let’s say 2015ish. My parents were invited to my godparents cottage for the summer and we came along with them. Typically I don’t like going with them just because I don’t really relate to my godparents family and so I’m left to my own devices and would hang around my parents. 

This one particular day we were at the beach and I decided that I had enough for the day and walked back to the cottage to have a shower. I go into my room and decide to watch some porn. 

I’m in the middle of jacking off when I hear some noise, I pause the video and go, “Hello?”

Dad: “Hey I just got back to grab a beer and wait for the others, I’ll be outside if you need me.”

Me: “Okay dad.”

tifu,"Sorry for the bad formating and TLDR at the bottom.

So this happened to me today while I was at work. I work at Starbucks, and this event happened later in the day while we were starting to close down the store. I was making whip cream while my other coworkers are doing their various tasks.

Now, earlier in the day I heard one of my coworkers call her pen her, ""baby"" as Starbucks employees can be overly protective of their pens, because they are constantly getting their pens stolen or lost. She even said to me earlier, ""Make sure you get this back because it's my baby.""

Anyways, I was finishing up making whip creams when I could not find a pen to mark the expiration dates on the containers, but I remembered from earlier that my coworker had a pen, so I went up to her and asked for it. She said yes and gave it to me. 

One I was done with my task, I thought I would make a joke in reference to earlier, about her calling her pen her baby. Here's how that conversation went.

Me: Hey here's your pen baby.

Her: What?

Me: I said here's your pen baby back, remember from earlier how you called your pen a baby?

At this point she became overly uncomfortable and said;

Her: Oh yeah. I thought you were calling ME baby...


I had no idea what she was talking about. It took a few moments to figure out that she thought I had said, ""Here's your pen, Baby"" 

After it clicked in my dumb brain I immediately started apologizing and freaking out in my head. Thankfully she was very understanding and she will probably forget it within the next 24 hours. But I definitely won't.

tifu,"This is a story from a few years back. In my previous life I worked as a cook for a few years at an ""upscale casual"" franchise in Canada. I usually bike to work for my commute and when I looked in the garage did not see it in the usual spot. I had left it at the restaurant over the weekend and had to take transit for my commute. After a long, rough shift I just wanted to grab my bike go home and relax. I went to the back storage room where I always kept it and immediately saw it wasn't in my usual spot. Assuming someone moved it over the weekend I spent the next while looking around for it. After about 20 minutes of desperate searching I assumed that my bike had been stolen. Which was a disheartening thought when the only person who could have done it would have been a workmate. 

It was around this point one of my Sous Chef's noticed my frantic searching and disappointed face and asked what had happened. I told him that I thought someone might have stolen my bike. Well good news, there was a camera in the backroom and he said we could look through the footage to see what had happened to it. By this point a handful of other cooks who got off at the same time knew what was up and we all looked at the footage in the back office. We went back to the previous week and saw the bike there. Scrolled forward and it was gone. The control to speed up or slow down was finnicky and could jump very quickly. One second the bike was there, the next it wasn't. After a bit of back and forth we tracked down the last day it was there which was a Friday (last shift of the previous week and some alarm bells went off in my head). Finally we were coming to the moment the bike was taken. I see a figure stumble into frame with a blue backpack. This was the moment I realized this was a TIFU. It was Friday the last shift of a rough week and as is tradition I got absolutely blackout drunk wasted. So now this drunken a*hole grabs my bike and inexplicably looks up right at the camera. I already knew it but the face that I saw staring back at me, was my own. Immediately everyone starts laughing and making fun of me. My Sous Chef rips out of the office and proceeds to tell every Server and Cook working what had just happened. And I became the guy who stole his own bike.

I left feeling like a complete idiot. When I checked the garage at home again lo and behold, thrown in the back corner in a slump was my bike.

The next day I found out from another cook who wasn't there to see my fall from grace but had heard the stories, that he saw me on the subway with my bike and apparently I was talking to him the whole time. On the bright side at least I didn't bike home drunk. On the down side I will never not be the person who stole my own bike.

tifu,"Pulling out an account from my stable of funny alt names for this one. Obligatory this just happened, bla bla bla. Anywho, I am away from home on a business trip, staying in a wonderful hotel which will no longer pass the flourescent light test. Let me explain... since I was going to be away for a week in a hotel room with my penis, I decided to find some interesting ways of jerking it during my time away. I hardly take the little guy out anymore. Eventually I found a Youtube video in which an enginuitive young soul creates a kind of pocket pussy using only a condom, a bottle cap, and some lube (here's the link: https://youtu.be/S-YuS_LFQ5s) by stretching the cap through the condom, and twisting it at the other end. I decided to try this. Brother, when I tell you it's nice, it's fucking nice. So I'm in here squeaking away on my latex wondersleeve, but I didn't notice that the twist at the end of the condom was coming undone. Eventually, mid-stroke, the cap comes flying back at my junk, as things tend to do when in what is essentially a slingshot with lube. Luckily I didn't get a direct hit, so all is well. I get it back in there (the cap), get it back in there (my penis), and this time hold the cap at the other end. Cool, it worked. Eventually I finished doing what I was doing, and it seemed to work out well. There's only one problem: what do I do with the cum coated balloon? I couldn't let go of the balloon, because the cap would fly out and take my load with it. I decided to pinch the condom with two fingers so that I could rip the latex, then let the air out slowly. The only problem was that the lube made my fingers slip, and the air was let out a lot faster than I was expecting. What I am saying is that the condom popped and unleashed a bukkake confetti that would make Hitomi Tanaka blush. There's drops of splooge in the AC unit.

I’m not really sure what to do, mainly because I don’t know if I believe that this is actually happening.

About a week prior to this, I made a post that described how my girlfriend’s grandpa had been staring at her ass and that I told her about it:

It made me so angry when this happened, I couldn’t really think except for one thought: “I wish this pervert was dead.”

That single thought had more sincerity than most of my other thoughts. It was like it was my duty to think about it. Obviously, I didn’t think it would just magically come true though...

But now, just a few minutes ago, my girlfriend texted me that he was in the hospital from heart failure, pneumonia, and a blood clot in his lungs.

Just about 5 minutes ago I received a message from a lady asking if it was still available, I replied yes and waited for her reply. 

*I’ll let you guys know, I’m VERY high. My boyfriend and I have been smoking all night and hit some dabs minutes before she started to message me. *

While I waited for her to reply my boyfriend (being the high guy he is) showed me a very weird pornhub video. My phone automatically opened it in Safari and it acts glitchy sometimes. So I copied the website and headed over to Chrome. The video was down right weird and hilarious. While watching the video I received a reply from the lady asking for the specs of the tablet. I reply and instantly just paste what’s recently on my clipboard and press send without giving it a second thought...only until it was sent. I instantly knew what I did and start laughing and panicking at the same time. I’m yelling to my boyfriend “Heyyyyyyy! I fucked up! I need your help! What do I do!?!?”  I couldn’t iterate what happened to him between me yelling and laughing my ass off.  He grabs my phone and stares at the screen then bursts out laughing. 

I was super embarrassed and didn’t know what to say to the lady. It took me 5 minutes to come up with a reply “Please don’t look at that. I’m soooo sorry!”  She had already saw the link before I replied and it made me feel so bad.

tifu,"To preface, my reproductive system is a shit show. I've never had a proper cycle, and would spend 70% of the year in a world of crampy pain for 3-5 periods a year.

I've been on birth control for 10+ years, and I haven't had an actual period for ~4 years. Cramps still suck, but less frequent and not gushing for a week+ is glorious. I went with a friend to get feminine hygiene products a month ago, and couldn't remember the last time I bought them for myself. Glorious. 

That was until this week, a friend was complaining about her time of the month. I empathised, advised lots of chocolate etc. The usual treatment. Later in the day I started to get sympathy cramps. Cramps happen (especially on my newish BC), so I've been on this ride before. No problems.

They get worse over the next day and I get moodier. It must be one of those bad 'months' (happens every 2-3 months).

Then the chocolate craving hits. I'm not a sweet tooth, but it was all I could think about. Then this morning, I'm running between meetings and duck into the bathroom, and I've nearly bleed through my undies and stockings, on to my dress. I'm trying to rush to the supermarket and people keep stopping me. I miss my next meeting to grab pads and a massive amount of chocolate.

He was insecure about his looks and needed the attention of other women. He was always so excited when a costumer flirted with him.

Then one day he told me about his college. A girl that had obviously a crush on him. And after a few month of being  'friends', I knew he was interested in doing more with her.
We talked about it. A LOT. I was not ok with the idea that he had something going on with another woman. He tried to convince me almost every day that it was beneficial for us. 

Then I really fucked up by telling him ""You can do what ever you feel comfortable with""
Obviously he felt comfortable with fucking his colleague in our living room when I was at work.

tifu,"So  today my friend came to my house to help me with some programming for  studies. When she arrived we were talking about bunch of random stuff.

Later  she started talking about her crush who now has a grirlfriend and i saw how  she was trying not to cry. I know her well so I played her favourite  band and hugged her on my couch. We fell to the side and kept lying on a couch. Today is a hot day so we had no strenght to do anything and we were lying in the spot in my room where is the best sound so we didn't want to move. My  parents should be back from work in two hours. I wasn't even thinking  about them so didn't even close the door to my room. After 10 minutes I  hear someone saying ""Oh hello"". It was my mom and she was looking at us in  this strange pose hugging. My mom came back early because she got sick and I  couldn't hear her because the music. Now she keeps asking me about this  situation. She thinks that my friend is my girlfriend and she doesn't  believe me that it was nothing more than just trying to help my friend  feel better.

tifu,"So I had just gotten to the gym right after work and was beginning my warmup, which usually includes a few sets of medicine ball slams. Now when you do these, you're supposed to use the balls that DON'T bounce (as any right-minded person would know).  I was looking for a 30lb ball and the only ones available at the time only went up to 10lbs. On auto-pilot mode, not thinking straight, I decided to grab one of the 30lb rubber ones that apparently WILL BOUNCE BACK. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few minutes later, as I'm right in front of about 5 rows of people on cardio equipment (my back to them), I squat down, hoist the ball over my head, and slam it down as hard as I can. Next thing I know, I'm met with what felt like an uppercut from Mike Tyson straight to the jaw. It was at this point that I realized I fucked up.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing that I had just bounced a ball straight back up into my face in front of about 30 people, but not realizing the extent of the damage, I turned around to face everyone and laugh it off. The combination of the look of confusion/horror on their faces and the creeping surge of pain made me realize something else was up. Turns out the medicine ball caused my four front lower teeth to puncture all the way through my lip. I can only imagine what was going through the minds of the witnesses as they saw what appeared to be a guy intentionally bounce a 30lb ball straight into his face, only to turn around to laugh at them with blood pouring out of his mouth. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up with 5 stitches, liquid diet for a week so the stitches don't tear, and I have to keep the scar out of the sun all Summer. I've called the gym to see if I could get the footage and they don't have a security camera at that spot so I don't even have a funny video of it as consolation.

tifu,"Post I saw on r/WaspHating made me think of posting this story here. This happened probably 10 years ago but I still remember it like it was yesterday. 

I was in my bedroom (I was about 16 when this happened) in the middle of the day doing something. Can’t recall what, probably browsing for terrible music to feed my teen angst or looking for some new Myspace layout that would slay the ladies. Regardless, I heard a buzzing coming from near my window. Let me preface this by explaining how terrified I am of wasps. I don’t know why I have this ingrained fear, but I do. They scare the shit out of me. 

So I go to investigate the source of the noise, assuming it’s a fly or mosquito trapped in the window curtains. Negative ghost rider, it’s a red fucking wasp staring straight at me. I screamed like a little bitch, and immediately look for something to arm myself with against the invasion. Weapon of choice? Video game magazine. I decide that I must destroy the evil murder missile to save my household. I give it the equivalent of a sack tap, and it falls, lifeless, into a shoe I had underneath the window. VICTORY! I had slain the airborne stabby ant, and saved my family from certain death....or so I thought.

Fast forward 4-6 hours. It’s late at night and I’m laying in bed. I’m a 16-17 yo guy who’s got too much time on his hands and access to the internet late at night, it’s batin time. I load whatever video suited my fancy that night and started into a solid rhythm. 5-6 minutes in I feel a little tickle near the happy sacks, I adjust because maybe the blanket is itchy, right as I start to get back into the down stroke, I feel like I’ve been shot next to my nutsack. A horrible stinging and burning sensation engulfs the whole area. I flew off that bed like selfish rich man abandoning the Titanic. I look down at the package and less than an inch from the bojangles is a massive red welt. Da fuq?

I whip the blanket off the bed, and sitting there shaking it’s stinger at me is the fucking wasp. We exchange looks at each other, him waving his stinger at me, and me with dick pointed squarely at him, and we draw. I grabbed the shoe I thought he died in and began whipping the wasp like he stole a loaf of bread in ancient Babylon. I’m swinging as hard as I can, and my dinger is making a perfect arch in symphony with my arm. I killed the little bastard, and disposed of him in the toilet. Can’t swim can you bitch?

Needless to say, after my last encounter with the murder bug, I finished myself off and applied ointment to the wound. All is well, no long lasting damage from the proximity of the sting. 

TL;DR Thought I killed a wasp. Didn’t. Almost stung me in the sack while masturbating.

tifu,"Ok so to give some background info, I live in a small city, however, traffic gets extremely bad at rush hour. My college is on the other side of the city (about a 45-minute drive), and my classes start about thirty minutes before rush hour. Also, I have a very small car so the engine can get flooded really easily if it starts raining.

Today I felt like skipping class but against my better judgment, I went. As soon as I get to college, I find out that both of my classes were canceled. To further add to my disgrace, it starts pouring rain, I'm talking biblical flood and shit. So I go to my building's break room to hang out for a while. Two hours go by and the rain hasn't stopped, I'm like fuck this, I'm leaving. I get in my car and about twenty minutes later the car breaks down, the engine got filled with water and I had to get it towed.

Now my engine has water damage which I have to pay for and I also have to pay a tow truck. I also wasted an entire day for nothing. Should have fucking skipped school altogether.

I stepped into the shower and did my business and while standing there I see my step-moms razor on the shower shelf. Instantly my friend telling me how much better it feels to masturbate after. I do the deed with the razor and after I realize how much hair there is in the razor. I clean it out and find hair still in between the grooves of the razor. Noticing this and being the dumbass I am I realize i can scrape this hair out with my dads mouth pick for his permanent retainer. While getting his pick I open a drawer to find multiple pills of a variety of colors. One pill looks like a Viagra pill from those commercials and low and behold through some internet searching it is. The next pills after looking it up are what I think are Molly. I’m pretty surprised to see this in my dad, the average joe banker. So now I’ve got this secret I can only tell strangers anonymously!

I'm unpacking the shopping, starting on making dinner and tidying up all at once. I put the four cans of lager I bought for my husband in the fridge, dutifully tare the plastic ring holder things into tiny pieces, open the three bottles of Cider I'd bought for myself, put the metal lids in the recycling. Get an onion from the pantry, turn round, see three open bottles of Cider. Think ""wait, I took all the empties to the bottle bank... wait... Wtf did I do."" 

Then I remember clinking off all three tops at once. No idea why I did it. Never done it before. Just zombified, auto-pilot me clearly thought it was time to get drinking.

I've put the tops back on, but they're not sealed properly. They'll leak if I lay them down in the fridge and they're going to go flat.

Now when I tell you that I'm a paranoid person I'm talking about I throw my hand in the backseat of my car before driving off at night to make sure a killer isn't hiding below the space of the carseats. So when I activated this tablet I called amazon to make SURE it would not synch up to my gmail in anyway or anything on my phone, I had that part covered (yes this was a fire tablet). The problem was that my mother had no email/amazon account so I had to make one for her and i did it ON MY PHONE. The problem with this is that I don't really check my email on my chrome browser on my phone, so I had no idea I had been logged into her google account on my phone until today.

Now you might take this next part as an exaggeration, but it's not. When I tell you I look at the most disgusting and embarrassing porn that I will take with me to the grave and not admit it even if there is a gun to my head I mean it. I use my phone specifically for this purpose. I had an incognito browser but I don't like the way that when I press back I have to type everything out again so I get lazy and use chrome. Yes I'm sure you know where this is going but hold your horses it gets worse. I have a nephew who is 2 years old. Yes, be happy you aren't me right now.

Well a few weeks ago I had noticed them playing on the tablet together looking and stuff and then she had a odd look on her face and promptly stopped using the tablet. When I tell you that my mom has not touched that tablet NOR anyone in the house for 2 months I am not joking. I asked my mom why she doesn't use it and she said she lost the charger? At the time I didn't think too much of it and figured i was being paranoid (because I am).

&amp;#x200B;

Today when I browsed through chrome I noticed in small text that I was signed into an account and it had my mother's email that I had made, my heart stopped immediately. If it was some normal ""big boobs"" or ""dude smashes blonde"" or some generic shit I wouldn't care. Unfortunately I have the most disgusting and weird fetishes that no one would ever admit to and now I know that everyone in my family has seen the shit I search. I noticed people started treating me differently the past few months and now I know why.

I have a thing for girls in leggings and yoga pants, a particularly throbbing thing, I’ll admit that. One specific account I stumbled across I’ve since learned is very much too close to home. At first I thought nothing of it and did my thing, as one does. But then I recognised a few things. First was a door, and then an entranceway to a house, and then as I scrolled down I recognised a kitchen, and then a living room. In case you haven’t latched on, the rooms I recognised were the very same ones in my house, and it dawned on me that the absolute only owner of this insta account that I’d been not only following, but also flowing over, was that of my one and only dear sister. I’ve since unfollowed and tried to forget about it, but had to write it down here for therapeutic purposes. Needless to say I won’t be letting her in on what I stumbled across or what happened.

I get to the stop sign and stop. Look one way. I'm a little distracted at that moment as my kid is talking to me. Proceed to start going forward then thud (I'm hitting maybe 10 mph at this point). Look over and I see the teen (looks about 15-16). go into ""oh shit"" mode. I ask him if he's okay and I tell him I'm sorry. Couple of witnesses around to see. Don't care about them keep asking if he's okay.  The teen Literally just says ""what"" and keeps walking like it never happened (could tell he's pissed though). There's a lady that pulled over and says she recorded everything (doubtful as she is recording on her cell and just happened to drive by.)

tifu,"Tifu (This happened about a year ago but It came up today.) My girlfriend likes to get a little kinky during sex, whereas I typically am pretty tame. We had been talking about easing me into getting kinkier over the past few months. This usually requires me to have a drink or two just to make me comfortable in unfamiliar territory. Here is how the day went:

I got off work around 4pm and we had plans to grab a few drinks later at a couple of the bars downtown. We frequently did this and have always had a great time doing so. I knew it was going to be a freaky night when my girlfriend tipped a woman who was “spanking for tips” on the sidewalk $10 to spank her with the wooden paddle on top of all the comments she made about wanting to “fuck” tonight. Afterwards, we have a few drinks at the bars until around 1am, we were both fairly drunk, me more so than her. I got us an Uber to take us back to her apartment and as soon as we get through the door of her apartment she starts stripping butt naked, so I follow suit. Once stripped down we performed a little foreplay with spanking and such. Before long, she was on top riding me and I get a brilliant idea to talk dirty to her while being completely shit-faced because she really loves it. Keep in mind, I’m very drunk. In my head, I said,”Give me that pussy you nasty slut” but what came out of my mouth was,”Give me that nasty pussy.” My girlfriend immediately stopped exactly what she was doing and responded with, “Are you fucking serious right now?” At this point, I realized just couldn’t keep myself from laughing. 

Now, instead of apologizing and trying to explain what happened, I just laid there laughing, to which she promptly gets off of me and refuses to talk to me until the next morning. I explained it all to her in the morning and apologized.

I spent a month in Yangshuo, China to teach English in the summer of 2017. It's a really cool place with a blend of beautiful rural areas and a cool little city.

One night we went out to hit the city area, and went to this cool bar called the DMZ bar. I got separated from my friends and wound up talking to this Chinese woman who spoke great English, and was very polite. She asked if she could come hang out with my friends and I — I was buzzed and feeling social so I told her that she could come along, thinking nothing of it. 

We wound up at another bar and an older man approached me and told me the woman was was ""bad news"". The woman looked uncomfortable but told me to buy her a drink at the bar, so I did. As soon as the bartender saw her, the bartender started screaming ""get the fuck out of here you whore we told you never to come here again!"" They kicked her out and the bartender told me the girl was a prostitute.

tifu,"So this happened early yesterday. I’m still trying to find home remedies for this. So, I'm a high school senior. The graduation is Friday, and my school is having senior activity week. Yesterday was a pool party, and so I got everything I needed, including some spray on sunscreen that I got from my mom. I trusted it would actually work. There was an expiration date, but I didn’t think that it applied to something like sunscreen. I believed the expiration date was there because some US department forces them to add one. So I had someone spray it one me to make sure of even coverage. I was ready to go, or so I thought. Later that day, my shoulder was really itchy, and after a few minuets, it started to sting. I took off my shirt, and looked in a mirror. That area was as red as an apple. All I could think was “what the hell, how could this happen if I used sunscreen?!” Then, I remembered that I read somewhere that sunscreen can actually expire and become ineffective. Then, I looked at the date, it was in 2018. All I could say was “well shit”. I’ve been suffering since like 2 pm yesterday. If you’re going to a pool or the beach, make sure your sunscreen is still good. If it’s out of date, play it safe, and throw the old stuff away, and get some new sunscreen.

tifu,"This happened 3 hours ago.

Some backstory: I’m going to be continuing my golfing throughout high school, so I signed up for a weights class that only cool athletes like me can take to help condition them. Cool. I thought that was that. Apparently they highly recommend a summer program too to keep you in shape and prepare you for the class. I was like “This can’t be too bad, right?” So I also signed up for that. 

Bam, now we teleport to today, where I now have to do the daunting task of going to the summer class. I get up around 6 (class is at 7:45) and notice that I have a little bit of back pain. I decide to shower it off and take a pain killer and move on. I decided to still go and exert myself as normal. As I headed upstairs, I got flashbacks of when I tried to run 8 minute miles and got extremely nauseous due to the excessive amount of food and water that I drank. I decided to take small sips throughout the workout only to prevent this  and eat only an apple for breakfast. You may be thinking “Is this guy fucking stupid? Eating only an apple and not drinking water, even though he’s been sleeping for like 9-10 hours?” And the correct answer is, yes. Yes I am.

I get to my school and head to the gym for warmups, feeling a bit tired but knowing that will probably change as I get more into it. I finished the warmups ready to go! I wanted to rule the world and lift all the weight I could. We took a water break, small sip, and went up to the weights room at the top of the stairs.

We are then presented with a 3 set rotational circuit of Landmines, Knee rows, and goblet squats, which isn’t too bad, with alternations of form exercises. I finish the 2 first workouts, the alternating knee rows and the goblet squats before eventually arriving at the land mines. I do the first set and feel fine. My partner then suggested I add 5 pounds and I decided to try. I couldn’t even finish the set, even with an extra 5 pounds, and knew something was wrong. I stupidly decided to keep going.

After the third set, I felt a tad bit dizzy and nauseous, and decided to drink some of my water and sit down, while everyone else was standing. There were some others nauseous, but not as much as me. I decide to sit into the back to try to take some deep breaths, and I suddenly feel very sleepy. The assistant teachers notice that I’m pale as a beach, and guide me to the other room. I had a leg give out, and the teacher helped me by wrapping his arms around me to make sure I didn’t fall. I then blacked out.

They say it was only a minute, but I felt like I was out for an hour. I woke up and I was now moved to the other side of the room and the class was gone with a school medical team surrounding my side and the assistant teachers. The main teacher was nowhere to be found. I assume they finished the last circuit in the main gym. They ask me a few questions and they realize I fainted and lost consciousness due to a lack of energy and dehydration due to me not eating enough or drinking enough. 

Needless to say, my mom picked me up, I was wheeled out with sympathetic teachers by my side, and I felt that I just embarrassed myself to a point where I felt like I shouldn't take the class anymore. I still feel a bit awful, both physically and emotionally. The moral? Breakfast actually is the most important meal of the day. Oh, and drink a lot of water when you wake up.

If any of my classmates at school are reading this, I can confirm I had a certified bruh moment today.

By the time the movie ended and I had talked to other nerds about the potential of the Xmen in the MCU I walked to my car feeling hungry. I decided to head to Chipotle which closed at 22:00. But as I got closer decided to driver farther down the road to Chick-fil-A, they also close at 22:00 so no big deal. As I usually do on the ride over I pull out my phone and proceed to place my order on the Chick-fil-A app. It basically let's you place your order  before you arrive and decide how you'll pick up your order. The options being curbside, in-side pickup, or drive through. Me being the anti-social person I am select curbside. Right before I enter the parking lot of the restaurant my order is done. A grilled chicken club sandwich no cheese, large fruit cup, and a large Arnold Palmer with unsweet tea. As the order is placed I close the app and pull into the designated parking spot and wait for my order. At this time it is 21:37, 23 minutes until Chick-fil-A closes. As I usually do I open Reddit and Spotify and just chill and wait for my food to come out. I wait, and wait, and wait some more. At this point I feel like it's been a long time so I head back to the app to see if they are making my order still. When I open the app I seee 'Head to the restaurant"". This is the fuck up part. You see Chickfila being the amazing palace of fast food they are wait for you to arrive at the store. Then once you are here the GPS on my phone let's the  Chick-fil-A app know I am here. Then I'm directed to another scree with a red button that says ""START MY ORDER"". I click on it and get a screen that says ""Sorry the store is now closed."" I looked to the top left of my phone screen it read 22:01. THE STORE HAD BEEN CLOSED FOR 1 MINUTE. The entire time I was waiting for my food the store didn't even know I was here. To them I was just some random playing IGOR really loud(great album btw y'all should def listen to it).

tifu,"This act of eating fish occurred yesterday, however the effects presented itself today.

Yesterday I went to have Japanese cuisine for lunch, I went to this Japanese restaurant recommended by my parents for their reasonably priced lunch menu items. I was looking through the menu to have Cod Fish teriyaki style, however the restaurant did not have it; one of the reasons may be due to the price of Cod have increased significantly in the recent years and most restaurants have either drastically increased the price or replaced it with something else. Still wanting cooked white fish, I began searching through the menu for the next best option. I saw a picture of a golden brown cooked fish called Buterfish and I ordered it.

The Butterfish meal I ordered arrived, the set also includes some sashimi, some steamed egg and a bowl of rice which are standard additions to most Japanese cuisine over here. The fish was great, presentation, texture and taste was good. It also had that fish oil sensation which I really like. I told myself this is surely the Cod fish replacement I would eat from now on.

After the delicious meal, I continued my day as usual. 

Today, I had a day off and wanted to enjoy some morning sun so I went for a walk in the park first thing in the morning. Somewhere in the middle of the park, I suddenly felt the urge to fart. Since nobody was around, I let it rip! Unfortunately, the fart felt more powerful than usual and wet, really wet. I was like oh shit, I think I shart my pants. Fearing the worst, I touched my pants and it was indeed wet. The shart residue on my hands felt and smelt funny, I can only describe it as cooking oil with essence of ass.

So I quickly walked home, making sure I avoided anyone in sight, with my butt cheeks and hands lubricated with what I think is cooking oil. Once home I struggled to get the keys to open the door as my hands were full of oily shart. I made it to the toilet and pooped a few tablespoons of oil, more than  enough to saute a whole meal.

After hand washing the oil off my underwear and pants and cleaning up. I felt scared as I had though I had a health problem. So I Googled for answers and diagnosed myself with pancreatic cancer, I was terrified and pondered whether to go see the doctor. Further searching using slightly different terms reveled a different but shocking answer and I was relieved. It turns out that a certain fish such as escolar can cause ""orange oily discharge from your ass(keriorrhea)"" and in plenty of cases butterfish is mislabeled as escolar. Now I am at home and cancelling all plans as I am scared of the possibility of further sharting incidents for the next 24 hours.

In Poland we have grades 1 to 6. 1 is the worst and 6 is the best. My friend wanted to get a 4 in math at the end of the year, since the average scores will be on your school certificate, and you give it to your high school that you chose since we are in the 8th class.

We have behavior points, you get positive and negative. To get ""excellent"" behavior on your certificate you need 300 positive and the amount of negatives has to be less than 30. Otherwise it will be very good.

We have teachers for subjects and a (i don't know how to say it, maybe a class teacher) that just is when we go on trips and have normal lessons with. (for polish people, it's a wychowawca).

As I said, my friend wanted to get an 4. He asked our math teacher if she could give him a test or ask him to get the better grade. She said yes, and he would have to do an test/be asked by her the next day.

**Day 2:**

My friend sat by himself in the class (we sit in 2 people tables) as the teacher told him, and she chose the questions that he would have to complete. He was thinking that the question was hard.

He said: ""This question is hard, maybe I could pay you for a better grade?"". My friend thought this was a funny joke, but my teacher didn't. She told him to sit down and he couldn't do the questions now. She was really offended by this and one of the things she said was ""I teach in this school for a lot of years and no student was this disrespectful to her"".

She told him that he will write an essay about why his joke was inappropriate and it had to be signed by his parents.

After some time, she did let him write that test, since she teaches math and behavior points are two different things. She talked with our class teacher and he got 20 negative points later. It won't affect his behavior score, since he didn't even have close to 300 positive points

**Day 3:**

He gave the teacher the essay and said sorry about his behavior. She read the essay and commented on it by saying: ""**FriendName,** think three times before saying anything.""

He got the better grade and now we are joking about his stupidity.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Don't joke to your teachers, especially when you want a better grade. My friend wanted a better grade in his report card, wanted to do a test for the better grade. Thought the questions were hard and as a joke said that he could pay for it.",TIFU for joking that I could pay my teacher for a better grade
tifu,"Happened last week.

Business is going well and wanted to treat my wife to a nice dinner at Mastros. If you haven't heard about it, it's a pretty upscale restaurant that serves steaks and fish.

After the amazing dinner I had to hurry and use the restroom so I walked in and immediately saw purple walls, thinking,"" huh.. I dont remember ever seeing a men's restroom with purple walls but whatever.""

Suddenly look to my left to see where the urinals are and say out loud,"" Oh Shit is this the womens restroom?"" Because there happened to be a guy who was a bit heavier and had some pretty... well plump man boobs.

The bathroom attendant looked at me puzzled, and I said even louder,"" am I in the womens restroom?"" Which catches the guy who I thought was a girls attention and looked directly at me with the ,"" what in the hell did you just say?"" Look.

I quickly peak outside to verify I'm in the men's restroom and come to find thankfully I was... just found out a few moments too late.

tifu,"This happened a year or two ago, but I still feel bad about it and hopefully you all can get a laugh out of my misfortune.

So three friends and I decided one night to take some acid and watch some fractal documentaries and cartoons and shit. Three of us had done it before and my other friend wanted to try it. We have one sober friend as our baby sitter who just wanted to make fun of us and all the stupid shit we were about to say.

So we all take our paper and we're sitting on my bed in the dorms watching this wonderful documentary about fractals and sacred geometry and all starting to get a little giggly after an hour. My friend who hasn't taken it before says she doesn't feel anything while the rest of us just start spacing out. Than out of nowhere she starts shaking and he eyes roll to the back of her head. I hadn't experienced anyone having a seizure before and my dumbass immediately thought she was making a joke. I loudly exclaimed, ""oh so funny, great acting there!"" And than to my horror she started gagging and throwing up on my pillows. Our sober friend immediately grabs her in a bear hug and holds her on her side while I call the safe number for the university for anyone experiencing drug or alcohol sickness. (The line is used to make sure people aren't afraid of calling for help for drugs/alcohol on campus. The caller or person in need of help won't get in trouble with the school.) My other two friends who are now tripping super hard panic and just run back to their rooms to hide. I than had to clean up all the paraphernalia lying around my dorm room for when the ambulance and police show up. Thankfully adrenaline is an absolute hell of a drug because I somehow stayed composed and spoke the EMTs and police for about 45 minutes while they tended to my friend and brought her to the hospital around the corner. One older policewomen did tell me not to come visit her until I sobered up but besides that all the conversations somehow went smoothly. After cleaning up the vomit and just regaining my composure I went to the hospital and found my friend being released only an hour or so after being admitted. Apparently benzos and hydration kill a trip instantly. This is where I also learned she was on anti-depressants and other presciption pills that she probably should've mentioned before doing recreational hallucinogens. Once everything was okay I was crucified in a loving way about the bad jokes I made as our friend was a having a seizure. It came up this morning when I was getting coffee with our than sober friend so I thought I'd share. Don't do drugs if you're on a plethora of prescription pills.

tifu,"Obligatory didn't happen today, more like 20 years ago, also mobile. 

One night after work, back in my single days, I went with a couple of my coworkers to our usual bar. My friend pointed out one of the regulars that he happened to know was a little, let's just say friendly. 

I start talking to her and eventually it comes time for us to order a round. I ask what she's having, Woodpecker Cider, and I order one for her in addition to my Budweiser. Bartender brings over the two drinks and I pull out just enough cash to cover my beer and a small tip. He kinda looks at me like ""okay buddy"" and then looks over to the girl and tells her that she owes whatever her drink cost. She kinda laughs and reaches under her stool for her purse. 

Now if it wasn't already painfully obvious that I had no game whatsoever, the next part will convince you. 

She pays for her drink and while still sitting next to me at the bar, turns her back on me. Me, still being completely oblivious to what it is I did wrong, look over at the friend who introduced us. He comes over and whispers in my ear ""I think she wanted you to buy her that drink"" and that dear reader is when I realized I was a complete moron and would get no play that night.

Starts rocking back and forth and talking to herself. She then proceeds to go out to my yard (a couple acre yard) and pacing back and forth. I'm worried about her and think other friend may have slipped her some Lucy but was assured this hadnt happened. Me feeling responsible for the girl and not knowing wtf is going on because I had never seen someone freak out like this off pot before start pacing next to her in an effort to calm her. After about an hour of this I go get some NyQuil and just have her guzzle some to put her to bed. Next day comes she goes home and nobody sees or hears from her for 3 days. I forgot to mention she was a coworker as well. When she shows up to work she informs us that her family took her to church and convinced her she had a homosexual and drug addicted demon in her and performed 3 exorcisms.

So a bit ""backstory"" before I get to the f-up to show how stupid I am: around 8 years ago I went to a funeral on an empty stomach.  It was terrible and I felt sick. I obviously didn't learn from that.


So now forward to a month ago when im about to attend a funeral.  It was a long drive and started at lunch time so when i was leaving my house I wasn't that hungry.  I did however pack one of those meal replacement bars that covered in 'white chocolate' for when I got hungry.  An hour later I'm in the parking lot of the church and am a bit hungry,  I didn't eat the bar though because I didn't what the white chocolate to smudge on my clothes; there was also lunch after so I thought ""How long could it be?"". 


20 minutes into the service and my stomach really wants food. I try every thing not to make my stomach growl. I swallow a lot of spit, I suck my tummy in, I pray to God, not really sure if this helped at all but we'll just act like it did. So I do this for an hour waiting for this guy to stop talking about his mom that passed so we could get on to the food. I try my hardest not to growl and so far it works. Then comes the final prayer so my mind goes ""Finally lunch!"". The pastor asked for a moment of silence to remember the one who passed. I couldn't hold it, i couldn't help it,  my stomach lets out a big loud *urrrrrrrrrruragrrrrrrrrrrrlllllllrr*. 

Kill me now



Even though all eyes were closed I felt them all on me. I wish I was the one getting buried. It felt awful.  Then when the prayer ends the pastor prays over the food. After that I get excited and am about to leave for the reception,  but then he says ""Lets end with some hymns!"", screw him. I learned my lesson,  never not eat before a funeral.   Had a nice lunch though.

I head to the checkout line to get the money and the girl behind me in line is very cute/pretty and me and her start talking. It’s my turn and the cashier starts to take her items before I tell him that it wasn’t mine and I’m just here for the Coin Star. He apologizes and gives me the cash.

Before I go to leave, this girl turns to me and says something along the lines of “I was wondering if you could buy me a drink.” I laughed, thinking she was joking because she had beer, but the look on her face when I laughed made it very clear that she meant it in a “can I get your number to go out sometime,” and not a joke. She didn’t laugh with me and just looked actually sad that I had laughed at her attempt to flirt. I didn’t realize how much of an idiot I was until I drove out of the parking lot.

I told this story to my friend, as I wasn’t 100% certain I had fucked up, and she told me that she was most likely hitting on me.

Ok so this tifu is like 8 years old but it comes back to this day and i feel horrible even thinking i was a part of this.

Once i was 9 had a friend who was very horny, he was 14 at the time and had a hot cousin i remember. Alright so one day we were on a rooftop and he asked me do u want to see sex? Im like ye? Yeeeeees.

He said he has a friend who was a girl and at the time maybe 9 or younger idk. Anyway we go find this girl and hes like ""hey uhh do you.... like.... Uhhh want to have sex with me"" she goes ""yeah""

We found a cool house that the owners had left and got in their front yard. He dropped his pants and she dropped hers and i dont even remember after that but i assume they didnt have sex.

Anyway i was rly excited as a kid to see someone have sex in front of me but didnt tell anyone. The girl did tho. But she didnt just say that that guy did all that. She got me into this. She talked to her parents and her dad came to school next morning looking for me. Me, about to shit my pants, heard him and went to the office. There he said i know what happened (very mad) and im gonna embarrass you in front of all your friends and teachers. I dont know if i was crying or not but i said these words ""It wasnt me sir"" and i dont remember anything else from his visit at school.

Anyway i never rly talked to this girl again, or that guy, but that dude over the past years even now sends me friend requests. I dont decline them i just dont accept them. I just dont want nothing to do with this event.

Today this girl sent me a follow request followed by a message : Hey Jerry the Rat i dont know if u remember me but i was living where u live 8 years ago, I found many old friends and followed them.

I sent her back saying: I dont think i remember you but i remember your brother.

Now if her father rly told everyone then my friends who are getting followed by her on insta will instantly remember and if nit instantly then someone will and will remind them. I dont want anyone rly talking about this because eventually someone will come up to me and ask me if its true or not, either my girlfriend or a friend.

tifu,"TIFU (well, my husband and I did) by pulling our five-year-old son's first tooth. An hour ago he was showing us how it was really loose and we said we would pull it out. He has been excited all along about the tooth fairy, losing baby teeth, and getting adult teeth so we figured it would just be a quick pull and done. Well, after a few minutes of him pulling his body and mouth back away from the pulling, I finally had enough of a grip to pull it out. 

He wasn't too excited after it was out, so my husband and I took him to the bathroom to see the new gap between his teeth. Since he couldn't see the little gap from the vanity mirror, I pulled my makeup/magnified mirror closer to him to see it. He took a look at it, his eyes rolled back, he started falling forward, then did a quick fall backwards. My husband caught him as he was falling (carefully) by the neck in a quick dad reaction. Unfortunately, he managed to still hit his head on the linoleum flooring a little. 

Once my husband grabbed and carried him to our bedroom, we checked him for signs of a concussion. It seems he had only passed out a little at this point. We gave him water and have him resting by us for the night.

tifu,"Obligatory, this happened a few years ago, when I was living by myself. Originally posted as a response to an r/AskReddit, but then I realized I should share for the amusement of all. First post, so please forgive my inevitable mistakes.

One day, a few years back, I am in my apartment by myself making the bald man cry, and I get a brilliant idea. If I heat up my balls while getting the job done, something better will happen, right? It will feel better or maybe I’ll become the hero I was always meant to be. I don’t know, horny logic is shitty.

So, looking around for a ball compatible heat source, I get the worst idea of my life. I’ll use an iron! You know, the type you iron clothes with. But, after putting it on the lowest setting, it’s still too fucking warm. Oh I know, I’ll put some cloth between it, and dampen the searing iron waiting to cook my berries. Of course, I’ll need something to keep everything snug and free my hands to achieve my prime directive, so I’ll pull my underwear down a little, wedge the iron with the cloth over it in my drawers, and let this compress into my balls. We’re hands free now, boys! In the beginning, this was working pretty well. The heat felt nice, and I was just going to town. Here comes the fuck up. With every action comes an equal and opposite (and unfortunate) reaction. As I said, I was beating my man like he owed me money. All the motion caused the cloth protecting my balls To. Fucking. Slip.

Nothing in life really prepares you for a moment like this. I don’t remember much. Frantically scrambling. Pain. Screaming a little. Repeating in my head over and over again “Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit”. The feeling of my searing testicles trying to suck themselves into my asshole to escape their fate. You see, my little hands-free trick screwed me. The elastic band of my boxers was pressing the instrument of scrotal destruction into my junk without mercy.

One thing was seared into my memory though. By the time I managed to get the iron free of my boxers, the damage was already done. To my absolute horror, my balls were burned literally black. No, this isn’t a ploy to make you think I have dark skin. I’m as white as it gets. My poor nuts looked like you left some chicken in the oven too long on broil. The shower immediately afterwards (getting clean makes you heal faster and safer) was the most painful shower I’ve ever had or ever will have ever again.

The following days, I had to go to work. I knew the most believable lies are the closest to the truth, and I had to explain to my supervisor why I couldn’t go on patrol very well (shitty security job) as well as why I was limping. I told them (and other people later) that I was ironing naked. I said that the iron fell, and I tried to catch it against my body because I wasn’t thinking and didn’t want to burn my carpet. Everyone was so enthralled by the idea that I singed my twins that they didn’t question the how too much, and I’ve held this secret in shame ever since.

I healed up eventually, and I don’t think I have any lasting damage, luckily. Learned my lesson though. Some wrinkles aren’t meant to be ironed out.

tifu,"So this happened about an hour ago.

So I am on a work trip in San Diego, and I'm staying at a hotel. My work doesn't start until tomorrow so I figure I'll go out for a couple of drinks tonight, because fuck it, what else am I gonna do?

I go out at about 10pm and apparently everything closes at 11pm close to my hotel. Super lame. So I manage to only get one drink in. Not my idea of a good work trip.

I get back to my hotel and decide, the hell with it, I'm gonna go to the corner store and get some more beer to go and drink a couple of beers while enjoying the hot tub at the hotel.

As I'm walking back into the hotel lobby, 6 pack in hand, there's a young guy, close to my age (25-30) sitting in the lobby. He calls out to me ""Hey mate! How ya doing bud?"" (he sounded Australian or something) to which I reply, ""Good man, how are you?"" we exchange pleasantries, and since we're both dressed business casual, it just seems natural that we're both just two friendly dudes. After a minute of 'hey how ya doin' he asked if I have a room, to which I reply, 'of course'. He says ""Great well let's break open that six pack and start kicking back"". Meanwhile I'm thinking, cool, found a drinking buddy.

After a couple beers in the upstairs hangout area, he starts referring to me as Ian. My name is not Ian. Then he starts talking about some work shit that I know nothing about and inside work related drama, that again, I know nothing about. It immidiately clicks. This guy has been thinking this whole time, I'm the guy he is here to meet. From my friendly demeanor and me, just acting like I'm friends with everybody, it never clicked that we actually don't know each other and this guy was looking for his friend Ian to shoot the shit with, not me.

I politely apologize, and tell him he's confused me with someone else. He apologizes too and we both awkwardly part ways.

Life growing up wasn't hard my mom was a doctor so financially we were stable my grandma would take care of me and it was overall nice however my mom refused to ever talk about my dad all I knew is he was ""a tall son of a bitch"".

5 years ago I met the girl of my dreams. Long black hair a lovely face and an amazing body. She was the sweetest thing and seemed to understand me. She was 19 I was 24 but age didn't effect us. We met at a coffee shop she worked at I would come around 7, when they were about to close get coffee and talk with her as she closed shop. Soon enough I asked for her number she told me she wasn't aloud to give private info to customers so I waited till they closed walked out with her then asked her again. She agreed and we started talking more. Things went up from there we started dating I got close with her family she got close to mine and a year ago I proposed to her at the coffee shop we met at.

Wedding planning is a bitch I hated it it took about 4 months and during that time my mom got cancer and was put in a hospital. December 2018 we got married, skyped call the whole thing for my mom. And January 2019 my wonderful mother passed away. 

My wonderful supporting now wife was amazing throughout this all, we held the funeral and she kept me going and we held the funeral. This is where life took a turn. We were cleaning out the attic of her house preparing everything to sell. No big deal. Thats when I found a photo album from when my mom was in collage. I flipped through it and noticed something, a guy commonly with my mom..... Was my wifes dad. Shocked and stunned I approached my wife with it and she said we should talk to her dad about it. We go to him and he tells us about how he dated a girl in collage got her pregnant couldn't handle it and ""dissapeared"" to a different part of town. We explain to him how thats my mother and thats where this story leaves off, I'm grossed but my wife and I talked about it. Were going to try and stay together and never talk about this again.

tifu,"I was scrolling through various NSFW subreddits, and saw a picture that was in a living room that looked familiar. I was in disbelief, so I thought I’d check the profile just to assure myself that I was wrong. Sure enough, the profile picture had my sister’s face. Her bio is her trying to sell her Snapchat premium to interested men and women. She also appears to be a frequent poster on many various NSFW subreddits.

I don’t want to say anything to her because that is obviously super awkward, but I don’t know how I am ever going to look her in the face again given this discovery. I’m not judging in the sense that you gotta do what you gotta do to make some money, but you (hopefully) never want to think of your sister in this manner.

TLDR: I accidentally found my sister’s Reddit porn account, and I am sad.

Edit 1: I am aware of a similar, yet less damning, TIFU that was posted recently about a similar situation. This post is not a copy-cat and is a genuine “OMG FML” situation.

tifu,"I was visiting Chicago from New York and was waiting at a bus stop with my friend and a few strangers, and then one of the strangers was complaining loudly and explicitly about how the bus wasn't arriving on-time and then his friend pretended (at least now I think he was pretending) to throw up. He asked me if he could use my phone to make a call and so I gave it to him but then he took it and then bolted off very fast with his friend and I quickly lost sight of them (it was really dark outside, had really good athletic ability and were dark-skinned and wearing dark clothes). When I got to my friend's dorm about 20 minutes later, I locked my phone and contacted police to file a report. But still, even after doing this I constantly remember that I was dumb enough to hand over my phone to someone else because at the moment I thought I was trying to be a good person and now I feel really upset and can't stop thinking about this since I do have a bunch of personal info and experiences in it that I can't get back. I feel even more guilty knowing that the phone was pretty pricey and bought using my parents' money.

tifu," I was working from home yesterday and had to dial into a conference call at work. The participants of the conference call were my boss and his boss. During the conference call, my dad was texted me. My dad is not a texter, so I wanted to check and make sure everything was ok.  Fortunately, my dad was just letting me let me know he was going call me when he got out of his doctor's appointment.  I wasn't sure when that would be so I told him I was in the middle of a call and I'd call him later. While I'm sending the message, the conference call is wrapping up and we're saying our ""goodbyes"". My dad writes, ""ok - love you"". I -- in return -- say out loud (ON THE PHONE) "" I love you more. Talk soon."". The call went absolutely silent.   My boss is very no-nonsense and his boss is not from this country so any humor was lost during this unintentional declaration of love.  I tried to pass it off as ""oh -- sorry, I was talking to my dog"" - but even that didn't make sense.  I'm still feel dirty with cringe.

This obviously wasn't today, but 17 years ago. I was a young, 15 year old Will. And I had an on again off again middle school/high school sweetheart. 


One day, during our ""off again"" period, she had called me. She told me she was finally ready to lose her virginity and to come over the next afternoon while her parents were out. I, a horny teenager, whole-heartedly jumped at the chance. The next day I jumped on my old trusty mongoose mountain bike and rode my bike to my work (a now defunct drug store). There I purchased condoms from my boss. I proceeded to ride my bike 5 miles across town. I was determined.


I get to the house, we are both nervous and make some awkward small talk. She asked if I wanted to play a CD. I can't remember if it was me or her but we ended up choosing Good Charlotte, as the album was new at the time. Yes, I lost my virginity to Good Charlotte.


We did the deed, which was probably pretty mediocre for the both of us. Seeing as how we were both nervous virgins I couldn't imagine it being good for her. Now on to the fuck up.


After the deed, I put my used condom in her bathroom trashcan. She said she would grab it later and put it in the big trashcan outside. I was getting ready to go home when her dad showed up with her little sister. He was used to seeing me at their house so he gave me a standard greeting and asked what we had been doing. I politely replied I had come over to swim. While we were having our conversation her dog had walked out of the room, condom in mouth. The dog proceeded to take the purple prophylactic and drop it at her dad's feet. To this day, I swear the dog knew and was trying to out me. 


Her dad noticed and asked her directly ""what's this"", pointing at the used rubber. I looked at him and said as fast as I possibly could ""that's my time Mr. Greene, seeyalaterbye!"" I literally ran out the back door, hopped on my bike and rode off into the sunset.

tifu,"I feel like such an asshole and an idiot at the same time. I can't believe my stupidity has gone this far. I only realized today that the binder my parents threw away had my expensive calculator inside the right pocket. My job was to remove it, but I was a lazy ass and I didn't take it out. My parents had no idea that a calculator was in there, and assumed that all the import stuff was taken out, but that doesn't cover up the fact that this is all my fault.

I work in a hospital and at the time there was a policy that we needed to remove bandages from patients with *Osteomyelitis of the foot before carrying out my job. 

*Osteomyelitis is a nasty infection of the bone that can result in ulcers and necrotic tissue. 

In limps my next patient, a very pleasant middle aged lady and we got down to the task at hand. She was complaining things were hurting more than usual but it didn't seem like anything too bad as she was managing to get about okay. 

So I got her on the table and started removing the bandages as I had done many times but this time it was different... They seemed to come off a lot easier than usual and then when I got right to the big toe IT JUST FELL APART. About half of the big toe including all of what remained of the nail came with the bandage. Incredibly the patient who was lying down at the time could neither see or feel my impromtu toe-ectomy. I panicked. I was new to the job and nothing like this had ever happened before. So I did what any reasonable human would do and I gathered it all up in the dressings and put it in the bin.

After doing what I needed to do I reapplied some 'fresh' bandages and sent the patient on her merry way, blissfully unaware of her recent amputation.

tifu,"Obligatory didn't happen today, more like fall 2017.

I was working as a server in a steakhouse that was connected to the lobby of a hotel.  The place wasn't super fancy but it had a decent wine selection and was one of the nicer places in the area.

Anyway, it was a normal Friday night around 10:30 and the night was winding down.  There were a few tables that were hanging out in the dining room and my only table left was a couple who were only a few years older than I (I was 26 at the time, they were probably early 30's).  Since it was slow and I was tired and I wanted to delay starting my sidework I decided to hang around their table and chat.  After asking where their from, how long they're staying in the area, yadda yadda the topic of conversation shifted to wine.

I am not a wine guy.  I'm a beer drinker through and through.  But, as a server in a steakhouse with a respectable wine list it was our job to be knowledgeable enough to make recommendations  and have solid basic knowledge so that you don't completely embarrass yourself (and the restaurant) when the customers ask.  At this point I'd been a server for a little over a year so I was starting to get pretty cocky talking about different wineries and vintages and shit that I didn't really know but could play off.

So they're asking me about the different wines on the menu and after a brief pause, the guy looks at me and asks, ""Do you sell magnums here?"".  Before taking a second to think, I respond ""Nah, but you can try the front desk of the hotel.""

My horny ass 26 year old brain assumed that the nice couple enjoying their Friday night just asked me if we sell condoms. At the restaurant. I didn't realize that magnum is an extra large bottle of wine.  

Him and his girlfriend take a split second to give me a confused look, just long enough for my face to go beet red.  Then they look at each other and start chuckling and shaking their heads.  Not ready to face the idiocy that just came out of my mouth, I wish them a good rest of their night and make a beeline for the back.

Later that night, as we were locking up, I told my manager the story.  He was just about crying from laughter.  He was also the sommolier at the restaurant and he had never heard that happening before.  He didn't let me forget it, but I ended up quitting in the spring and moving to a new state (for different reasons, lol).

tifu,"Long story short we were trying to study(we are both kinda strangers as it’s our first and only time trying to study together) but instead we ended up taking about all kinds of things. Honestly it was fun and I hope that it was mutual. But today I fucked up. 

At some point they mentioned someone but I didn’t catch it for some reason. Keeping it short a mentor for a club. 

Fast forward to today and basically she tells me that she cleared her schedule to study with insert name name of mentor. 

But here is the fuck up.... my dumbass says idk who that (insert name) is.

Then she says that she mentioned him yesterday. 

Then I say ohh fuck I forgot and I’m sorry it’s just that I’m really busy and we talked about so many things that I simply forgot. And in all honesty I did. 

I’m so embarrassed as it’s a bad first impression and not gonna lie I’m not trying to fuck it up with this person. I know that came off in bad way because they always save messages and they haven’t left me on read till today and they didn’t save my apology. 

Honestly I’m way to embarrassed to hit them up anymore even though I would like to have them as a friend at least and I don’t want to come off in a bad way as I’ve already sent them two problems that we were stuck on. 

How bad did I fuck up?

 Our teacher, let's call him Laurence Fishburn (because thats who everyone says he looks like) assigned groups for projects on the human body and my group had the muscular system.

The project itself was pretty easy. Made a PowerPoint with pictures on the slides giving information on them and yada yada yada. 

The thing is, way earlier before the project was assigned I downloaded a very nsfw video to my Google Drive. This is because the week following we'd have no internet so I needed something to satisfy my needs. You know where this is going.

So fast forward to the day we present, I had completely forgot about said video and the PowerPoint was saved to my account but I'd sent a copy to a friend who I was presenting with. The previous person used Google Drive to pull up their presentation while mine was in my Gmail off Google Slides. And when I logged in it went straight to my Drive and there it was.....

tifu,"So, today was a religious holiday where I'm from, and naturally theres tons of discounts on everything from food chains to clothes etc etc. What struck me as  the most appealing was a Pizza Hut deal where they were giving out free medium and small pizzas if you buy a large one, it was all in IIRC $13 including some taxation. Me being the pizza muncher got all amped up and got my friend to tag along. He asked me if I could give him the medium one for $6, though I insisted on the small one for $3 but wasn't actually gonna accept it since obv he's my friend and I care about his feelings, but as it turns out, I don't - at least not as much as I care about the Pizza. Pizza's the one thing I care about the most, and never ever would I share it with anyone even if they offer me loads of $ or anything. Almost as if I weirdly bond with it to the point of becoming a Pizza obsessed narcissist, if that makes any sense. So, I get the Pizzas and obviously give him the small one and return him the $3 that he paid me, he kept insisting for the medium one with a puppy face and even more money. Also, mind you that the nearest PH is 7km away so I couldn't really go back, and had already used up my Uber credit to get there. So yeah that's pretty much it, but he got pretty upset that his best friend would value a Pizza over our friendship.

A little backstory: As a kid I moved around a lot because of my parents' job, because of this we would often move to different areas with different cultures, customs, and dialects. I grew up in Northern Virginia (shoutout to the DMV area), but this time around we lived in South Dakota.

It was summertime before my senior year and I was in dire need of cash monies. So I as a reasonable, highschool-aged, young adult, got a job at my local grocery store as a courtesy clerk (basically a jack of all trades worker) for the summer. 

It was an ordinary day of bagging groceries, pushing carts and stocking shelves. I was stocking shelf when a woman comes up to me asking where the Pops were. I was still fairly new but I was getting familiar with the store layout, so I was feeling confident I could help this woman find her Pops.

Without hesitation, I turn around and with a smile ask her to follow me as I show her where to find the Pops. We walk about an aisle or two over before we arrive at the breakfast aisle, I show the woman to the Corn Pops cereal. I pick out a box, telling her we have either value or family sized. She gives me an impatient smile followed by chuckling. ""This is a joke right?"" she asks with a raised eyebrow. ""Nope, this is the real deal"" I reply with slight sarcasm. 

With a slight look of annoyance the woman asks again where she can find the pops. I was confused, was I being pranked right now? I spend a couple seconds thinking before asking her if she can name any brand in particular. ""Coke, You know what coke is right?"" she replies with a worrying amount of sarcasm.

It hits me. 
My heart drops. 
I cringe internally at what I had just done.

""Ooh, you mean pop as in soda pop"" I reply. ""Yes, exactly"" says the woman now turning to walk away. I apologize for my cluelessness before waking her to the soda aisle. I ask her if she needed anything else before returning to work in confusion and embarrassment. 

Later that day, a quick google search revealed to me that ""pop"" is what people call soda in the Midwest. 

I am from the east coast.

I had just started learning about jerking off and was watching an episode of Black Mirror. The whole premise was people were living in a simulation and having relationships with a set time limit(aka mostly one night stands). Well there were multiple explicit scenes and my willy was getting excited. I finished the episode and went to the shower for some alone time. 

Cue the fuck up. I got some lotion and started putting sperm banks out of business. The water was hot but my Johnny was hotter. I didn’t have any visuals so I was just imagining a hot chick I was with at the time. Well I kept the lube flowing and nothing was happening. I whack and hack like an adventurer in a forest but I can’t feel anything. Then there’s a release. My vision turns fuzzy and my hearing shuts off. I look down and the ol’ pipe is beet red and erupting like Mt St Helens. But my hand has a mind of its own, pumping away like an oil tycoon in Texas. So here I am sitting on the floor of my shower, semen on my leg, dick blood red, I can’t hear or see. The only thing linking me to the outside world is my hand going up and down like an indecisive fish on a hook. Then I black out.

I wake up still spanking it like a nun in a room full of obnoxious brats. I come to my senses(mentally, still can’t hear and my vision is fuzzy) and attempt to stand up. Not the brightest move. I fall out of the shower and hit my head on the tile. At least I’m not waterboarding myself. I wake up again and stumble out of the bathroom like a college freshman after his first night of drinking. I make it about as far as the door and lose my balance, cascading into a wooden dresser. I’m a whirlwind of self destruction. I wake up AGAIN and crawl onto a chair and try to gain my bearings. I have no clue what to do, and I have to act inconspicuous as I walk back to my side of the house. Somehow managed to do it unnoticed, and lie in bed regretting my existence for a considerable amount of time. I look at the clock and it’s 2:45. I walked into the shower at 11. I went to the bathroom, threw up and got dressed to go to my girlfriends birthday get together with her entire family. I forgot her gift(fuck up number two) and as the night goes on she gets more distant. I’m out of sorts at this point and can barely function. I go home and sleep for 17 hours straight.

I'll keep this short! My SO and I sometimes take naps after I get back from work around 4pm. I usually leave for work at 5:30am. We also have a roommate who leaves MUCH earlier and is usually sleeping when he gets back at 5pm. 

Today, we laid down to take a nap once I got home. 

When I woke up, the light slipping through the blinds was very faint. I checked my phone and it was 5:50. I immediately jumped out of bed and started running around grabbing my stuff for work, furiously getting dressed and thinking great, now I'll be stuck in traffic (the DC area is awful). My SO wakes up from me throwing everything around to ask me if I want to go the gym. I snap back ""NO I literally have to go to work, I'm late"".

When I get into the kitchen to grab my lunch, I just get mad upset. I can't believe that I slept for so long and basically am going to work after just being there. It's been stressful so at this point I'm bawling my eyes out. I'm putting my shoes on, grabbing my bag and about to head out the door when my SO wanders out of the room to attempt to console me. I'm having none of it. He asks why I'm going to work, to me, the answer is obvious. ""It's 6:00 I'm late"".

I find a perfect August Ames video and head to the bathroom. Our office bathroom is a single bathroom for 1 person at a time only.

tifu,"Throwaway account.
Explaining everything would take too long, even if I wanted to detail it all. Okay, let me start.

This all started in mid-February 2018 and the consequences of my actions still echo until today. I will try to keep it simple by sorting it into a list of events.

**1. Started off the year with an abortion**

I was fresh out of a mutually abusive relationship. I will name her Girl A. I was just hanging out with some girls who were interesting to me and checking if one of them would be interested in having a relationship with me. The other two are irrelevant to this story, but one of them, Girl B, was... Too thirsty. On my third encounter with her, we got drunk. And she... Got horny and insisted I had sex with her in public. I said it wasn't a good idea many times, but she kept on insisting and I obliged. Still, before we could have any action, I just said it hurt because of the position and she accepted that excuse to stop. Crisis averted!
No! A month later she comes to my workplace to tell me the news, privately. Girl A, my ex, gathers enough info about how to get a procedure. And I ask for her help. They fight when we talk about it and now Girl B doesn't even want to look at my face.
For the next month or so, we go back and forth discussing about having the procedure, which wrecked both of us emotionally (me, financially, too, but I didn't want to emphasize this). By the end of March 2018, she has the procedure and we both go our own ways, but we still have each other's numbers and Facebook.
After this event, I got back with Girl A and we actually have a very nice year as a couple. That is, until December, but before I get to that...

**2. Asking nudes while drunk to my best (at the time) friend's gf**

I present to you, Girl C, the main axis of the story. She is a GREAT person, in which I saw very few flaws, and (still) girlfriend of my best friend. I don't exactly remember the occasion, but getting wasted with Girl A was a common occurrence.
So, we both get drunk and go home to sleep. I talk to Girl C using Girl A's phone to tell her we were at home and alive, but I do so by roleplaying as Girl A. My very dumb and drunk self asks for nudes from her. We chat a bit and I fall asleep. The next day, Girl A wakes up to see that strange conversation on her phone and demands I apologize to both of them. Which I do, because I know that is only proper and I was an ass.
Until them, all is well.

**3. I grope a girl's butt because I thought she would see no harm in it**

Girls A and D come to my house to drink and we start to be sexually playful. At one point, there was a group kiss and Girls A and D making out. Girl D needs to go home and we offer ourselves to keep her company. On the way there, thinking she will only find it playful, I grope her butt. Just so you know, I don't try to hide from Girl A, but she didn't notice. You see, I already made out with Girl D before and I thought that I could do this due to the sexual tension from before.
I was wrong. Girl D doesn't want to see me anymore after that night. Until months later she demands I apologize, which I do, because it is only proper, even if I tried to explain my logic behind the act that night.

**4. I, wrongfully, think a girl was just postponing her plans to going out with me**

See, when I got back with Girl A, we kept an open relationship after a night I was out with a bisexual friend, Girl E. It will come up later.
To keep it short, I meet another GREAT girl, Girl F, and I ask her out, explaining I am in an open relationship. To which she replies ""I am fresh out of a relationship, so I am just not in the mood right now"". My shitty brain matter (ergo ME) thinks she would like to give it a go at a later date, instead of interpreting it as a dismissal.
One day, while talking to Girl F, I say I think a friend might want to go out with her and I am kind of jealous. She gets it now, that I still think of her as a possible friend with benefits and gives me a straight up NO. I am not mad, I just say she should have been more explicit the first time and I didn't even tried to ask her out again, which I had in mind for a near future. Okay, okay. I got a little mad, reinforcing she should be more explicit with men from now on, because men don't get a clue. She says I am annoying for pointing this out to her and we go our separate ways, until...
My best friend - at the time - tells me she has spread our online conversation among my friend group. Then and there, I get pissed off and tell her to never do that again.

**5. Because my friend kissed me one night, I, drunk, think it is okay to ask her for another kiss**

To give you a broader view. I know Girl E since 2017, but, because she thought I was hitting on her gf at the time, she didn't want to see me anymore. Until May 2018, when rumours spread that she is having suicidal thoughts and many of her friends are worrying about her. I go to her house, because no one can get in touch with her, but she is okay and asks me if I would like to go to a party with her, which I do, because she feels lonely. I help her hook up with another girl who became her fiancee later on. That night, I asked Girl A if I could make out with some random boy in the party and she gave me a pass.
Little did I know, at the time, she didn't want to and she cried all night long.
The next day, she tells me this and proposes to open the relationship, which I accept and even helped her hook up with some boys later on.
Okay, the important part is: one night, Girl A, Girl E, her fiancee and I are at the beach drinking with many friends when it evolves into a beach make out party. Girl E kissed me then - which later on she revealed was just because whe wanted to open her relationship with her fiancee, which was having none of it.
Days pass and we are drinking at Girl E's house when I ask her for a kiss. She just denied it and we kept on drinking. The other day, though, she fights with me over it, which I promptly tell my best friend. That's when hell ensues.

**6. Girl C convinces my entire friend circle to ostracize me**

Look, I don't hate her, neither her boyfriend, but I find it really upsetting that she would keep people she thinks of as shitty friends, but ostracize me. Because my best friend told her I got into a fight with Girl E, Girl C thought it was enough bad stories (from Girl A to Girl F) from me and that it would be best if we cut ties without warning.
I don't even know, nor bother knowing why I can't contact her anymore, until my best friend tells me why. ""Tell her I don't mind if she needs a time alone and I hope she feels better soon"", I tell him.
You see, I really didn't mind the idea of not having my close friends for a while as I study and work, but there was one person who minded it, Girl A. Girl A doesn't study nor work, even if I provided her with opportunities, and she doesn't have her ""own"" friend circle, so, when my friends got away, she felt alone. And cried and suffered and said she didn't like the situation as it was.
One day, she does on social media to rant about the situation in my friend circle and deletes herself - from virtual existence. As I don't like to see Girl A sad, I talk to my friends about it, but they didn't bulge PLUS they block me.

**7. I threaten to kill myself with fire**

It was december. The day they blocked me was the same day I knew they were going to make a party, so I discuss with Girl A that I am fed up with them for making her sad and, although she tries to deter me at first, she lets me go there to talk to Girl C and friends personally.
Afraid of getting there just to be ignored, I decide I must shock them by suicide attempt. Man, my mind was so clear. I don't think I have ever felt as clear of mind and certain of purpose to this day.
Keeping it short: I buy alcohol, matches and potato chips - to seem less suspicious, I guess - and go there. My best friend opens the door, alerts me, but lets me in. Then and there, I pour alcohol over me and threaten to light myself on fire.
Best friend and other two deter me as fast as they can and push me out of the house to talk to me. We talk about everything here and more. Girl C gives me a hug, but says she will not back down, making that the final nail in the coffin of my social circle.
I am okay with that, really. All I really wanted was to be able to talk to them one last time, telling them ""I don't mind if you don't want to see me anymore after this, as long as it means you will be happy"".
But Girl A wasn't happy with that. She told me she was ashamed of being my girlfriend and siding with me, even though I only did it because of her sadness, in a way. And that was the final nail in the coffin of our relationship. It kept on degrading until she hooked up with a friend of ours, preferring to go out with him even when we were trying to meet on the weekends. Then, we gave it an end.

tl;dr: Lost half of my social circle and a girlfriend of 6 years because of bad events involving alcohol and my shitty logic.",TIFU by being an unintentional asshole to all of my friends
tifu,"Okay so this didn't happen today but I'd say it's about 1-2 years ago since it happend. Hope that's okay. And just to get that out of the way; I'm male, and gay. And now you're gonna hear about how I explained myself in this horrible situation.  


So it was probably some kind of vacation, because that's about the only time I see my cousin (male cousin that is). And as ""kids"" do during the vacation; we played games. So as I was playing something on TV I guess, I gave my phone to my cousin, for him to play on. Without even thinking about all the.... naked stuff... in my gallery and internet browser.  


And as you may have guessed by now; he found it. And as if that wasn't enough, that fuckin moron showed it to everyone in the room asking me loudly (but with no parents around, just our fellow brothers/cousins) why I had huge dicks on my phone. I very fast grabbed my phone and served them the explanation that ""well you obviously need a guy in the porn, did you think the women were fu\*\*ing themselves?"" They probably didn't believe the explaination, at least not the oldest of them, but who cares, I'm out and proud now anyways.  


TL;DR  
I gave my phone full of porn to my cousin so he could play games and he found the ""nasty pictures"" and confronted me about it in front of my relatives.

tifu,"TIFU by putting the right type of random shit in a box. This actually happened a few hours ago.

I started dating my girlfriend about a year and a half ago. Her mother had passed away (Cancer) when we started seeing each other, so timing wasn't that great. However what drew me to her was how level headed she was about the whole ordeal.

It impressed me so much more that after 3 or 4 months of dating, I asked for her to move in with me and she said yes. I was exhausted driving 1.5 hours with traffic to spend time with her each day.

Of the next few months, we both expressed how we would love to go to space and live on Mars. I took her to see some rocket launches up close and whenever our schedules allowed, we made it a past time to watch them.

Due to recent food allergies I developed, we had gotten really good at food prepping and making each other meals.

Her and I are very much into fitness, for her, it was yoga that she enjoys most and I jump in once a week to help with recovery.

Bare with me, all of this is related. 

So tonight, we were celebrating with some friends on our move to a new studio. The girlfriend had a bit too much wine. We decided to visit our old apartment in order to get some left over gear that we had not been able to pack up.

We get to the apartment and she stumbles to hand over this very nice box. I asked her why she is handing it to me. And she asked me if it means anything to me.

The box is a fancy Christmas box with Santa Claus on the outside. Inside is an [old woot video game themed Valentines Day shirt](https://shirt.woot.com/offers/player-2-a-love-story?ref=cnt_ctlg_dgn_3), along with space yoga pants, a space lunch box, and an Apollo photo book titled, ""One Giant Leap""

I casually mentioned that these were gifts I got last year or the year prior from family that I just kept in a box. The valentines shirt was something I bought long ago for myself. She was insistent that the art design came out last year, I told her it was way longer than that. 

Girlfriend starts crying. Hysterically. We are talking uncontrollable sobs between incoherent ramblings. This is beyond normal drunken cries. These are otherworldly.

Finally she wailed, ""I'M SO DUMB!""

I reassured her that she was being hard on herself and that I have dumb shit but it doesn't mean I'm dumb. 

Nothing I said or did helped.

I learned slowly through the tears that this mysterious box appeared after 3 Kings Day and she believed it was an elaborate plan for me to propose to her on the 50th Anniversary of Apollo 11 Landing on the Moon; July 20th.

She found a lot of symbolism in the combination of items. She truly thought I was different and amazing for planning things so far ahead of time. When she refuses to believe that I had inherited gifts and extra gear from my old home during the holidays. 

She even mentioned this box to other friends. And is embarrassed to the point where she wants to leave me and end the relationship. We just started a lease at a new place.

I was able to find [proof of the old woot tshirt being from 2010](https://www.destructoid.com/give-your-loved-ones-this-really-tacky-gamer-shirt-162528.phtml). However she is passed out next to me and I hope to see her after work tomorrow and not an abandoned apartment.

BTW - We are supposed to go to a friend's wedding this weekend.

TL;DR - My girlfriend confused a box full of old gifts, as gifts to announce a proposal to her. She was sadden that none of it is related to her and felt humiliated. She wants to leave the relationship.",TIFU by hoarding random shit in a box
tifu,"Obligatory did not happen today. This happened two months ago.

A bit of background first. I have parents that live separately from each other. (I live with my mom) One day, my dad, along with his girlfriend, took me and my sister on a week-long trip to Japan.

Anyway, on to the FU. As I was about to brush my teeth before going to bed, I found my dad's girlfriend's Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush on the hotel's amenity tray. My 14-year old dumbass thought that this was the hotel's toothbrush, considering Japan is a progressive and advanced AF country. I then began to acquaint myself with the toothbrush, playing around with its various modes. The vibrations it made were absolutely immense that if it were to be used as a vibrator, I imagine it would have a girl orgasming in no time. Anyway, I used it, and eventually concluded that this was the best toothbrush I've ever used.

For the following couple of days, I used this toothbrush to brush my teeth. Until one morning, when we were preparing ourselves for a day in Akihabara, my dad saw me brushing my teeth with his girl's Sonicare. ""Hey GarrixerinIdolHell, that's not your toothbrush!"" he immediately said. I asked whose toothbrush it was, and he went on to explain that it was his girl's toothbrush and that she was wondering why it was wet and why was the cover missing whenever she would go to brush her teeth. Honestly I felt like shit since I just shared saliva from someone that is not even related to me at all. I did apologize to her and they thought it was a bit funny. After that we spent our day in Akiba, like I said before, and boy, were there eyes and minds blown.

TL;DR: I used the Sonicare of my dad's girlfriend thinking it was the hotels, then I discovered that I have been sharing saliva with someone who is unrelated to me",TIFU by using the electric toothbrush of my dad's girlfriend
tifu,"I have a healthy libido folks, and I never know when the mood will strike. I was playing some CKII the other week and one of the portraits made me horny so I clicked over to reddit for some good fapping leads. As the saying goes, those who fail to plan, plan to fail, and I definitley failed to plan. As I was getting close, I had about three options: shoot on my shirt, the floor, or something/anything within reach.

Being a human and not an animal (I'm looking at you David) I chose the third, namely a piece of printer paper. Here's where I made my biggest mistake. I used my left hand to reach to the printer located to the right of me (my right hand was occupado) and as I brought the paper across and down in a hormone induced flourish, I misjudged the location of my dick and, you guessed it, sliced the side-ish bottom of my dick open (about 5 o'clock if that helps to imagine. It was quite an odd sensation, and although painful, I didn't fully realize what had happened until the blood started oozing onto the paper. I of course immediately imagined an ER trip with a half sliced-off dick and freaked the fuck out and nearly passed out in a panic.

Lucky for me, upon further inspection it was just a flesh (😏) wound, and though quite painful for many days, it healed up nicely with only a shadow of a scar. So kids, if you use paper to shoot your loads onto, be careful not to slice your dicks off!

Happened about four days ago. And it’s really scary thinking about it.
I had a Samsung s7 for two years. Best phone I could ever ask for. Battery started dying in 1 hr it would go from 30% to 0% in ten seconds and die. My mom told me I could buy another phone on her but i felt way too bad because she offers me money even if she doesn’t have at the time so I checked battery replacements.. $60 for my phone not bad right but I got the bright idea of doing it myself. Bought the battery off eBay for like seven dollars and it came with the kit. So me being an engineering student decided hey this is easy as fuck after watching a few videos.

For the s7 you have to take off 12 screws after getting the back piece off. The kit it came with gave me so much trouble and essentially unscrewing shit. After two days of looking for the kit for precision screws and nonstop returning we found one at Home Depot that worked properly. Ok. I’m unscrewing the screws as we drive home and the last one is stuck of course. We stop at a gas station and after the gas is pumped I finally get the last one out. The last step is to remove the battery that’s glued. My dumbass self decided instead of using a credit card to scoop it out I would use the same precision screwdriver instead. As we drive off I end up poking a hole in the battery and I think nothing of it. I forgot to turn my phone off during the whole process and I feel it getting hotter in my hand. It hits a point where I can’t hold it anymore and right as we leave smoke and fire come out the battery. There was so much freaking smoke I threw the phone out of the window as fast as I could.It happened so fast and we were only seconds away from the gas station so I can’t imagine the fumes in the air if I would’ve threw it out the window. It makes me shake thinking that I could be dead or in jail right now because there was so much freaking smoke t was crazy.

tifu,"Did not happen today, but the beautiful weather just shook the memory out of wherever I had it deeply hidden in my brain.

Two summers ago I was on the way to the beach with a few friends. They would be drinking but I don’t really drink, so on the way I took an edible. Then immediately forgot I took it because of course I did. 

We arrive, we’re running around in the waves, everyone is having a good time. We’re kind of bodysurfing, kind of just smacking our bodies against the waves and riding them in. I grew up on the water so I usually have Toddlers in Tiaras level confidence when swimming, but of course, there’s nothing the ocean likes to do more than teach a lesson to cocky inebriated idiots. 

So I start getting knocked down and can’t get back up. It feels like out of a movie; a big wave would crash and pull me under, I’d have a moment to almost regain my footing and take a big gulping breath, but before I could recover I’d be knocked over again. I started to panic - I watch too much Bondi Rescue, people way stronger than me get dragged under all the time, and I could almost hear the confessional: “looked like she knew what she was doing, but she just went under (snap) like that.”

Before I resort to screaming, I give it one more try with all my energy. I throw my body towards the shore, not even trying to stand up anymore, just trying to get somewhere shallower. If I could just get out of the break I’d be FINE. 

Yes, the break. Turns out I was max 10 feet from the shoreline, getting thrown around in water that went up to my mid thigh. Don’t worry, it gets worse.

I’m FINALLY standing on the sand, truly just happy to be alive. I take a few breaths to calm myself down and look around the beach, just repeating in my head that I’m fine and nothing happened. However something feels weird, why does my stomach feel all bunchy and tight? Looking down I realize: because of course I wore a strapless suit, and OF COURSE it was dropped around my tummy, boobs out for the whole world to see. Grand. 

I fix my swimsuit and go back to the towels, done with the water for the day. Laying out, I notice the sky is particularly beautiful, and the clouds are moving way faster than usual. It should relax me, but I have the sad Bondi Rescue confessional in my head again: “what you need to be worried about is Dry Drowning. She probably thought she was fine when she got back to the towel.” I half convinced myself that the water in my brain and/or lungs was twisting my perception, also why did I feel so calm? Was it my body accepting its fate? Friends return to the towels, I ask if they saw anything - of course they didn’t, the one woman mellow drama was all in my head, in reality the whole thing was quiet and quick. I explain the sky and the water and the dry drowning, and that I feel OK but “you guys NEED to keep an eye on me, I just want you to know what happened in case I pass out for no reason or something...”

“Didn’t you eat a weed rice krispie treat on the way over?”

tifu,"I live in Los Angeles, where parking tickets as common as Botox in a celebrity's face. My apartment doesn't have on-site parking, so I had to buy a permit to park on my street and surrounding streets. If you park in the area without a permit, you get a parking ticket that's \~$60.

&amp;#x200B;

The permit is large and hangs from your rearview mirror (like a handicap permit). I had gotten two parking tickets in the past few months even though I had a valid permit. One was because the parking officer thought my permit was expired (which it wasn't), and the other was because I had forgotten to put my permit on my mirror after a day at work.

&amp;#x200B;

I had an administrative hearing this morning to contest these two parking tickets. It is a nice day, so I decided to walk to the hearing. Plus, I had gotten a good spot in front of my building and didn't want to lose it. I took my permit with me so I could prove it was valid and walked to the hearing.

&amp;#x200B;

The hearing took about a half hour because of all types of paperwork. After the hearing, I decided to treat myself to a coffee for the walk home. The line at the coffee shop was long, but I wasn't in a rush.

tifu,"So! I (16F) got a Taco Bell gift card from my father last Easter. Having not used it yet, I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to go to Taco Bell after school. After he said no (who turns down free Taco Bell?!) I decided I’d go by myself. 

I walked the three blocks to Taco Bell and when I opened the door I dragged it across my foot completely DESTROYING my toe.

Some really nice guy helped me out. He got me napkins and got the kitchen staff to give me a band-aid (useless but his heart was in the right place). He even offered to buy me food and get me an uber home but I rejected and told him I was fine.

My mom came and picked me up and figured, her being a doctor, she could clean it up and fix the situation a little. She took one look at my toe and immediately told me to get my wallet (for ID and Insurance) because we had to rush to urgent care.

We got there and they cleaned it and glued it together. I had completely torn my nail from back to front. All the tissue from under my nail had seeped up. When they glued the injury all the tissue got glued into place. Now I have a cool looking, disgusting toe and can’t dance pointe for 4 months.

Background:

I grew up hard in a family that moved a lot.  I learned to make friends and create my own family, adopting bonus siblings and parents, wherever I go.  I say ""I love you"" to people I care about. Also, I'm newly out as pansexual and I'm in the middle of leaving a heteronormative marriage because my husband abused me. 

I met the most incredible woman, Alice, as I started the journey of healing from abuse and leaving my marriage.  I feel an immense amount of gratitude for her drawing on her own experience with trauma to support me and hold space for me to work through some serious shit.  She once told me she isn't comfortable saying ""I love you"".  We had a good talk, and I thought I understood that she doesn't mind me saying it, she's just not going to say it back. 

I also have a BFF, Jan, who is so much more than a best friend.  She's been my sister for than a decade. She moves a lot, too, and we get together whenever we can. 

Jan and Alice are both happily married to men.  They are also both strong allies and support for me. 



On to the FU:  

Jan came to visit and I planned an afternoon to hang out with her and Alice.  I had told Jan about Alice, but I wanted her to emphasize how important she was to me.  When I introduced them I said, ""If I were ever going to marry a woman, it would be Alice."" 

Jan answered, ""So, she's your ohf_ck."" I asked what she meant and Jan said if she was ever going to marry a woman it would be me. 

The afternoon went well.  We did pampering stuff and talked for hours.  Life got busy. Jan went home.  Alice and I made a few playdates for our kids, but the two of us haven't hung out much. 

Alice called tonight.  We talked a few minutes before I had to care for a child emergency.  I ended the call, ""I love you.""  I called back after resolving the issue, and Alice didn't answer.  

She texted me a while later and shared that she isn't comfortable recieving ""I love you"".  She also shared she hasn't reached out to me because of how uncomfortable she has been due to the way I introduced her to Jan. And she misses me. 

We're working it out.  Alice clearly expressed what she felt, including what makes her uncomfortable with ""I love you"" in general.  I heard her more clearly and confirmed we understand each other.  

She worked through a lot to ask me to understand her and honor her needs.  Hopefully, we saved our friendship through communication.

tifu," Ok, obligatory this happened several years ago. I used to live in the little mountain town where the beer flows like wine and the women flock like the salmon of copastrano. You know, a little town called Aspen. Aspen has a farmer's market over the summer, on Saturdays. They also have an air raid siren that goes off at noon every day. It is on top of the fire station and was originally used to let the miners know when it is lunch time - it goes off at the crack of noon every day. I have always said that one day I want to joke with someone who isn't familiar with the siren that if it goes off, there's a problem and we need to get to shelter - the siren is that loud and realistic.

One summer my step brother came to town with his wife and we took them all around town, including the charming farmer's market. Hardly any farmers and lots of people selling art and over priced oils and pasta.

We were walking through the market and all of a sudden I heard it. That blaring, unmistakable noon-time siren starting blaring in all of its WWII glory... and at the very moment it went off everything came together in my head. I had forgotten about pulling this prank, and right at that moment, without pre-planning anything with my wife, I looked over at my step brother and, completely straight-faced without cracking a smile, I turned to the right and said ""We to go... we have to go NOW."" I immediately turned and started speed walking towards a building and glanced back at my step brother...

His face went from relaxed and enjoying himself to stone cold focused, looking at his surrounding for an exit and a place to shelter. He stopped in his tracks and was as focused as an eagle on a rabbit. He searched for what felt like minutes... Then I started laughing, we all laughed, and I had exacted my revenge from when we were kids.

Here's the thing... As I turned and told him we had to go, go now, and he got his laser focus on his surroundings, I remembered that he used to be in the coast guard. No big deal, except that his current line of work was working over seas in Afghanistan as a security contractor. I forgot he had recently been in a place where the air raid sirens meant incoming mortars, not lunch time! I scared the crap out of him, it was actually amazing to see the change in his face when his instinct and training took over; you could literally see the change.

So, yeah, into him back and spooked the crap out of a former military man! Thankfully he is family and not some stranger! Guess I should think about the prank before implementing! Just happy he doesn't suffer from PTSD!

tifu,"This definitely happened, and it was definitely today, maybe about 6 hours ago.

I should start by saying that today was day #3 into a new job in the healthcare field. I've wanted to land this job for a long time. It's great pay and benefits, and it's a perfect avenue to nurture my professional interests

I only had two other coworkers in the office with me today. One is our front desk gal, freshly back from maternity leave after her first child. The other is another practitioner (like me) that is transferring to this location from another branch, and just started at this office the week before I did. We all get along pretty well together professionally and personality-wise, and I happen to be the only male in the office today.

Towards the end of the day I was telling a story about a piece of training equipment we'd used in school to assess, document and care for various types of wounds we might see on patients. So these fake wounds were spread all over a fake, disembodied butt and hips (which are common areas for skin breakdown and wounds). I remembered that it was jokingly named [Seymour Butts](https://www.suprememed.com/model-seymour-butts-wound-care), but I add on ""...model"" to my search since it's a practice model for wound care. And all this took place on MY computer at MY desk.

Well... today I got to learn that Seymour Butts is also the name of an American porn actor, as evidenced by the multiple pictures of naked women in a variety of poses and degrees of... engagement. They both saw, were a little shocked, and then laughed it off. I joked about having made it ""three whole days. We had a good run, y'all. See ya."" So no real harm done.

TL,DR: tried to find a picture of clinical education equipment, instead found action shots of a porn star by the same name, all in front of my female coworkers at a brand-new job.

&amp;#x200B;

MT: Math Teacher

&amp;#x200B;

F: My idiot best friend

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Moisturised Egg

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: I came to school in shorts, and my french teacher doesn't like that. So she sent me home to change. I did that in about 20 mins, and came back to school. I brought my shorts back so I would change when the class is over. The pants that I changed into were training pants, so if I wanted to change I didn't have to untie my shoes and take them off. I was in the back of the class, in a pair of boxers, shoes and my t-shirt. A desk was next to me, and my shorts were on the desk. F sees me, and decides to take my shorts and run off. Then as my autism kicks in, I decide to chase him down the hall, in a pair of boxers (my school is a 3 story building, and my class is on the 3rd floor, and teachers don't usually go there). After not much running I decide to go back to the class and wait for him. He comes back and returns the shorts, and I change. Then everything goes normal, until the math class.

&amp;#x200B;

Math class also goes normal, until I get called to the blackboard. F starts laughing, and MT tells him that she knows why he's laughing and then asked me if the me running in boxers is real. I tell her yes. Also MT didn't know that F took my shorts and she asked why I was running *in boxers*. I tell her what F did, and then her smile disappears instantly, and told him that it was not OK what he did and it was a bad joke and he should have put himself in my place and blah blah blah. Finally MT asked me if anyone forced me to start running without pants and I told her ""No"". Then it goes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

MT: It was you who said yesterday that and intelligent person has self-control, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

MT: And where was your self-control? I consider you pretty intelligent.

&amp;#x200B;

Me (trying to make a stupid joke): In my pants

&amp;#x200B;

Then I realised how bad it sounded, and I tried explaining, while turning red and sweating: Because F took my pants and they weren't on me

&amp;#x200B;

MT, not amused: You do realise that it's pretty bad what's happening to you, right? You're in a free fall right now and that is not OK.

&amp;#x200B;

After 5 more minutes of a **REALLY** embarrassing conversation with MT (she just told me that I should be careful with what happens with me because I'm really smart but I'm just consuming my mind on stuff like this) I go to the blackboard and painfully sit in my desk.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if it's not obvious enough, I'm pretty smart, but also jerk sometimes.

TL;DR: My friend stole my shorts, and I chased him in boxers at school. My math teacher found out and asked me where is my self-control that comes with intelligence, and I tried making a joke and told her ""In my pants"", because my friend stole them from me. She did not laugh.

tifu,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.
First off, this didn't happen today but about a year back.  Sorry for format, currently on mobile.
I was alone in my house and my mom had just left. Me being a teen and being alone all day, I was constantly horny.  On the way to my bathroom to get toilet paper, I see the vacuum cleaner and an idea pops into my head. 
So here I am, plugging in the vacuum switching it on to see if it works and I put my dick in it. All seems good and nothing is going wrong except for the fact that I wasn't feeling much. I then decide to turn it to the max and thrust back and forth to get a variation of suction. Now feeling a bit more I do it for another minute or two and stop after I realise I can do a better job the old fashion way with my hand.  I quickly unplug the vacuum cleaner and look down, the base of my penis had a hickey on it.  There were spots of purple through the skin so I decide to not go on.  Fast forward a few hours later and most of my dick is purple and a distinct ring is visible at the base of my pubes. I spend the next few days regretting all my life decisions and trying to not feel embarrassed by my own stupidity.

I was having a shower when I thought that I don't need a face cleanser and I'll just stick with using shampoo on my face. It works on my hair it must work on my face,right? WRONG

I felt a bit of burn but decided that it's just my face's reaction to the shampoo so I didn't think much out of it

Well I went out of the shower and looked in the mirror only to see my face is fully red except for a few white spots. It's 6:30AM &amp; since we have a celebration going on rn.

Well, turns out I had my monitor plugged into my mobo the whole time. My RTX 2060 had been sitting there completely unused for the past month. The only reason I found out was because I was trying to get game clips through GeForce Experience, but it wasn't working.

Some background story for you, last night I was struck by a vehicle while riding on my motorcycle, can't really get into too much detail for legal reasons, but I had x-rays taken of my wrist and pelvis area. 

Long story short, this morning I called my parents over to look at the saved x-ray photos I had on my laptop to check out the injuries and while I thought I was scrolling through the multiple hand x-rays taken, I switched over to the pelvis photoshoot that was next in the array. And WHAM there it was staring the 3 off us right in the face, my Oscar Myer was perched up on my leg at an awkward angle from how I was laying in the bed.

I mean, It’s on, right?

So we’re going at it for a while and I realize things are starting to feel WAY better. I didn’t mind and we kept going, after a while I start to think something is wrong. So I pull me third leg away andddd, nothing there. We both search the bed and the surrounding area, nothing. She decides to go to the bathroom and check things out, I’m freaking out because it was round two and there was still residual baby residue on my skin flute. She comes in holding a tissue and I ask why she’s holding it. Apparently, the condom was NOT on all the way and got lost inside of her. She looked disgusted and freaked out that she might become pregnant. We decided that we’d buy the pill the next morning (since all drug stores were closed at the time). We both make jokes when we’re nervous so we ended up going to a dance group by our University and cracking a lot of bad jokes. The next morning she took the pill but I’m still nervous..

tifu,"Not really sure if this belongs on this subreddit and if it does another I'm probably banned from it.

You know I'm weird maybe a sociopath maybe I'm just a bad person in general.

To give you perspective of the stupid shit do I went on r/AskReddit and said "" People who have been raped did it feel good though "". That was today. Said some bad and disrespectful stuff some on par with the example others worse. 

r/AmITheAsshole r/Confession got a temp ban on raisedbynarcissists and I'm perm banned from askreddit. I've said some pretty dumb shit on nuclear revenge and haven't gotten banned which is just strange. All of those I've done stupid shit on.

Not to mention all the fake posts I've done. I mean I seriously I made up a fake story about me poking holes into my "" bullys "" condom and him impregnating a girl. I mean it's just stupid and pointless.

And at the end of the day I wonder if it's worth it. Getting the reactions of people being angry at whatever disrespectful thing I said at the moment. I mean I'm a text book Internet troll. Just a stupid little ass who sits and plays fortnite all day and when I'm not trolling on reddit.

I mean I've realised what I've done is wrong and all it does is make me look bad whenever I make genuine comments. A large percent of the time I receive replies that say something along the lines of "" well i mean this guy says the n-word all the time so he's probably lying "" and they have every right to believe that.

It's to a point where this is the only sub like that I somehow haven't been banned from. So if this isn't appropriate I understand and if this is taken down I understand.

So what made me decide to own up to my stupidity. Well it might not effect you but one of my friends uses social media and he feels like suicide is his best option. Mainly trashy homelife but I know he uses social media ( specifically reddit ) so if he uses reddit wouldn't I essentially help him kill himself. Chances are low but what if I'm the last straw.

And it's disgusting to think I'm doing for myself as well. We are both introverts so I feel like if he goes then any ounce of confidence inside me will vanish and i will be subject to bullying. I am a trashy human being. My friends contemplating suicide and i care about myself. I'm disgusting.

tifu,"As it’s often the case, this didn’t happen today, but a few years ago when I was maybe 15yo, young and naive.

My mom’s best friend back then was V, a young woman in her late-30s, the widow of a really great man that had died a few years earlier, too young, because of a disease.

V is a bright, intelligent, well-mannered and good-looking woman. After losing her husband and mourning his death for a long time, she started dating again. She brought to our home a few men over the years.

One of those times, V had invited over for dinner a man (let’s call him A) who she introduced to us as a “good friend”. A was a middle-aged man originally from Bosnia. He now lived in my hometown and run his construction business.

For those of you not fully aware of Bosnia and the things that happened there, brief history lesson. It’s a small country in the Balkans (Eastern Europe, north of Greece), and it used to be part of the former Yugoslavia. Long story short, in the 1990s a civil war broke out there, and things got really, really ugly, many were murdered, and many fled, including A.

That evening, at dinner we were all trying to get to know A better. He seemed a nice, soft-spoken man, mature, and with a lot of experience on his shoulders. We start asking him questions about how long he’s been out of Bosnia, etc.

I start to think of something witty to say to “vet” him. Something funny.

I asked him if he’d ever killed someone, jokingly.

He looked at me, all serious. He said yes. Everyone became silent.

He went on to explaining that during the war he had to make some difficult actions a couple of times. They were those situations where it was either his life (and the lives of his beloved ones), or the other person’s. He wasn’t a soldier, but just a regular civilian looking out for himself.

I felt horrible for asking this. When I thought I was just making a joke, I opened up some really painful memories. Things that were not easy for him. Still today, many years later, i can’t imagine how he must feel living with such memories. And it was also the first time young me started to realize what war actually is, how it impacts real people around us.

After a short moment in which everyone was trying to cope with strong emotions, the dinner slowly went back to normal. We never spoke about that again.

However, yesterday at lunch I somehow mixed up the mild and the extra hot sauce and took a big scoop full of the extra hot one. 

It took me by surprise and my body immediately reacted to the shock with extensive hiccups and hyperventilating (I know I’m a wussy). 

In all this chaos, some of the sauce went up my nasal cavity. And that’s when the torture really began.

tifu,"This happened a couple months ago, and I completely forgot about it until some groupchat was made this morning about how I'm a pervert and other things. I'll start from the beginning.

A month or so ago, my friend was at my house, and we were playing truth or dare. I chose dare, and he dared me to message Emily (we're just going to call her that for this story) and ask her for nudes. Now, Emily is not very attractive at all, no offense. She has a terrible personality, and not many people like her. But me, being the idiot I am, didnt think anything of it, and I messaged her, and my friend and I were just saying a bunch of random things and asking her for nudes, jokingly.

Let me remind you that I'm an idiot. 

She actually ended up sending nudes and I was like yo wtf, but my friend thought she was hot. He already knew the password to my Instagram account (where I was messaging Emily), and he then ended up messaging her many more times without my consent and without me knowing. She sent nudes to him a couple of times, and he finally fessed up to me recently. However,  Emily's friend, Janice, messaged me and told me to stop harassing Emily. I told her partly what happened, but she didn't believe me at all. I finally got my other friend, not the one I mentioned previously, to message Janice and convince her that I wouldn't do something like that. She believed him, and I, with a sigh of relief, went on my way. Until today. This morning, I woke up, checked my phone, and saw that I was in a groupchat on Instagram with most of my grade in it. I thought, ""Wtf,"" and read through it. Emily was sending screenshots of me and some other guy who ""harassed her"" and asked for nudes. She left out the part that she did in fact send nudes, and now I might be in deep shit, as the whole school thinksI'm a pervert. Also, if this ends up getting out to a higher figure/authority, this could end up getting me expelled or worse.

tifu,"Disclaimer: I'm not proud of the spineless little shit you're about to read about, but it's too good of a story to not share

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm 17 years old. Small town. Friends with the football team (don't play myself; however that detail will come into play later on). It's a meme/common knowledge that there's nothing to do for kids in small towns. That's us. We're bored, looking for something to do. In my area, we had this game called 'Spoons' we had heard about, where you drive through your city's 'Red Light District' and throw spoons at the hookers walking the street. Every spoon you miss, you have to stop the car and go retrieve the spoon. Well we were too chickenshit for that so we decided to just drive up and down 81 St throwing eggs at hookers. It must have been a slow night because there was only one girl walking the street that night, and we hit her a couple times. After the 2nd pass, we turned around and saw her walking into an alley with some dude. Didn't think anything of it, assumed he had just picked her up and we continued our 'hunt'.

We're sitting at the intersection of 81 St and Major Highway. I feel a bump on my car, turn around in my seat and see this big, lifted Dodge V8 on my bumper. The hooker is climbing out of the passenger seat, and as she's doing so she's whipping out a switchblade and screaming 'YOU WANNA FUCK AROUND??' It takes me a second to process just what's happening, meanwhile my friends are screaming 'OP FUCKING DRIVE'. I punch it and blow the light, and start heading down the highway. Now keep in mind; we're in a bright, cherry red Toyota Echo. The thing was gutless. And we had it crammed full of probably close to 1000 lbs between me and my linebacker friends. I could barely get up to 80kph. Meanwhile, the hooker has climbed back into the truck and her and her pimp are now chasing us down the highway, trying to run us off the road. They weren't hitting my car mind you, but driving parallel and inching closer and closer until I would slam on my brakes because I'm about to hit the barricade, they would pull in front of us and try to stop us but I would just swing around them and keep trying to putz away (this was at like 10:30 on a weeknight so the highway was dead). We played this game for a couple kilometres. The entire time I'm slouched way down in my seat, just barely peeking over the steering wheel, and my friends are all huddled down in the car too; we thought they had been shooting at us but we realized later on they had just been throwing shit at my car. (You can laugh all you want but our adrenaline was through the fucking roof, and when you're being chased by a pimp and you're hearing thwmp thwmp thwmp hitting your car, what else would be going through your mind?)

At some point, one of my friends had decided to call the police. Being the spoiled, entitled children we were, we claimed this guy just started chasing us and we didn't know why, we're scared for our lives, he's trying to run us off the road, we think he's shooting at us etc etc. The dispatch lady says she wants to put us on the line with an officer on patrol and puts us on hold. We're on hold for what feels like an eternity (probably 3-5 minutes in reality, but that was a long fucking 3-5 minutes), and finally get on the line with an officer. And what's his advice? ***He wants us to pull into the nearest gas station and wait for him there.*** Remember, we're still being chased, still playing this game on the highway, and we're all hunched down as low as we can possibly get because we think we're being shot at. My friend calls the officer a useless twat and hangs up on him.

At this point we realize we're going to have to deal with this ourselves, so I have the bright idea of getting off the highway and trying to lose them in a subdivision. It had worked for me a year prior when I successfully ran from the police (I was a fucking deadbeat from 16-25; and believe me, I see the irony in running from the police and then a year later calling on them; especially because it was a situation of my own making). But I didn't take into account the fact that my gutless Echo was weighed down by 1000 lbs of high school football team, and buddy just stayed right on our ass the whole time. We get back on the highway and just start driving. They follow us for another 20km or so (they've stopped trying to run us off the road and are just following us now), and we finally see them take an exit and turn back around to the city. Shaking, we collectively breathe a huge sigh of relief and turn around back to our small town. I didn't step foot in the city again for a loooong time after that. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes kids.

Looking back, it's pretty clear now that once they realized we were kids, they were just trying to fuck with us and scare us, but it was still one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. Completely and 100% deserved, but still terrifying.

tifu,"So this fuck up actually happened about a month ago but I thought I’d share.  TL;DR at end.

So I was going to the bathroom at my school during class to, ya know, take a massive shit, like ya do.  I plop a squat, whip out my phone and start browsing Reddit (love you guys), not thinking anything of it.  Now, because this is during class, the bathroom wasn’t too crowded, and I took my sweet time.  So, I washed my hands, put my phone away, and as I was walking out of the stall, I noticed something....the stall door was swinging, ever so slightly.  And it wasn’t locked.

Okay, no bid deal, the bathroom is empty anyways, nobody saw me.  Nope! I walk out, we one dude standing next to my stall, there’s a dude in the stall next over, and someone just walked in.  The first guy turns to me, looking absolutely scarred, and just says “You gotta kick the door man....” and proceeds to go into the stall I just left.  Now I’m just left sitting there, contemplating the fact that this dude just saw me browsing reddit, junk out, taking a shit, and he is now scarred for life.  Worst of all, one of the other people in there was someone I knew and had a bunch of classes with.  I tried to brush it off by laughing and saying “Wow, I thought it was locked!”  Nope.  Didn’t help the awkwardness.  I have never left a bathroom faster.

So, the moral of the story?  Always double check the lock on a public stall.  Hope y’all enjoyed my pain and embarrassment.

tifu,"This actually did occur today just a few shameful hours ago. I had a dentist appointment this morning to get a cleaning from the hygienist as it’s about that time of the year to be reminded of my poor flossing habits. I haven’t been in about 6 months and to my surprise when I get called back, the hygienist who calls my name is a pretty cute Asian girl I went to high school with a few years back. She recognizes me as bigggggchungusguy and we make some small talk on the way to the dental chair. 

Everything is going fine and I’m actually thinking about asking for her number after this is over while she’s busy digging around my mouth with those medieval looking plaque pick things.Now everyone has laid in the dental chair while the hygienist or dentist who’s cramming their fingers in your mouth tries to make small talk so it’s not awkward as they’re fisting your gaping mouth. Most of the time you can’t respond much more than an “uhuh” or “mhmm” since, again, fist in your mouth. 

Here’s where my fuck up happens; as is physiology, my mouth is filling with saliva because it’s opened wide while she’s cleaning my teeth. I’m trying not to swallow so she can evaluate my gingivitis, and I am patiently waiting for her to get to the part where she decides the pool of saliva building in the back of my throat is substantial enough to get the little suction hose to let you clear it out. Before we reached that point, she decided to tell a joke while my mouth was wide open staring up at her right in the face. 

I start to laugh and immediately feel the pool of saliva in my throat catapult out of my mouth and go at least 3 feet in the air. She jumped backward covered in a substantial amount of my goo, dumbfounded, when I pop up and say “I swear thats never happened before.”  Fuck. She muttered an “I’ll be right back” and went to clean my sputum off of herself. I heard her murmuring about it to one of the other workers in the office and them laughing pretty loudly about it on my way out. Obviously, I did not ask for her number and may have to find a new dentist.

tifu,"This happened two days ago.

I'm a rising sophomore in college right now. I go to school hundreds of miles away from my ex-girlfriend, we haven't spoken in months.

In high school, we had a terrible relationship. She would flirt with other boys in front of me, she would shun me for weeks with no prior warning or indication as to what happened, and she was exceptionally unkind. As a 16 year-old male, however, none of this mattered as long as the prospect of sexual relations was on the horizon.

Occasionally, her family would make a trip up from Philly to New York, where she would visit a ""close friend"" named John. I always had my doubts, as did my her friends, including her best-friend who I am quite close with, but I am now fairly confident that 'John' was a little more than a friend. In fact, on more than one occasion she mentioned to acquaintances that she had more plans than just to hang out and watch movies.

On seperate occasions, especially when flirting with other boys, her relationship with John was either much less or much more than what she had described to her friends and I. Needless to say, whether he was real or not, John's ""existence"" pissed me off, and was one of the reasons I broke up with her.

A couple days ago, during a night out with my friends, I received the first text I had from her in months: ""Hey!"". I figured she was either intoxicated or ""in the mood"", which was usually when she texted me. I was happy to hear from her and was excited to keep talking. I coddled her with questions about how her first year went and received one-word responses—this is how our conversations usually went. She briefly mentioned she was in New York for the weekend, so I jokingly responded with ""Ah, a rump in the sack with the 'ol John, eh?"", a friendly tease, to which she curtly replied ""I  haven't been with him in months"".

I replied with a frowny-face emoji and didn't hear back for a few hours. I was getting a little anxious a this point. My social life in the time I had spent without her was stress-free for the most part, and this interaction reminded me of all the crap she put me through. I had always felt our conversations were ironically fraught with layers of masking for the sake of appearance and it was pissing me off that I was falling into the same routine once again.

In a momentary lapse of consideration, I angrily, but still lightheartedly asked ""Did he get hit my a truck?"", in the hopes that in the worst possible outcome she would tell me off for being rude and it may just break some of the tension between us. It was impulsive and impolite, I know, but part of me had just given up at this point.

'Please don't talk to me"" was the response I got. Not great, but I could live with it. Then, twenty minutes later, she said this:

""My boyfriend was killed in a car crash in January. I don't find it funny.""

My stomach crawled into my throat as I reread the text until it sank in. I am not a particularly impulsive person, and the one time I decided to take a ""risk"", if you will, not only did it backfire, but it exploded in my face and swept me off my feet. 

She called me that night and assured me that everything was okay, as there was simply know way for me to have known. I still feel like shit, to say the least.

OMG! What am I doing? Why am I showing this to him? Why am I explaining it to him? Why don't I stop?

Then I stopped explaining and started showing some cursed comments just to ease the tension.

I still stumble across his collection on his phone sometimes and they are mostly low quality stuff and he streams from xvideos when he can. He knew I used to watch it on his phone when I was younger. But taboo. 
So back to last night and I dozed off while the video was playing. The story was too boring. It rained last night so dad must have come in to close the windows. I wake up in the morning to find one among many texts that my 90% of my 2gb daily data has been exhausted, all tabs closed meticulously and the phone kept on the side table rather than my bed where it should have been. I open my phone and check my history (yep, porn) and the data details to see that almost all the data was used up in a period of 2 hours. So I didn't meet my dad the morning - I stayed in the bathroom till he went off to work. And we know of it, but still no mention. Hopefully never. I don't mind it, he pays for my data so...

tifu,"So this all literally just happened yesterday. I work at a clothing retail store that's in the same league as polo, American Eagle, and H&amp;M. I am the stock expert, so my job is basically just to receive shipment, censor it and flow it to the floor. 

I am taking summer classes, and have a paper that is due Friday that I would be working on this week. I figured I would get some Adderall and just knock it out on my day off today. So I text my dude to meet me when I take my lunch, so it would save me time going to him. 

I'm not sure if you have ever seen or worked at a retail store, but most of all the employees wear walkie talkies so they can communicate without having to scream across the store or have to talk about someone stealing, etc.. So I keep mine clipped to the back of my belt so it's not ever in my way at work then just have my earpiece that's connected to my walkie on the back of my belt. 

So I go on my lunch break, and my dude tells me he's in the parking lot. I clock out and go to meet him in his car. I go to sit in the front seat and start to go about the deal. What I didn't realize was that I was leaning on my walkie the whole time... The conversation between my dealer and me went a little like 

Me: ""You think I can get 6 of these for $30?"" 
Dealer: ""Nah man, I need $7 a piece for these Adderall, but I got some blow if you want?"" 
Me: ""I'm cool with the Adderall, you still get the wax pens?"" 
Dealer: ""yea man just get at me""

So I leave with my Adderall and go to walk back into the store. As soon as I walked in I knew something was wrong instantly. Everyone was staring at me like I've just been accused of a triple murder. I brush it off, and go walk into the back to continue to work. About five minutes later the assistant manager comes back and ask to see me in the office. I follow her to the office and she closes the door behind me. Not a good sign. She ask me where I went on my lunch break. I told her to grab food. She said ""are you sure you didn't grab anything else?"" I asked her what she meant by that and she told me everything. How everyone heard the whole conversation between my drug dealer and I. That I must of been sitting on my walkie talkie. I tried to act as composed as I could, but I was shitting bricks.  

She tells that this situation has never happened to her and she doesn't even know where to move forward with this. She told me to just go home for the day because she was worried about me working ""under the influence"". She told me our District manager will be in on Friday and it will be brought up to her then. 

I am upset with myself for how it happened, but thankfully it's not my primary job. I work there for the discounts on clothes for my girlfriend and I, and for some extra cash. I still am pretty pissed at myself that this happened, and this is something I feel like would only happen to me. So regardless of what happens Friday, there going to be adding a new section in the HR rule book because of me most likely.

tifu,"Obligatory disclaimer this happened two weeks ago but my friend convinced me it's worthy to be here.

I work in a kitchen and one of my duties is to of course wash dishes. One day after prepping my boss tells me to bleach the cutting boards. I work in a sushi bar so the boards get quite oily and gross after a while so we try to bleach them once a month. Our wash station is a three compartment sink and I am bleaching a couple of normal industry boards and one sushi top board. A normal board is maybe 4ft by 3ft not that big. A sushi board is 5ft by 15ft maybe. Point being it's big and won't sit in the sink compartment. 

In one of the compartment sinks I have the regular boards and over top I have sushi board. I rinse off the board and proceed to scrub it down with our soap to get off any bleach residue. I start to notice I'm sweating a lot more and everytime I inhale it burn my lungs. I think nothing of it cause it's just bleach. I'm still scrubbing when my chest really starts burning and I get light headed. As I start to back away my nose starts furiously bleeding and I feel like I'm about to pass out. I step out of the kitchen and out into the dining room and take a seat where I proceed to pass out on one of the tables still bleeding. 

I wake up 10 minutes later thinking holy fuck what have I done. Covered in my blood from my nose I go back to the sink and read what's in our dish soap. Citrus and ammonia. Ammonia. The very thing which you do not mix with bleach because it results in mustard gas. Yay for me.

I go outside catch some air. Go back in turn on the vents full blast to try take out the chemical bomb I decided to make in the restaurant. Went home got some rest and went to work suffering feeling like I was being stabbed in the chest. Went to the doctor the next day said should be fine just need to air out my lungs but long term problems could arise if exposure was very bad. Hard to tell until symptoms appear. 

I don't like working and I don't touch the bleach anymore.

TLDR: Was doing my job cleaning like my boss had asked. Couldn't take it anymore. Decided to subconsciously make mustard gas to end my suffering.",Tifu by cleaning and trying to recreate chemical warfare

This happened a couple days ago.

First, I am a female. Second, I will occasionally do odd things after falling asleep if I have taken a pain killer-its rare but it does happen and it has never been this extreme. Third, when I was a child I was scalded pretty badly so I have very little hair including pubic hair, so I have never shaved the bikini zone.

I took a painkiller and went to bed-I remember nothing else until around noon the next day. I do know I got up at the normal time, got the kid off to school, left the house and ran errands, then came home to settle in and work (I am a writer). However, I only know this happened because I have proof that it was all done, I remember none of it. I also don't remember getting up in the middle of the night (I woke my husband) and taking a bath.

So, after a quick lunch I went to the bathroom and...I was completely bare 'down there'. I checked the shower and my razor was filled with little curlies. I called my husband at work and he assured me he had no clue about it except I did wake him when I got up to take the bath.

This may not be the worst TIFU, but it might be the itchiest and most hilarious.

tifu,"My best friend Heidi had to be induced early on Saturday, and spent the weekend laboring, and I stayed with her in her hospital room. Early yesterday morning, the doctor attempted to break her water, but not much fluid was present, so the doctor left it. 


Heidi labored all day yesterday, and though her original plan was to only have her husband in the room as she pushed, when it came time, she asked me to stay to help her and take pictures. 


When she was ready to start really pushing, I swapped out with a nurse, and held Heidi’s left leg for her. I took over counting to ten during each push, and finally, after almost three hours, the baby made her appearance. 


The important thing to note here is that the amniotic sack had not, in fact, been fully ruptured. When baby girl exited, the amniotic sack exploded out at the same time, and its trajectory carried it right into my face...and open mouth.

tifu,"My seven year old daughter has become a bit of a Pokemon enthusiast lately, so I found myself feeling sentimental for the old games. Pokemon Quest was cool, but it just wasn't scratching my itch.

 When Gold, Silver, and Gameboy color had been newly released my great grandmother died. She had raised me up to that point and I had just shut down after her sudden passing. Her daughter, my grandma, bought me a purple gameboy color and Pokemon Silver for my birthday that year. I played the hell out of that game and Zelda Oracle of seasons. It was my only outlet in a world where my whole life had changed for the worst overnight.

I had a sister who had gold and we used to trade Pokemon on the weekends at my dad's house. She also bought Zelda Oracle of Ages and we'd swap the two back and forth. 

So, feeling mega sentimental for a childhood happy place I downloaded an emulator my husband found for Pokemon Crystal, the one I never got to play. I snuck my teeth into it. My daughter and I played together, I'd let her play but give her advice while I conditioned and detangled her hair, that kind of thing. I played when the kids were asleep and put a little more time into it than I should have. I even got my husband into it. 

Well, this morning I was adjusting some settings in the emulator and I hit the wrong option without realizing it. I was given a prompt that asked ""Are you sure?"". Not paying attention like the cocky dumbo that I am I thought *What are you giving me shit about? Do what I said, I know what I tapped.*

But I was wrong. I was so wrong. All of our progress is gone. I figured out what I did wrong, but it's not fixable. I shouldn't be upset, but I'm a little crushed. My daughter doesn't care as we have other games and interests that we share, so she doesn't mind starting over.

But I had just beaten the Indigo Plateau/Elite Four. I had newly caught Raikou, and had just evolved my Eevee into a tank of an Umbreon last night. All gone. *Poof*

Well, this happened yesterday at a Chili’s that I went to with my friends to celebrate our graduation. We were being served our food when I notice a waitress with a nice ass. I text my friend to look to his right and he just laughs and shakes his head. He is usually talking about stuff like clapping cheeks and what not so I just said it and didn’t think much of it. We come back to school today (one of the last days at school) and he asks if anyone wants to hear something I said yesterday. My other friends say yes and he looks to me to see if he is allowed to say it. He says what I said and my friends just laugh a little and joke about it. But I have this one friend, (she’s my ex and we have been talking for a couple weeks now and she’s admitted to liking me and I like her too but she just doesn’t know if she wants to date) let’s call her A. So A was laughing along with this too, but by second period, her mood seemed to change. She looked sad and was laying her head on the table and had this distant look in her eyes. I asked her what was wrong in class but she just shrugged. I texted her later and she said it was because of what I did. She was jealous and hurt. I felt really bad, but I didn’t know it would turn out this way. She said she was so happy with how things were going but me saying that made her sad. She said that I always talked about how I liked her and how much I meant to her, but that clearly didn’t mean anything since I said something like that. She wants to be normal friends again and she told me that she doesn’t trust me as much as she used to. No flirting, no sending each other pictures, no feelings attached. Just normal friends.

tifu,"It's been quite an interesting week.
After living together with my 2 best friends in a small town, we all moved out to different parts of the country.
I for one, decided to move to a big city where I hardly know anybody. I have visited the city before, and always loved my time there. 
However, I didn't expect the crippling loneliness of living by myself for the first time would hit so hard, especially compared to the years I spent living with friends.

So I started wandering around the city by myself just to get some daylight and groceries. On my way there, I passed a... weed store...? Coffeeshop...? What do people call those anyways?

Me having never even tried drugs before, due to losing a family member to drugs and friends get into deep with all kinds of substances I wouldn't even know how to use. 
I decided to walk in, buy $20 worth of weed to help me forget about my lonely state of mind and fall asleep when it gets dark.

Right after dinner I get a call from one of my friends who was having a rough day and feeling equally lonely. So I suggested I could take a train to her place, we could get some food, watch tv, and fall asleep together. 
Oh, and I told her I just bought weed for the first time ever, and we could smoke it together if she wanted to.

So I started walking towards the trainstation, when suddenly a huge thunder storm came out of nowhere. It started raining so hard that I could barely hear my own thoughts and had to take shelter at a bus stop halfway between my new place and the trainstation and ended up missing the train because of the pouring rain.

I felt pretty bad for missing my last train, not being able to be there for my friend and having to spend the night alone in my room again. 

After the rain had stopped, I headed back to my place and saw a homeless guy, soaking wet, draging his blanket and matress through the puddles of rain. Me being from a small town, and not being used to seeing homeless people. The overal look of pure misery made me feel awful to my core, and I wanted to help him out.

I offered him my dry jacket so he wouldn't freeze to death tonight. He did not say a single word. No ""thank you"" or smile.
I figured his day must have been so awful that he couldn't even force himself to smile just a little bit.

As I got home, I started emptying out my pockets to attempt to roll my very first joint ever. And OFCOURSE, my $20 worth of weed was still in that jacket I gave to the homeless guy. 
And just like my jacket, he probably needed it more than I do.

So to this day I still haven't smoked weed once in my lifetime, but got a pretty unique story out of my first experience with weed.

TL;DR: I bought weed for the first time in my life, gave away my jacket to a homeless guy with all the weed still inside of it.",TIFU by giving my jacket to a homeless guy.

The kids just had their baths and the 7 year old needed help applying on some lotion and calls me into the bedroom to help. So here I go in, take what I think is a good amount of lotion and slather it all over her back and arms. Not surprisingly, while massaging it into her skin I realise something is wrong, like the texture and consistency wasn't like cream or lotion. I pick up the bottle and turn it over only to realise that I had just covered the kid in handwash. Died laughing at my own stupidity and had to send her back into the bath to get the soap off.

In my defense, who the hell keeps handwash on their bedside table and well, the back of the bottle with the product details was facing me so I didn't actually read the label on the front.

Being the spoiled first generation American I am, I brushed all of those warnings off and told myself nothing like this would happen to me. 

I was hanging out with some friends at some cafe and the minute I left I came to realization that I didn't have my phone on me. I Ofcourse went back to look for it but it was nowhere to be found. I had a mini heart attack and was pretty butthurt about it. I finally accepted my fate and started thinking about the steps I would take next. The first thing that came to my mind was to keep calling my phone until someone eventually picks up. That's exactly what I did. 2 hours later someone finally decided to pick up. They honestly sounded pretty nice and well rounded and I couldn't expect the worst out of them. He told me that he found my phone on the table at the cafe that I was at (I must have forgotten it there when I left) and that he couldn't trust anyone to give them the phone so he just decided to keep it with him until someone would eventually call. I truly believed him and wasnt suspicious about anything. I gave him my number and we decided we would meet that night so I could get my phone back. I ensured contact between us and thanked him for doing this. I even hinted at me giving him a ""little reward"" for doing all of this. As I was getting ready to head out I got a call from the dude saying he couldn't make it out tonight. I sounded pretty bummed out and he noticed it really quickly. Then he suggested the idea of sending someone else over with the phone but first he had to verify that the phone is actually mine. He asked me for the password and me being the little dumbass I am gave it to him since I had no choice. Suprise surprise no one showed up to give me my phone back and here I am cursing myself after going through the vicious cycle of changing all of my passwords on every imaginable service.

tifu,"first post and on mobile, sorry for any mistakes since i’m new to reddit and have no idea what i’m doing.

So, I’m a high school student just finishing finals, getting everyone to sign my yearbook. Some kids put some edgy stuff, like haha, that’s a little obscene, but not too bad. Normal high schooler stuff. Later, a few boys in one of my classes wrote some pretty nasty stuff, like racism and a drawing or two that were pretty bad. Of course I didn’t care, it was all a joke and I actually said they could put whatever. 

The next day, I hand one of my teachers my yearbook to sign on a different page, since I didn’t really want him to see that. I come back and he tells me that he flipped through them, and wanted to know who drew some of the drawings, as they were pretty bad, but not signed. I told him that they drew those when I wasn’t looking, and he said I could sharpie over them when I came back from the bathroom. So, I go and do my business, and come back to find my yearbook was gone.

Turns out, the teacher read some of the obscene stuff and turned it to the school administration office while I was in the bathroom. So, I ended up making my way to the office to meet with the guidance counselor about this, and he could only figure out one name that was written clearly, a boy that I like a lot, and would never want to get into trouble, and calls him up to the office. 

So now I’m a mess and feel awful, and after he met with the counselor, he told me that it was an offense that could get him expelled. And that he also figured out two more of the names in the book.

I apologized to this boy in tears because of just how awful i felt/feel, and knowing that two more boys might get expelled for this just makes me feel terrible. I ended up spending about 2 hours in the office just trying to keep the boy from getting expelled.

Might update when I learn what will happen to the three.

TLDR: Teacher turned in a yearbook with some bad stuff in it that can be linked to some of my friends, might get them expelled.

tifu,"Dear all, finally my time to shine!

This TIFU happened yesterday, but it's beginnings were stretched all the way back to March, more specifically my birthday. As I met my father and his wife for a dinner, as it is appropriate for such occasion, they've presented me with a gift. It was a nice envelope with two printed &amp; folded tickets for a Sting concert. More than that, the tickets were marked as ""Golden circle"", so they weren't exactly the cheapest, as it was visible from the top piece of paper. Not even taking the tickets out, I've closed the envelope and saved it somewhere where i'll remember in 3 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

Through this year I've bonded a really good friendship with one of my ex co-workers, she's one of the best, most genuine persons I've ever met. Every moment we spent together, we had a really great time, always something to talk about, getting drunk together, listening to the music etc. you get the idea. I'd probably even ask her out on a date if she wouldn't be in a serious and really good relationship. One day as we were talking about concerts, she mentioned that she'd like to attend a upcoming Sting concert, and naturally I said she can go with me as I have one extra ticket. At first she didn't want to accept it, stating that she would feel bad going there for free, but after I explained to her that I'd love to give ticket to someone who would actually enjoy music and that I value her company more than one concert ticket, she accepted it. And she was so happy! 

&amp;#x200B;

Here comes yesterday and with every hour, excitement for the gig is rising. We've decided to meet in a nearby bar to have a few beers  to be prepared for 2 hours of music treatment we've been waiting for. I've arrived a little earlier, ordered myself first glass of beer and decided to check timings on tickets. I opened the envelope...

&amp;#x200B;

There was only one ticket inside. It was so weirdly folded that it looked like there were two pieces of paper inside. The whole bar turned their heads on to me as I really, really loudly say FUCK. Few moments later she arrived, happily smiling, knowing she'll see Sting today. My brains collapsed. In a little panic I excused myself and went to the toilet and had one of those weird self loathing/motivational/mad talks with myself, how stupid I am and what to do. Should I tell her? Should I say I fucked up and after all she can't attend the concert? Should I just give her my ticket? Should I ask her to split the cost of another ticket for the front row? I nervously took my phone and check if there are even any tickets available. Luckily there were. I said fuck it, took my credit card and bought another ticket. I went back, had a beer, went to a gig, had an amazing time, and never mentioned her a single thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the thing is, money doesn't mean anything to me. It doesn't represent any virtues in my life. I don't care if I spend it for my friends, as I value them in my life more. In first glance, I could even sell the ""other"" ticket for some good cash. Memory of yesterday is worth more than any amount of € is what I'm trying to say. 

BUT.

 This year I've decided to start a project  about music scene in our country. This would include hosting an interview type of podcast with musicians, and create a shared space and network of musicians, and every youngster that wants to become one. That's why I've been putting money aside each month in order to buy all necessary equipment, and being a student with part time job, it's not that easy. If everything would go according to plan, I would have saved just enough money to buy everything I need tomorrow as I would received my monthly pay check, while still have some bucks aside to get through month comfortably. Obviously it didn't and I'm almost back on the start. But the gig was great, and it's been a really happy day.

So I've had an excruciatingly sore leg, thigh basically, the entire thing, for about a week. Yesterday it got the point I couldn't walk without a limp, luckily my job isn't walking intensive so that's all good.

Just before bed I decided enough is enough, and grabbed the tiger balm. For those who don't know, tiger balm is incredibly good at easing muscle aches and pains, for a price. It heats up very quickly, if you're not ready for it, it can be quite a shock how hot it feels.

Anyway, seeing as how I'm married and I massage my wife's shoulder with this stuff every few days, I asked if she could help me out with this, but I looked her dead in the eyes and whispered ""please avoid my balls"". We both laughed and I walked off for a shower.

About 30 minutes later, my wonderful wife jumped in the shower as I was climbing into bed, the pain was so bad, even having the sheet on it hurt. I thought oh my God I'm not waiting, and grabbed the tiger balm.

Amazing relief as I covered my thigh and quad in this gift from the gods. The heat brought relief and a break in the pain. 

At this point I realised I needed to charge my phone for work, I rolled over to plug it in, did so and rolled back over. It was at that moment I knew I had fucked up.

My balls gently unpeeled from my recently balmed thigh, and immediately started heating up. Now it hurt, but it wasn't bad enough to get my dumbass out of bed and back in the shower.

So a little background, I am on the ultimate Frisbee team, and I like to drink.

So, there is a party for a few of the club sports, I go there with the Frisbee team, and the party isn't that great. I drank a lot of whiskey, carrying the bottle with me. Not to much left in the bottle when someone on the team tells me to finish it. I get down on one knee and chug that shit, cause I ain't no bitch. As soon as I stand up, I whip the bottle across the room at the giant mirror above the bar area. Whole thing shatters and falls down. I walk away immediately, then a bunch of the soccer team (who's house it was) go up to me and demand $50. I was a drunk asshole, so I gave them the $7 from my wallet, and got the fuck out of there. They didn't let me into the next party.

I should note afterword I followed up with them, and did pay them the $100 it cost to replace the mirror, because I am not an asshole when sober.

tifu,"On the yesterday I have did the most worst and dumb thing I ever did do, and I am brimmed to the top with shame, terror, embarassed feelings, and astonishment, due to what I did. So, I will tell you. 

You see, I will confess that I have not yet did sex. (ever! omg). So, but I do has a girlfriend, and she was starting to say that we SHOULD do sex. At first I thought, okay, that would be good. But then, I thought, well wait. I am nervous! 

Sometime I am very nervous and shaky, about many type of things, events, and what such. Well, even greater more than those other times I hint to in my sentence, when finally it was about to do sex, I became full of more nervousness than ever in my entire life. Very bad. 

Sometime when I become full of nervous opinions my thoughts do become incorrect. So, I was so nervous about this, I says to my girlfriend I can not actually do sex. And I seen she became confused by it. She asks me, why does I not want to do sex? So like I said, I became full of panic and incorrect thoughts, but I did think I has to think of an excuse right fast on account of I am so nervous and too nervous to do sex. What can I think to say? 

So I said to her my penis fell off on the other day, and so this is why I can not do sex. It was the bad excuse I do see but that is what I did say. Oh my god. She said what. I said again yes my penis fell off. She asked what am I talking about, and so what I did is I say that my penis just fell off by cause of a mistake, and so, I has to later go to an appointment to fix it. So as because of that, I can not do any sex or whatever like that until my appointment, and they attack it back onto me. (my penis) 

So yes I know it is the idea full of all inplausables, but I knowed I had to keep saying it or elst she will say I am a liar. And I was a liar but I meant it to be not bad but to just have a reason to not do sex yet. So I kept saying about how my penis really did fall off even though she did not believe, and so because of her not believing on my statements I felt, due to becoming full of panic, that I had to keep saying the false lie but with more detail about it and all. Oh god. 

So, she became very angry at me. And what I should have do is say, I am sorry I am nervous my penis did not fall off. But instead I kept saying it DID fall off, and when I have my appontment and it gets put back on me then we can do sex. So she say when? When is my appointment? And I said in August. And she said how can I go to the restroom (toilet) if I does not have a penis, and I said well it is very troubling for me. And she said she ""has enough of this nonsense"" and became very angry and left. 

Oh brother. Why did I say my penis fell off? I am not the smart person. Oh god. But now I am still saying the lie in our phone messages (with texting) and trying to say it is true. I know it bad to tell the lie, to be false, but I think the lie is not doing the harm. I think if I can just cause the delay before doing sex so I can lessen my nervous opinions it will work out. I must convince her my penis did fall off. But is that immoral. Oh my god. Can I be truthful? Oh my god. 

I wanted to share about my bad tifu and see what reddit will say and if has advice. Because for know it seems that my girlfriend will break up with me and if so I will be so sad, on account of I have much love in my heart for her. Also I am fearful she will tell my good friends and nice family about this horrible lie, and so everyone will have hate for me. I am full of sad feelings. Oh god. Why has I done it.

tifu,"Well, this happened about a couple of hours ago, so definitely today! My hands are still burning...

I've been a volunteer medic for just under a year now, and pertinent information, I'm allergic to latex, not majorly but still enough to be irritating. What I did not realise until today, is that our good friend rescusi-annie is covered in latex. I have performed CPR on dolls several times, and honestly not thought that maybe my hands itched because of the material. They generally make the user feel a little grotty, so I assumed its just that. I have also performed mouth-to-mouth on one, and not associated tingly lips with it either so maybe i'm just really thick.

However today, I was lucky enough to discover that repeated exposure has made my allergy worse. Thankfully only with my hands, there isn't much tissue on the palm of the hands able to swell, but what is able to, is now a reddened, itchy mass. However, in the interest of ensuring others don't repeat my mistakes, I'm endeavouring to pass the lesson on.

We were running a scenario, with a patient with no pulse and no breathing. Pretty standard, and luckily my unit now has an ambubag, and someone qualified to use it, so no more mouth-to-mouth for me! But whilst the defib is set up, chest compressions still have to be done.

Starting one rep, hands itch slightly, I'm in the zone, its not a problem. Break as patient is bagged, relief, if only for 10 seconds.

Second rep, hands starting to burn, funny, I don't remember tiring this quickly before. Power on through, patient depending on me. Bagged, little bit more relief. Pads for the defib on, and ready.

Third rep. Itchy, burning, surely its just exertion. Don't want to swap out yet, should be capable for a couple of minutes. 'Where's that defib?' I ask, praying its seconds away, and I can remove my hands! ""Its not working, the battery's gone"". Thank god its not a real patient, i think.

fourth rep, burning like the fires of hell. Thirty compressions, and relax. Something, though I can't think what is wrong, isn't right, can't take it any more. 'Swap!' I ask, getting a roasting for not giving a full reps notice, but I no longer care. Ah the cool plastic of the ambubag. My hands are on fire, they are cramping. I mess up my first squeeze.

Defib works, everything dandy, Annie saved for another day. Thank the lord. Hands itch, slightly red and puffy. Brain not working can't think why this is!

Half an hour later, and I get home. My hands itch like hell, I've washed them raw. Mum asks whats wrong, and I tell her about the hellfire, and about what I'd done that day. ""You know Annie's are made of latex don't you!"" She says.

No. Somehow, despite my known allergy to latex, I have never associated the feeling of that reaction with the Annie-itch I get every time I use one. Suddenly much is explained all at once. Believe it or not I have never once associated my symptoms with my allergy, despite being trained to identify allergic reactions.

Next time, I'll use nitrile gloves. The itch and burn *will* wear off, but in the meantime I'm in hell!

tifu,"Okay so this is my first time doing a TIFU so I apologize for writing it not like the rules.

We all know that everyone loves to mess PCs, specially if it's in school or an other place. So I kinda have a small knowledge about computers, so I decided to trigger a BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death) and laugh at it. 

I really do hate that IT department from school, since they do shit for the stuff we have. Sometimes it's slow or it misses the graphics drivers - which is what I expect to happen on laptops.

So I created my own fakebsod.bat with a special code in it that actually halts the system and makes it crash. Now the problem was, I miss the admin privileges, which nobody as a student owns on a school PC. So Windows detected my batch file as a virus and immediately reported it to my teachers. The company wrote an Email too ALL my teachers saying that I should delete it.

Now due to their incompetent service, it was already deleted since it resets automatically (the system). Later on my teacher called me and asked me about it. We both looked at it and there was nothing. I'm so scared at the moment! Don't know what to use as an excuse either, since I said to the teacher that I have no idea.


TL;DR Made a batch file, got detected as virus - got reported to teachers and they called me and looked at the file with me that was already deleted. I don't know the consequences, but I'll not get free easily.",TIFU by executing a batch.dat in school.
tifu,"Throwaway account for obv reasons.
Brought up with an incredibly abusive mother, I've been with an abusive girlfriend for 5 years. We went non monogamous 2 years ago and her sis (who was living in our flat bc of financial issues and her mom being horrendous) and I fell in love, except that gf specifically forbid to do anything with her sis.
So obviously we fuck like rabbits, get closer sentimentally, never been so in love with anyone.
Except that she doesn't want me to be with gf. Neither do I in fact, but I can't bring myself to accept that it's going to hurt her,so her sis suffers a lot from the way I treat her and thinks I see her as a side chick when in reality I want to live with her and her only (I went non monogamous to dodge an eventual breakup with gf and that's really bad) but suffering for depression, anxiety and ptsd doesn't quite help with decision-making, to the point where one day, she attacks me physically. I didn't want to but I finally hit her back. I later learned that she was trying to kill herself with meds (she had a really shitty life but I keep telling myself that it's all my fault).
She leaves my house and moves to her dad's house (who's also an enormous mysoginistic and enormous prick). At this point I'm in constant pain because of the guilt and the shame. We still talk for like 2 months, we go through everything I did wrong. She says she forgives me and still loves me, but we don't talk until 4 months later. We see each other at her dad's place (which is also gf's dad, we went there for Christmas), and almost started making out. Kept contact with her, and we started making plans to see each other again in a safe place. We see each other 2-3 days/month until April, everything goes way better than before,end even though I'm even deeper in my psychological issues and had suicidal tendencies, I still managed to improve a lot on transparency and communication. Gf and I live in separate places since April (I couldn't stand living with her and I wanted a safe place for her sis to come, but I still couldn't admit to her that I wanted to break up, but tbh) and sis moved out of her dad's house so we see each other more regularly, but it's still incredibly difficult for her to be with me since I'm still with gf and can be sometimes crushed and urged by gf's emotionally abusive behavior out of fear of hurting her and also because apart from that, I still want her in my life as a friend.
Today I had a panic attack and felt the urge to stuff as much food as I could in me but I can't even bring myself to make something to eat, and that's when gf called. I told her about my issue and she came to pick me up. I eat there, and around midnight I notice that I left my phone in gf's car. I go back to retrieve it when I see messages from her sis. I was like ""fuck, what am I doing, I really want to be with her"" so I tell her what's going on and I tell gf that I feel better and leave as soon as I can.
As soon as I get home, I call her sis and she's really sad and angry against me. I get that, I really handled all of it pretty poorly. I'm so afraid to lose her but and nothing hurts me more than making her suffer but I can't bring myself to break up with gf, I need meds to be able to get out of bed, I'm in a dire financial situation and I feel like an horrible human being.


TL;DR : I'm a depressed and anxious dumb fuck having an affair with my abusive gf's sister, and I want to break up with my gf but I'm too stressed out and afraid to do it and my relationship causes her sister lots of suffering, I hate myself and I want to die",TIFU by being a dipshit
tifu,"This didn’t happen today, but yesterday in class we were playing Kahoots we created about the stuff we learned about this year. After one of the games, I decided that I was going to do something as just a little joke (a very stupid joke.) 

I put my name as Ben dover. 

I could see the shock on some of my fellow classmates faces when Ben dover was on the screen. I wasn't gonna be dumb and keep my name as that so I quit the game and rejoined with a new name. 
When the new game started I got the first question correct and Kahoot decided to fuck up. 

Ben dover was number 1 on the leaderboard! 

The teacher obviously noticed this and yelled something along the lines of ”whoever put their name as that better change it or they’ll go right to the office.” The whole class went silent and I quickly quit the game.

My heart was racing and I became super paranoid thinking that the teacher was gonna ask who did it and I’d get caught. I’ve never gotten in trouble ever before in that school so I’m sure my teacher didn’t suspect me at all.  

I’m the class after this everyone was asking “who was Ben dover?” I didn’t want to tell anyone cause I was scared of getting in trouble. But a girl came up to me and asked if I was Ben dover and I didn’t want to lie so I said yes.

tifu," 

A little backstory:

I have this tree company I've worked for the past two summers between semesters of school. They always require you to take two drug tests before you start working, one for their contractor and one for the company itself. Every year I've worked there I've smoked weed constantly, at least once a day even if it was a one hitter. Every year I tell myself I'll stop in march so that I can start at the beginning of May because their process of hiring takes three weeks generally. I've always managed to get away by quitting for the month of April until I take my second test and I'm clear to go. This year was only different because I stopped five days into April.

I was nervous for my first test and took precautions by taking B12 vitamins and drinking lots of water. This way I can pee, it's diluted, and the B12 vitamins make my pee yellow. I took the first test 2&amp;1/2 weeks ago and was forty two days clean. I wanted to make sure I'd pass.

Fast-forward to today.

I was given the Ok after I filled out paper work to take my second drug test at their designated location. I was very confident considering I've been clean now for sixty days. I woke up later than I wanted to around 11am and went to the bathroom and cleaned out the tank. I decided I'd take my test an hour and half after so I drank a few cups of water and figured I'd have enough to fill the cup up.

B o y w a s I w r o n g.

I stepped in their a bit nervous because I always get nervous with drug tests but especially because I didn't feel the need to go but I figured once I step in the bathroom I'd be ready to go.

Once the girl gave me the cup and instructions I walked in their and took off my pants and got ready.

I had about half the necessary amount before I stopped but I figured I could force some more out. Turns out by flexing my ass and giving that good push we all feel I felt my asshole start to squirt a lil chocolate goo. I wasn't even done filling up the cup and had already dropped a small morsel so I figured there was nothing to lose. I kept pushing and as I filled the cup I filled my pants with more goop. Once I had barely met the required line and had not peed anything into the toilet it finally hit me with what I'd done.

If any of you have taken a urine test you know that there is actually no use for the toilet except urine but at least there was some toilet paper. I grabbed bundles and bundles and filled my crack with them because I still had to sign my cup and talk to the girl who was administering me the test. Can I also add I was wearing Hanes boxer briefs with cargo shorts on so there was no net/webbing underneath to catch any droppings. I walked out of there shaking and realizing the embarrassment that was to come as I whispered to her with shame that I had shit myself while taking the test and that I was hoping we could wrap this up quickly so I could go clean up in the bathroom that was in the lobby. Any moment I was waiting to find a pebble on the white floor while squeezing my cheeks together. She sorta understood and finished the signing and gave a copy and I booked it to the lobby bathroom where I had seen what had truly happened.

I threw those boxers away in the bathroom and walked out with shame even though I don't think anyone truly understood what had happened.

tifu,"This happened actually yesterday but the problem is still ongoing. For some context, I got my IUD on the 21st of May and it was going smoothly up until yesterday around 12 pm when I experienced some of the worst pains I've ever experienced. I couldn't tell what was wrong but my ovaries were just in agony. It felt like every few minutes I would have some sort of contraction. I called my doctor for some suggestions on what to do as I'm out of state at the moment and couldn't get to them. They said contractions are normal for girls who haven't given childbirth and the pain was to be expected, if it got worse to go visit a clinic. 

I tried ibuprofen and midol but neither worked so I decided to go to the clinic as the pain continued to grow. Once I got to the clinic I could feel my teeth and fingers buzz with pain. It was very hard not to cry as I spoke to the desk attendant and signed the forms. The clinic doctor told me that I should try the ER at around 3pm to get an ultrasound to see if my IUD was twisted or anything like that because if it was then it could be life threatening. 

Well shit. 

I went to the ER after she suggested that and it felt like the pain kept worsening. It was a solid ten, and at best it could be an eight. The moment I got to the ER and filmed at the forms the nurses there had me get my IV, shots, ultrasound, and a pelvic exam all very quickly which was nice. Apparently I was stat ER due to the amount of pain I was experiencing. I was very nervous to know what was going on with me until the doctor there told me that I had a cyst on my right ovary. 

It made so much sense so that's what I went with. I remember them giving me some meds to take home to help with the pain and nausea. I was relieved to know it wasn't the IUD and just a really bad ruptured cyst. So I went back to my uncle's where I've been staying to take my meds. 

But that's not where it ends. In fact, it managed to get worse. 

As hard as I tried, I couldn't keep the medicines down. Not even the one for nausea. The pain actually grew everytime I tried to take something to help. I was in absolute tears from the intense pain. I couldn't calm down and at 10 pm I returned to the ER in worse condition than before. I didn't think they'd be able to do anything for me but I had to do something. So again, I was stat ER, new IV but no blood work or ultrasound. Another doctor says they'll do their best to make me feel better but this time the pain meds just won't work. I feel drowsy but the pain kept me up. I couldn't even cry I was so exhausted, I just remembered I wanted to sleep so terribly. The doctor thought they'd be able to help but suggested I stay the night as they got the gynecologist for some suggestions. 

I met with the gyn soon after and she offered two things. The first was to stick with the pain and try more pain meds, the second option was to get surgery to remove the cyst. The surgery wasn't guaranteed to work and could have a part of my ovary removed, but still I'd do anything to get out of my pain. So I agreed to the surgery. I remember getting into the stretcher and everything but right before the actual anesthesia and mask I was already asleep. 

I woke up the next morning feeling a lot better so I assumed the surgery had worked. I was wrong. A doctor came into inform me that while the surgery did take place they didn't bother with the cyst. Instead, they found the actual issue. Enteritis, a small intestine infection. If I hadn't gotten the surgery I probably wouldn't have ever known. That's what had been causing all this pain all along. 

That's where I'm at right now, stuck in a hospital bed taking pain meds and on antibiotics. I may have to stay another night but I feel so much better now than I did yesterday. I just wish that I somehow had gone sooner or found out sooner so I wouldn't have had to experienced so much pain. 

TL;DR: I thought I had an issue with my IUD and it was causing severe contractions. Went to the clinic and then the ER to find it was a ruptured cyst. After their pain meds for home didn't work I returned for some more help where I went through surgery to find out it wasn't the cyst but an intestinal infection.",TIFU by thinking my IUD was giving me contractions
tifu,"I (a dude) was selling something from Offerup today. Met the guy, seemed chill, took the cash, we parted ways. He mentioned to me he needed some technical help with the stuff he bought when he got home, and I told him I'd help him out.

So I went to work afterwards, during my break I saw he texted me some pics and some questions about the item. I answered them basically confirming everything was gonna work okay, and I thought that'd be it.

So then I get off work... And I see this huge string of texts from him. First he says the thing he bought wasn't compatible with his phone and that he'd get something else...

Then he asked me if I was bi.

I don't know wtf I was thinking but I thought he was asking if I was transgender. If I knew what he was *actually* asking... Well, I would have known what his intent was and just ignored it.

But, considering what I thought at the moment I felt compelled to answer, since I did know the thing I sold him could be used with a phone, he just needed an adapter for it. Also wondering why he asked if I was transgender, and having a suspicion it had something to do with my appearance. So I told him that, and also told him I wasn't 'bi' and was wondering why he asked.

He thanked me for the advice... Then said he was 'just wondering' and told me he ""took notice of something in my trousers.""

Yup. Don't think I'm wearing those jeans again lol.

So, I'm an 18-year-old uncle for two kids but my Nephew is the person of interest here. Let's call him ""M"".

&amp;#x200B;

So, I was visiting my sister and a thing I like to do for the kids is to give them a dollar or two each every time I visit so they can get themselves something. They really like me and always look forward to me visiting every month and I really appreciate that since I'm trying my best to be a good uncle.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I was visiting my sister and when I asked where is M, my sister told me that he dozed off on the couch after a long day of playing with his friends (he is a 4th grader).

After I greeted my sister and my niece, I decided it would be fun if I wake up M and surprise him... and surprise him I did.

&amp;#x200B;

Slowly and gently, I caressed his neck with my finger to try to simulate a fly and quietly whisper his name in his ears. Then, he gave a quiet whimper before finally opening his eyes.

Suddenly, he gave a scared scream before he K.O'd me to the ground with a punch straight to the cheekbone. My sister couldn't stop saying ""Oh my God!"" and ""Are you okay!?"" while helping me out, my niece was laughing her ass off, my nephew was shocked, and here I am, laying on the ground, looking at the ceiling, couldn't feel the left side of my face, and contemplating what the fuck did I just do.

&amp;#x200B;

Embarrassed, I jokingly told my sister that M has a future in Boxing in an attempt to brush things off. M was apologizing a lot to the point of crying explaining how my T-shirt scared him while hugging me. (My T-shirt did have any art on it. Maybe because it was new and made me look like a different person?)

&amp;#x200B;

I then tried to calm him down and tell him it is okay while having a lengthy talk about reflexes (which naturally went over his head). Thankfully, he took it well and didn't hate his dumb uncle for his god damn idiocy.

The first time we meet up, i go over to his cousins house where he’s staying. He turns on a playlist, dims the lights, and we start talking, drinking, and making out. Things are getting hot as fuck.

Disclaimer, I was reminded of this story after reading the story about the guy who asked the Bosnian boyfriend if he'd ever killed anyone. 

Also disclaimer, this FU was my son, not me. It was also in the early 2000s.

My son was studying WW2 in middle school and had to do a very in depth report about any battle. He chose Midway. 

He was proud of what he learned and was really into it. 

One evening, we took him to the local teppanyaki restaurant (cook at table). We had a great chef who appeared to be around the age to have been in the Japanese military. 

My son didn't put 2+2 together and as the chef cooked the meal, my son struck up a conversation with him about Midway. He went into demolish about all the specifics, death toll, how it was a turning point, etc.  

The chef just kept cooking and nodding. 

My son then asked him if he had ever heard about Midway, and the chef said that yeah, many of his family was killed in that and other battles in the war. 

My son, still not realizing who he was talking to, said something to the effect of, ""I'm just glad we won, and they kind of deserved it ""

This whole time, I couldn't think of any easy way to get him out of the conversation so I sat there with wide eyes.  I also didn't want to embarrass my son, so I failed to interrupt. 

The chef took it well, and was actually very gracious when I took him aside to apologize. 

Of course, now that my son is older, when we see a Japanese person, we always (privately) joke with our son and ask him if he wanted to give any history lessons...

My sisters were teenagers in the prime MSN age, when everyone with a laptop and windows XP/Vista would have it with all those awful animated emojis and the lot. (That laughing woman one still haunts my ears) I had never been into it because my dad bought us an xbox 360 on release and that was my thing, he didn't care how much I used the xbox so long as I never used MSN. He hated it with a passion, too much so, because both sisters had let it consume their life. He warned me never to use it so many times and I never had any intention to use it because I had xbox live and nobody around my age was using it anymore (Bebo was popular at this time)

I was a little shit bag, back in the days of Call Of Duty: Modern Warefare 2 you could obtain certain camo's from headshot kills. Blue tiger, red tiger and fall. If you had fall you knew you were balling. So some savy kids (myself included) would send out messages to recent players claiming to be able to hack, and would unlock things on their account if you gave headshots to your account. Long story short this got me banned and I was shitting my pants, so I decided to make a hotmail account to make a secret xbox forum account so My dad wouldn't find anything out. I asked why I got banned and had the explanation and naive 13 year old me thought I'd get unbanned. I didn't. The laptop I had at the time had MSN on it by default and it always popped up on startup and me being daft decided to log in \*once\* with this hotmail account to see what it was like. I never used it to message, add or contact anyone, but I logged in.

One evening Im doing homework in the frontroom with my parents and I finish and shut down the laptop. My dad asks to borrow it as it shut down so I say sure and turn it back on and log in. As the computer's logging in it hits me that the MSN will pop up with the hotmail account in the box... The only way I can describe the feeling... My anus puckered like a newly formed black hole. Expecting the shitstorm I started walking out to be shouted to come back. My dad lost his shit, asking what the hotmail was for and why i'd been on msn.

tifu,"This happened yesterday afternoon. 
To give a little background, all my life I (30f) have had your typical dust and animal hair allergies as well as mild childhood asthma but nothing too serious has come of it. I have a small closet in my house that I used to put clothes in but is now used for storing my large collection of craft supplies. Whenever I would put on an item of clothing that had been in that closet I would have an allergic reaction. Itchy eyes, itchy throat, mild hives on the parts of my body that touched that piece of clothing. So nix the clothes storage in THAT particular closet and things are better. Haven't had that kind of problem for a while.

Anyways.... so this week my husband is out of town working about 2 hours away. I live out in the middle of nowhere on hundreds of acres of land with only 2 neighbors relatively close by. All of my family lives a couple of hours away as well. So when my husband goes out of town for work I feel pretty isolated.  
I'm not feeling great today. It feels like a cold is coming on and my period is coming too,plus my anxiety of being alone makes for a crappy combination. I try not to let my kids ( 1.5 yo girl and 5 yo boy)  see my anxiety and I try to have fun with them during the day. 
My son and I decide to have craft time. He's been wanting to make some arrows and a quiver to put them in.  I love the idea and get really into it. I go to the craft closet and get everything we'll need. Paper, tape, etc. I also have a box thats packed with feathers. Mostly feathers I've found on the property from our chickens and some that I've bought.  I take everything to the kitchen table and things are going great. We're about halfway done and I open up the box of feathers. All of a sudden I cannot stop sneezing. And then my voice is suddenly completely gone. I cannot even whisper. Think ""Phantom of the Opera"" when they switch out the Diva's throat spray. My throat is so itchy, it feels like its swelling shut, its hard to swallow, I cant clear my throat and I think

 ""ohshit,whathappensifmythroatclosesupandIdie""

What will happen to my kids? 
I try not to panic.
I can still breathe, but something is seriously wrong. I dont have health insurance so I hate to be charged for an ambulance but I decide to call 911 just in case.  A lady answers and I can't even say hello. I try so hard to even croak out a whisper and its freaking me out that I cannot communicate with her. 

Luckily this is a rare moment when both of my kids are content watching cartoons and I dont have to worry about them. The 1 year old is strapped down in her high chair and my five year old is eating a popsicle that I somehow managed to distractedly open up for him in the middle of my 911 call.  

I painfully croak out my name and address to the operator and the ambulance quickly arrives. I go outside and they take me into the ambulance parked in my driveway to check me out. First they check my oxygen and say it's at 100%. Thats a relief. Then they look inside my mouth and dont notice any obvious swelling of my throat or tongue.  Is that i flicker of a smile I see the EMT trying to hold back? I feel foolish for calling for nothing but it was worth it to have the peace of mind that my throat wasn't going to continue to swell. They said everything was fine and that I wasnt having an anaphylactic reaction (but damn what was it?) (feathers) I was shook but glad it wasn't as bad as I thought.

I love tattooing and being with my coworker but he made it intolerable.
Anyway. Boss = selfish asshole 
Today I went to go see a coworker and unknowingly signed up to come back because I am a pushover. When the boss walks in he sees me. Glares. Asks how I'm doing and doesnt wait for the answer. (I havent seen either of them for over 3 months) I tell him I would like my job back but part time. (1. He doesnt pay me. 2. I can only stand him so long.) He continues to say he needs full time and that I need to be mentally ready and promise him I'll stay and not leave again. Understandable I guess...
So i left with the thought that I'm never visiting again. 
Now I am sitting in bed at 11:50 ranting to my phone having multiple panic attacks about the whole ordeal
Ps. (Mentally ready) I blamed leaving on my depression. Although I was having suicidal thoughts while working there so it wasnt a complete lie.
TL;DR
My boss is an ass. I came back to the parlor to say hi. Hes still an ass. Now I'm panicking I made a pety decision about leaving and I hate life choices.

tifu,"The fu happened about two weeks ago and not actually today. 

May is almost certainly my favourite month. My sisters birthday is on the 27th, my grandmas birthday is on the 28th and my brothers birthday is on the 29th. This means plenty of delicious desserts and fabulous suppers. For three days straight we get to gorge on whatever delicacy the birthday person has requested for the evening. 

The best part? The desserts. My family isn’t huge on dessert and we only ever have it for special occasions so I drool, grab my sweats and am ready when those three fateful days come in May. 

This year on my sisters birthday my mother made a delightful, crumbly apple crisp. When it was finally time for dessert we did the usual happy birthday singing.  I dished out the dessert to my family and realized we were short one metal fork. No big deal, I’ll use a plastic one! 
Then I took my piece of warm, beautiful apple crisp and a scoop of vanilla ice cream and went to sit on my deck to enjoy the flavours in peace.

I’m sitting on my deck enjoying the vanilla from the ice cream mingling with the cinnamon from the apple crisp. The tang of the apples, the softness of the dessert when I hit something - crunchy. 

I decide to continue to chomp down, powering through the crunch and focusing on the flavours. I didn’t want to embarrass my mom, maybe she dropped a nail in it? I didn’t want her to worry so I quickly ate the rest of my dessert (enjoying every bite, crunch or not). 

When I was almost finished I realized it was getting harder to scoop the dessert. I looked down and my fork had one less piece. 

In my haste to consume a delightful apple crisp I had literally eaten a chunk of plastic fork. I didn’t even realize I had eaten it. I went inside and told my family about it, thinking it was hilarious.

My mother panicked and tried to get me to go to the hospital and I spent the next half an hour of my sisters birthday celebration trying to convince everyone I would be fine and would eventually poop the bit of plastic out. 

TL;DR: TIFU by being so excited for the birthday week in Mays delicious desserts that I chomped down and ate part of a plastic fork in my haste to consume said delicious dessert. Then spent half an hour convincing everyone at my sisters party that I didn’t need to go to the hospital and I would eventually poop it out.",TIFU by eating a delicious dessert.
tifu,"Yes this happened 4 years ago. Yes this is an alt account. 

I was a junior in high school. Dating a beautiful girl. We hadn’t yet had sex but I knew it was coming. On this very day her parents were not home.

Her dad is a cop which kind of sketched me out because they have an alarm door system that notifies when people enter/leave the house so I always came through the side gate and through a window. Basically, no one knew I was there.

Anyways, I get to her house, take a piss, and get into bed with her where we “watched TV”. I was watching TV on the inside of her ***** with my mouth when we hear a *ding ding* from the alarm meaning someone has entered the house.  Holy shit. 

“Get in the closet! OP, quick!”  So I go get into the fucking closet like the scene from Pirates of the Caribbean where Elizabeth hides during the raid. I’m peeping out the through the blinds while my girl goes to see who it is, taste of muff still in my mouth. 

I was in there for about 10 minutes, just kind of relishing in this comedic scenario, planning my escape through the window, when I realized I fucked up.

“Who the FUCK left the toilet seat up? Fucking disgusting.” She sounded pretty pissed.

Not only did I leave the seat up in a house full of girls, but I forgot to flush my piss down too. I just was too excited to eat pussy. Well, at least her sister is super chill.... so I opened the closet door and walked out. 

“Sorry that was me,” I said. My girl and her sister just kind of stood there. 

“Oh, OP is here.”

After a quick awkward silence, her sister asked if we were fucking and she said no. Needless to say I was not really in the mood anymore so I dipped.  Relationship lasted 3 months. 

TLDR: hid in a closet, got exposed cuz I left the toilet seat up.",TIFU by leaving the toilet seat up at GF’s house
tifu,"So this happened a little while ago to a friend of mine, just popped into my head and still makes me crack up.

He shared a flat with me and a mutual friend of ours. Me and mutual friend were chilling in my room in the flat when all this happens.

Basically, he is chilling out with his girlfriend in his room, watching TV and generally messing around. After some time they're chilling in bed and he has to visit the bathroom. Once he's in there doing his thing, he suddenly gets the urge to choke the chicken to some porn on his phone. No idea why he didn't just have sex with his girlfriend who is in bed with him but whatever that's his drama. Suddenly we start hearing moaning coming from his room, but we already heard him going to the bathroom (he's fat and a heavy breather). We're thinking holy fuck she's doing her thing without him!! Obviously we turn the TV off to get a better listen. Next thing we hear is her shouting his name, but the moaning is still happening simultaneously!! He's in the bathroom watching porn without realising his phones connected to their Bluetooth speaker and she's listening to his porn!!! Funniest thing was he tried to claim it was the neighbours but we don't have any! We still roast him for this to this day and forever.

TLDR: friend went for a cheeky wank in bathroom but forgot phone was connected to Bluetooth speaker which was left in the bedroom with his girlfriend.",TIFU because technology...
tifu,"So I went to my grades high school end of the year party, I’m kinda new to my grade and this was my second party at this school. I chilled at the party had some vodka and eventually got lightly drunk, this was all ok until a friends like “Nico want to hit the bong?” I’m not a smoker, I’ve hit a couple danks and smoked a bit of grass before but my tolerance is super low and I really just wasn’t feeling it but I gave in and decided to hit it. During the course of the party I hit it a grand total of 5 times and felt perfectly fine until I hit it the sixth time, it was like a fucking hammer to the back of my head. I start stumbling around like I’m piss drunk, I wasn’t the only kid that was like this and a couple other people were puking in the back but I felt like I was the most noticeable. Eventually I lay down on some chairs, my friends are to my left and to my right are the group of girls that organized the party (including my crush). I chill there for a while until suddenly I feel that sensation in my stomach that indicates I need to puke so I get up to try to head to a private location to empty my guts. Unfortunately as soon as I get back I projectile vomit all over the back yards tile floor, some gets on the chairs some gets on a girl sitting next to me (thankfully one of my best friends) but most of it gets on me. My friend grabs the hose and sprays me down in front of everybody and I’m getting [this ](https://imgflip.com/memetemplate/42242898/Awkward-Party) look from some of the chicks at the party, eventually i lie back down and everybody just kinda ignores me.

tifu,"Literally happened ten minutes ago, the fallout has yet to happen.


Bit of a backstory, I (26M) live about 45 minutes from my parents house, and my eldest sister (30F) lives across the street from me but works close to my rents.


My parents, and my youngest sister (15F) are out of town on vacation. Now, I generally go to my parents house to work on my truck (my dad has spent a lot of money on his truck, and thus has a well stocked garage. Plus I live in an apartment complex and don’t have a garage).


So I’m going over there to do a few things, put some braided stainless brake lines on, and do an oil change.


This is where it happens. Now, my parents have two dogs. And I was trying to sneak into the house and being as quiet as possible, as I knew my eldest sister was house sitting and I didn’t want them to lose their shit.


This is where the fuckup happens.


It works. I’m quiet. I sneak into the house, and silently close the door. I heard some strange noises coming from the living room, so I go, thinking the dogs were playing.


It was not the dogs playing.


It was, in fact, my eldest sister and her boyfriend. On the couch.

With her sitting on his lap facing away from him, towards me with her eyes closed.


I have now seen my sisters birthday suit being penetrated by her boyfriend.


I also now know what my sisters face looks like in this process. 


And what she sounds like.


I literally screamed “my eyes” covered them and ran out of the house.


I’m outside, sitting in my truck contemplating my life.


Send help.



TL;DR Parents home is vacant other than my sister dog sitting. Went to work on my truck, saw my sister getting worked on, reverse cowgirl style.


Edit: Based on a lot of the responses, apparently reddit wants me to either A) Describe my sisters tits, B) Make a porno, or C) Go all r/sweethomealabama with her.
Y’all are animals.

Edit 2: Holy shit this blew up. Damn. What happened after was as I was sitting in my truck, they left. I went into the garage and did my work. We haven’t talked yet.

No i didn’t snort it like cocaine.

I was having dinner and eating Spaghetti, i had a bad day and was stressed, Already stressed that I had nothing to cook but spaghetti. I hate tomato sauce, its really acidic and sour (i added hot sauce + pepper in for taste)

I exhaled midway through slurping spaghetti cuz it tasted like shit, then I inhaled real fast and slurped some noodles but 1 noodle went wild and went up my nose while I inhaled.  So atleast 2-3 inches of noodle was up my nose. I just stopped breathing and thought “fuck this could get lodged into my brain or some shit” and panicked. 

Thankfully it was long enough for me to physically pull it out, but the peppers i added into the sauce didn’t do any fucking favours for my nose.

tifu,"This happened almost two years ago now, but boy does it feel like it happened today. This has to be one of the weirdest moments of my life and my first TIFU that I feel warranted reddits wrath. 

So my SO and I decided to climb Mt Fuji during our visit to Japan, now I already successfully climbed it years ago alone, but I knew how important it was to my SO so we went for it. To save on time and money, we chose to not get a hut halfway thru the climb and instead start at night and climb all night long in time to witness the beautiful Japanese sunrise 2700 miles high. We arrived around 6pm before the sun went down, too early in hindsight

As we reach about halfway up the mountain by bus, we reach what is called the fifth station (where 95% of climbers start and the highest point that busses/cars can go) and it is fucking freezing. Like, super strong winds and bitingly cold after the 90 degrees we're used to so far into our trip. The shops begin to close and we are then forced to wait outside which, not gonna lie, sucks. After about an hour we decide fuck it, let's just leave early since last time I climbed there was a hut at the summit with hot drinks, fire pits, and friendly Japanese mountain folk to congratulate you on your successful climb (fuck up no 1).

The hike starts off great, feeling much warmer now that we're moving and get a great night view of Fuji city. After a few stations the winds start really picking up and a few times almost knocks us off our feet but we like to think we're tough people and forge ahead. At around midnight we're wet, freezing, and almost out of water (oh yeah we were underprepared, fuck up no 2). We reach one of the last stations/huts and meet a friendly Japanese man who informs us that due to the storm, the summit is not safe to ascend. We don't really communicate well and just say thanks, thinking he's being overly cautious. Fuck up number 3 by this point. Even though we're still too early to summit to time it at sunrise, we don't really have the option of sitting around and getting colder and by this time all the huts have closed. It's either keep climbing into stronger winds and more rain or turn back. Fuck that, we're finishers or some shit we tell ourselves so we keep going. Another hour or two and we're exhausted. I have runners knees and my knees are locking up and causing a bit of pain by this point. The last hour to the top is... Brutal. We see many people turn around and then no people at all. But we're fucking making it to the top, goddamnit. 

Finally we make it! Yay! Annnnnd here's where reality fucks us right in the face:
There's no one here.

Fuck.

The huts are closed. The rain is heavy, winds dangerous, and it's only about 2am, still hours away from sunrise. As the realization sets in that we spent the last of our energy dragging ourselves to the top under the assumption that there would be warmth and fluids, only to find a ghost town. It's one of those moments you think, '... How bad is this? Is this just bad or actually life or death bad? And do people in life or death situations actually realize it's life or death? Fuck it's cold!'

We're banging on doors, trying to open them all, knowing without shelter our only option was to go back down and it's a good hour from the next hut and that one is still closed anyway. Some people appear behind us but we're honestly too cold and tired to even care. Finally a door opens! My hubby and I, followed by our new friends, come inside and are greeted by one person. It's an awkward but sweet hello in broken English (he's French maybe?) as we barely can talk thru frozen chattering lips. We're in the outhouse, a long wooden building that's partially flooded and without insulation. It also smells how you would imagine an outhouse smelling. He offers us some of his food and he looks very calm as he casually explains he's been trapped here for 24hrs already. We think he's kidding but then it becomes apparent he's very happy to see other faces and he's very cold. This might be the moment I realize this has now become likely a life or death situation, partly because we are now out of water and mostly out of food; we can't stay a day or even half a day, we have to save energy for the 6 mile trek back down the mountain in a crazy storm at night.

I sit down and immediately pass out. My SO and a few of the others that are stuck with us go exploring around. No one else is a native English speaker so communicating is very difficult. There's about 7 of us total I think. They find a bucket and some toilet paper. The man who's been stuck for 24hrs has a lighter. I think my SO saw my cold, sad face and it turned him into survival mode. He and the others started lighting the toilet paper on fire into the bucket for warmth, not an easy task at that altitude. (Fuck up no 5 now?) The others gather around, all now silently helping feed toilet paper into the flames to keep them going, not requiring communication because the biting cold is a common enough enemy to us all. I put my gloves near the flames, trying to dry them. There is hope amongst our group now, empowering us! We're going to make it!!

Annnnnnd heres the final and biggest fuck up:

I'm facing towards the entrance so I see him before everyone else. The face of an absolutely flabbergasted Japanese man.

""NANDAYO????"" He screams at us. We all turn and our lizard brains get wrenched back to normal and we realize exactly how fucked up what we're doing is. We all kind of back away and no one takes responsibility. The Japanese man runs forward and grabs the bucket, throwing it outside and putting the fire out. He comes back and has another man with him that doesn't look as angry but shocked. He continues screaming the same word at us (basically means ""What the fuck?"") and then starts demanding our passports, getting into each of our faces. He pulls out his phone and states taking photos of us. My SO sneaks away to grab our belongings and grabs my arm and tells me, ""Let's go."" I don't need to be told again. I think at this point the angry Japanese man realizes there's nothing he can do because we're all playing the 'I don't understand' card pretty hard and he yells at us to leave and everyone hustles out. The storm isn't as bad, still raining and windy but not as bad. One of my knees won't bend after being so cold and still so long so I hobble like my legs in a full cast as fast as possible, my SO almost lifting me entirely as we run away from the screams of the Japanese man. I'm thinking to myself, ""Well I never thought I'd be arrested in Japan. Will we serve jail time? Will we get to tell our story that our lives were at risk? Will they understand???"" 

The entire trek down was miserable. Exhausted. Cold. In pain. And fully anticipating being arrested after we reach the fifth station where the buses reach. I was terrified. I loved Japan. I felt so guilty. The man who had been stranded for 24hrs came up to us later, essentially asking us to 'get our story straight' and we simply told him, ""We worried for our lives so we did what we had to do."" He agreed emphatically but clearly he worried he was the most responsible since he'd told us when we arrived that he'd been trying to start a fire since he got there and it was even his lighter we used. He didn't want us telling the officials that obviously. But we were all complicit.

After another 10 hours or so we reached the bottom, fully expecting police to be waiting for us but there was nothing of the sort. We retrieved our luggage we'd put in storage and quickly bought tickets for the next bus outta town. The guilt was real and heavy but there was another part of me that was just happy we weren't blown off the mountain, injured, or anything else life threatening and not to be tortured by my knee anymore. I do wonder now if that angry Japanese man is still on the lookout for us all, showing our photos to police...

So take a little advice from me, an idiot: if you try to climb anything and the officials who live/work there tell you it's not safe, LISTEN TO THEM so you aren't forced to burn toilet paper for warmth and worry for your life.

TL;DR:
Climbed Fuji during the night, was told to turn around by officials due to bad storm, didn't listen cause 'wE iS sTrOnG', had to burn toilet paper in a bucket in the outhouse on top of Fuji to stay warm with a group of foreigners and then got yelled at by a Japanese man who wanted us arrested.",TIFU by burning toilet paper on top of Mount Fuji

So this happened 3 days ago, I was working on my front yard all day. We keep a small (but loud) Bluetooth speaker on the side of my house. It automatically connects to my phone when it’s in range as long as it’s on. Well I of course was listening to my favorite work out Spotify playlist while I was outside. My neighbor was working outside as well, we chit chatted here and there like usual.  

I decided it was time for a bathroom break and preceded to sit on the shitter while browsing twitter. I guess working outside in the heat got my engines going, so I got on porhub after I got done taking a dump... When I finally found a video that caught my eye the stupid sound wouldn’t working, I hit the volume up button multiple times and still no sound. My phone is jailbroken so I thought it was just a tweak not working properly or whatever. So I finished whatever I had to finish, washed my hands and walked outside. As soon as I walk outside I heard my music blaring through the BT speaker..... I then realized my phone had been connected to it the whole time I was in the the bathroom having fun. 

My neighbor was still outside and didn’t say anything to me for the rest of the day.

tifu,"I recently got a brand new truck and was super excited about the tech package that provided some really nice JBL speakers. I listen to music a little louder than the average person and I was really enjoying the sound system in my new truck.

Then about 2 months in I noticed that, for some songs, the driver side door speaker sounded muffled, and blown out. I could only play my music at a certain level before the speaker made listening to music less enjoyable.

I took it in to the dealership, 40 minutes away, to have them look at it. They replaced the driver side speaker for me for free since my truck was brand new.

I drive back home, not playing music too loud, as if this speaker is a human and needs some rest before it's fully healed. Then a week later I start playing my music louder and the exact same muffled sound comes back.

I let the dealership know and they schedule another appointment for me a month later. This time the dealership wants replace all the speakers in my truck and special ordered parts.

After a week of my truck in the shop I finally got to drive it home. I played a certain song where I knew the speaker was going to sound like garbage if the speaker hadn't been fixed... Just like before the speaker sounded like garbage and blown out.

I couldn't believe it and didn't understand how this speaker could already be blown out, there was no way in that short drive that my speaker could have blown out...

Then it hits me, my driver side door has a smartwater water bottle in the cup holder that's been there the ENTIRE time. I take the water bottle out of the driver side door and the driver side speaker sounds as good as new, no more blown out speaker.

The water bottle was vibrating against the side panel in such a way that it made the speaker sound as if it was blown out. I feel so dumb and I have yet to tell anyone about it.

TL:DR Bought brand new truck, speaker blown out a couple months in, got the speaker replaced, speaker still sounded blown out, got all the speakers replaced, speaker still blown, took the water bottle out of the door cup holder and speaker worked as good as new, the water bottle was no longer vibrating against the side of the door",TIFU by not taking my water bottle out of my driver side door for months

If I always tried my hardest he'd never barely ever win. So I let him win like half the time. But today when we were playing he finally figured out. After that he asked me how long I've been 'letting him win' I told him I've been doing it for years. Actually to add something the reason I'm so much better is because I like to learn the combo systems in the games I play. I like to get better at the game. He on the other hand just likes to do the special moves and supers and feel cool. But he's said in the past that learning combos is boring to him. After that he got sad and said he thought we were evenly matched. Now he knows that basically every match he's won against me is because I let him win. Now he told me he thought he was earning all those victories and now he feels hollow because he feels like he's never won a game against me for real. I only let him win to make him feel better.

So this happened a little earlier today, I work customer service so of course deal with all the ""amazing"" customers. Well this one customer came in and She was pretty angry because She wasn't able to reach our tech department when calling or reach our specific store. But She was complaining to me about how our phones suck and that She wanted to meet with one of tech guys. Well our tech guys are by appointment and since we only had one guy working for the night. He was busing helping another client and wouldn't be able to help for another 30 minutes. I explained this to her and She very quickly got mad, although it wasn't directed to me, so I ask a manager to come explain a little bit about policy and the customer tells my manager about her problems with the phone service. Eventually the customer came back to her senses and explained the problem with her laptop. She was worried about what her Brother (which She said was disabled, as she put it not completely there) was looking at online or downloading and any virus and what not . Well at that point since She was calm I offered to help look at the browsing history and any recent downloads her Brother may have downloaded.  So I open up the laptop and the screen, keys, everything is disgusting. There was all kinds of residue, which She said was from her Brother sneezing a lot, but looking back at it now it not it may have not just been snot. So I clean the keyboard and mouse-pad and have them login. I see the background and everything is normal, only problem is that there is 3 browsers downloaded, so I open up chrome first check the history and its clean. So tell her maybe her brother uses another one, I check Opera and clean again. Then I open up Edge and see that the history is clean again, so clearly her brother is clearing his history. I tell her this and inform her I don't know get back the deleted history. I do through check to see if He had downloaded anything recently and once again his download folder and history was cleared. I did check his recycle bin however and saw a lot of random files, a few saying virus protector. I don't open them through, but one last thought came into my mind I was going to check to see if any of the browsers had certain website permissions. So I check Edge first and I pull out my phone to check the websites myself if I don't recognize the urls, most of them were news websites and there was some random Australian website. Then I check one website with tube in it, I not really thinking about it  type it into my phone and get greeted by porn. Which didn't really shock me, until I saw the banner and realized it said animal porn, zooaphila, and bestiality. Then i process what seems to be a lady taking it from behind by a horse and quickly close the tab. I slightly shocked now just calmly tell that the website was porn, but with animals. The lady didn't even seemed phased by She knew exactly what I mean't and I told her a few options about virus protection and how we can setup some parental restrictions.  Lucky at that time our tech guy was free and helped them the rest of the way. After the customer left I ask our tech guy what was up and He said that the lady might have caught her Brother jerkin' the old crank to similar videos before.

tifu,"I work in pharmaceuticals and part of my job is preparing samples. The procedure for making these samples takes up close to an entire work day depending on how big the samples are. Its a slow process. I worked on a particular sample all day, started in the morning and was on the last part of it. Literally would have been finished in 20 minutes. I went to put my sample in an instrument that makes it easier to remove it from the tube it was in. This instrument is basically a vibrating water bath. 

Being the genius that I am, I put the sample (which was in an open glass tube) into the water bath but in a rack that was way too big and designed for bigger tubes. I did it before with tubes that were about the same size but had pointed bottoms and caps. This glass tube had a round bottom and, as mentioned, no cap. I'm sure you can tell where this is going but the tube slipped and ended up completely submerged in the water bath. The kicker is that this sample was radioactive feces so definitely not something you want spilling all over the place (don't worry, I cleaned it up).

**OBLIGATORY WARNING: MAJOR GAME OF THRONES SPOILERS AHEAD. DON’T READ AHEAD UNLESS YOU'VE FINISHED THE SERIES OR YOU WANT TO END UP LIKE MY FRIEND.**

So basically, me and my friends like to get together and play poker a lot. It’s a way for us to play some cards, get in some decent banter, and have a good time. Just as a bit of backstory I watched Thrones, but wasn’t a huge fan (I hated the ending), and another friend (we’ll call him Joe) absolutely loved the ending. I love to joke about how the ending was shit with him, and how he’s crazy for enjoying it and thinking it was “epic.” Also, Joe is really preppy (this is important later). My other friend (we’ll call him Steve) is up to Season 8, Episode 4, and he feels the same about the show as Joe (loves it).

So we’re playing cards, having a good time, and we start talking about how Joe is dating very seriously these days. So obviously what do we do? We start speculating what preppy names Joe is gonna give his completely theoretical offspring. We’re all joking, having a good laugh and then I go, “Well, Joe’s probably gonna name his kid after Jon Snow or something.” So we cycle through stupid GOT names to give Joe’s stupid preppy ass kid, and then someone (I cannot recall who) says “Man, Daenerys has gotta be the stupidest name someone could give to a child.”

**SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT**

\*Drum Roll Please, Fuck Up Inbound\*

My stupid fucking ass replies, “Nah, Drogon is the dumbest name for a child, because his stupid response to Jon Snow murdering his mother was to burn a fucking chair.” I swear for a split second none of us knew what had happened (I think Joe chuckled but can’t be sure). Then about a second later, Joe’s eyes just met mine like fucking darts, and Steve whimpers, “Who’s Drogon’s mother?…OH FUCK.”

I’ll be honest, my heart fucking sunk. I felt so bad, and all I could do was apologize. Given, I didn’t really like the show but I would NEVER have done that to anyone, let alone a good friend. This was all accentuated by the fact that two days ago my friends found out that James Holzhauer lost Jeopardy! the morning of, but didn’t spoil it for me (I was really enjoying his run, they couldn’t care less). It was an absolute shit show, and the mood for a fun poker night was completely ruined. Yeah, I’m a moron. If you’re reading this Steve, I’m so sorry.

TL;DR: My friend loves GOT and was about to finish, I was poking fun at a different friend who had already finished the show, and I let slip what happens in the finale.",TIFU by Spoiling Game Of Thrones For My Friend and Ruining Poker Night
tifu,"This actually did happen today, or rather the fallout did. I’ve been with my job three years, and work in a block of eight cubicles. Twice a week, the cleaning company comes through and empties trashcans, wipes down desks, vacuums, etc. in the evening after most people have left. It’s a husband and wife team and the wife always cleans by me so we chat while she does her work and I do mine. After three years of these quick chats, we are pretty comfortable with each other.

She told me that one of the employees where I work had sexually harassed her, and was only deterred from taking it further by her husband’s intervention. She didn’t want to file a complaint or tell anyone but she was really scared of this guy. He quit the company on okay terms, and they have started bringing back a lot of the old employees that left to fill new, higher up roles. 

I didn’t want this guy to be one of them, so I told HR. She was glad I had made her aware of it, and apparently there had been a lot of rumors about him doing skeezy creepy molesty stuff but nobody had come forward for sure.

I come in this morning and have an email ripping me a new one. It’s from my boss, and she says that I should have gone to her first (neither of the two people involved were in her department), I’m wasting everyone’s time, I need to only worry about myself, and the cleaning lady is an adult who can handle herself without my help. I’m also told that it looks to management like we have been having lengthy conversations every day with neither of us doing our work so HR reported me to my boss and the cleaning lady got reported to hers. I emailed the boss back and told her it had nothing to do with her department so I didn’t go to her, I don’t feel like reporting this is a waste of time or at least it shouldn’t be, I will worry about people in horrible situations, explained that it’s possible to have a conversation while she’s in my eight cubicle block that doesn’t distrust either of our jobs, and I take full responsibility for any trouble anything caused. I also did not help my boss when she was being attacked by a wasp in her office, a wasp she’s allergic to, because I was only worried about myself and she’s an adult and can handle herself.

tifu,"When my roomate woke up at 3am from the smell of garlic coming through my dick

I am horny person and I look for every opportunity to fuck. It was a warm sunny day and I get a random Snapchat from this girl I hooked up with long time ago, and did not seen her ever since. She snapped a picture of her hot body with massive boobs and thick ass in front of mirror wearing yoga pants and sports bra, she wrote “ I am famished “. Being horny, I seized that opportunity and played my charm and asked her out for dinner, hoping for a good fuck after. 

So in the next 30 mins since her snap we are at Buffalo Wild Wings. I bought her couple of drinks and we were easing into the conversations as to not make it awkward about not seeing/talking to each other ever since we hooked up. We were doing well and we ordered some garlic bread and Parmesan Garlic wings, she loved garlic for some reason and I didn’t care care as long as I got to fuck her. 

We got along well, had great conversation and I could sense that she was really into me. I wanted a good fuck bad , right after we were finished eating I payed the bill, I hold her hand and without saying a word we start walking back to her place.  

5 mins later we are at her room and without wasting much time I cut through the chase and  start making out with her. I take off her bra, as I am right about to take off her pants she stops me to tell me she is on her period. I was a little disappointed but my dick so hard it was about to explode and I needed to bust a nut fast. So I convinced her to blow me instead and she agreed. With my dick hard as a rock, she sucked my dick like a vacuum with her stroking motion made my horn-dogs calm. Apparently she liked the taste of my dick and went on to blow me couple of more times that night. 

When my nut sack was no longer able to produce any more sperms for the night, I decided to go back to my place went straight to sleep In my boxer. My roommate comes back from his day soon after me and he too goes to sleep. Now it’s 3 in the morning and the whole room smelled like garlic, it got so unbearable that my roommate woke up to spray entire bottle of Fabreez and 2 hours later the smell reappeared, he couldn’t sleep rest of that night.

The next morning when my own stench finally got unbearable and it woke me up, I was more  amused that my dick had the power to erect my deep sleeper roommate. When all the alarms failed my dick prevailed 😂.

TL;DR took a girl to dinner and ordered garlic bread, went to her place where she blew me. I go back to my room and sleep, my roommate wakes at 3 am from the stench of garlic.",TIFU when my deep sleeping roommate work up at 3am by the strong stench of garlic coming from my dick.

This happened like 10 minutes ago and I'm laughing at the thought of finally having something to post here.

I couldn't sleep which I often can't so I thought why not polish the meat scepter since it's been a while. I took my time doing the deed and eventually finished, leaving the tissue with the lobster sauce exposed next to my bed. Now I usually throw it away immediately but I thought I have time and I'll get it later.

He shakes me awake and I pretend to come to and after a bit if back and forth I notice his gaze at something besides me and what do you know, it's the tissue filled with future doctors and lawyers. He doesn't say anything about it and neither do I, trying to play it off like it wasnt anything important and he leaves. So I sit up, smack myself mentally, then laugh.

tifu,"This happened over the past two days and I can confirm it's been the biggest railroad of emotions and the worst 36 hours of my life (so far) and throw away due to my professional career.

I see a regular councilor for a compulsive addiction I have. Which is under control and I'm in recovery. During the course of our meeting the subject came up on self harm and thoughts of suicide.

Firstly I think I need to set the record straight I have never attempted to take my life or self harmed. But when the questions came I thought, yeah ok honesty is the best policy and I was honest and said yeah I've thought about it and thought about and how if I was going to kill myself how I would do it.

I also added that I would never do this due to the fact that I have way too much to live for and it'd be stupid and selfish to take my own life. 

The next think I know I'm being assessed by mental health doctors in a normal A&amp;E ward in a busy hospital, I could've walked out the door at any point. Then I was moved to a normal ward in the same hospital in a bed thinking the whole time will they hurry up and say I can go. I kept asking then if I'm allowed to leave and they're saying no not yet, I need to wait for the all clear from the doctor. 

The next thing I know two ambulance staff turn up to take me to a secure hospital and this is where it hits home. Thoughts running through my head can I leave? Have I been sectioned? Nobody has said I've been sectioned. But these two ambulance guys are treating me like it's a prisoner transport and at this point I'm starting to worry. 

They take me to where I'm going and it's a small tiny hospital with big thick metal doors, windows that grates over them. Doors that nurses need to open for you. Echoey corridors. The moment I got here anxiety just struck in. 

They kept calling me an informal patient but said I'm going to be here around 2 weeks and how my stay here was going to help me and get me on the right track. What right track as far as I'm concerned I'm absolutely fine.

After half a day of trying to settle and get my head round things I actually ask what's the process how long until I can leave and I'm told that I can leave whenever I want. 

This is so not the story. I'm at the point now where I've asked to self discharge and they've said yes that's fine and I've just gotten home. I'm tired, I smell, I've missed two days of work and I need to relax and cry.

This experience has meant that i'm never going to tell the truth to a mental health professional again. Yes I sometimes get those thoughts but I'll never act upon them. I made that clear and still nobody listened. 


Edit: just reading this back I missed the point that after they said I could go I had to wait for the ok from the doctor and the doctor had to also speak with my partner to confirm that I was telling the truth about having a warm safe home to go back too.


Tl;dr Told my councilor that I sometimes have thoughts of how I could kill myself if I wanted too and made it clear that I wasn't going to do it and spent 36 hours in hospital then a psych ward. Literally the worst 2 days of my life.",TIFU by being far too honest and ending up in a mental health hospital.

This isn't that dramatic, but I didn't die, and I didn't break anything, I just feel such regret and like a complete retard, because if it did fall on me, I would be the guy killed by a vending machine.

There was a co worker in the break room who couldn't get his chips out of the machine. I said ""ah that sucks"" . We tried hitting it, but we were not able to free it. I resorted to more drastic measures (Because: I'm a fucking retard who honestly ignores other peoples advice far too often and who thinks he knows better than everyone else ) and shook the machine. Well it did come loose and fall, and co worker got his snack and yippee yay. But. I still feel this sense of ""What the hell was I thinking. If that could have gone wrong and fell on me, I would have died over a bag of chips""

I have a coworker, let’s call him ‘D’, who always speaks in a total dead pan, monotone voice regardless of what he’s actually saying. It makes things even funnier when he’s trying to be funny, and sometimes, unfortunately, funnier when he’s not trying to be. Nonetheless, I love him to death and he’s such a friendly, genuinely sweet person to work with and be around. 

So, on this particular day, myself and two of my coworkers were outside chatting on our break and D decided to join us. He wasn’t really chatting much, so I decided to try and explicitly include him in the conversation, asking cheerfully “so what’s new with D? :)”. To which he responded in his typical, dead pan and monotone: “my grandpa just died”. 

Before I even had time to process what I had just heard, I BURSTED out laughing. I was absolutely mortified by my blatantly inappropriate response and immediately apologized. I would never purposefully laugh at someone for something like that, but the way he said it just caught me so off guard it just came out of me before I could control it. My coworkers think I’m a colossal dick, but D forgave me instantly. Goddamn, we don’t deserve him. Im still beating myself over this.

I get my snack, and go sit by a computer and watch some revision videos. Its about 1:45pm and all is well! I am feeling confident with my study and I'm ready for my steadily approaching exam!

I ran over to the exam building and was greeted by a little old lady. I told her what had happened, she looked at her watch and told me that I was too late unfortunately 

If I had been 10 minutes earlier I would have still been allowed in (you have a 45 minute period once the exam starts to get there late).

Safe to say I was absolutely torn. I've never missed an exam in my entire schooling years, and I'd missed it due to a stupid mistake in reading the time.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, thank you everyone for the kind words, support and personal stories. I want to address a few things, mainly because I wrote that while still, very much angry, at my fathers passing. Mods, please remove if not allowed.

&amp;#x200B;

1.) Getting in shape for your kids/SO/family

You have to want to do it for yourself, not anyone else. Sure, the family can be a great motivator, but you need to 

want to get better for you. You wont make permanent, meaningful progress, unless you do it for you. I ran that

gambit with alcohol after I came back from my deployment. If you do it for you, it will last. Making self   
improvements for others is futile. 

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Slow suicide

Most people dont understand obesity, the same way we understand alcoholism or drug abuse. Abusing food is 

just as bad, it just takes longer for it to take effect. Was I angry when my dad passed? Yes, hard yes. But I also 

feel sad for him, because he suffered in silence. I cant imagine what he was going through, and I am sad that

there was nothing we could do. Overeating and food abuse is a symptom of another problem. A problem that

can be fixed, but its a hard climb. People who are using food to cope need help. And we should be glad to 

offer it to an extent.

&amp;#x200B;

3.) The Excuses

This one is a little more personal, but the excuses have to stop. Because once you finally die, its either going to

cost more to cremate/bury you, or your hospital care is going to cost more. Those are costs that your family 

will end up absorbing in one way or another. At some point you need to learn how to value yourself more.

To love yourself more than that, because when its all over with, it can end with a long life or a short one that

leaves more questions than answers. Sure, a sudden death at a young age is great for the dead. But us living

are left to try to grip something to remember. 

&amp;#x200B;

4.) The Anger

Its okay to be a little angry, or even bitter towards the obese. But try and read and understand point 2. Sure,

the excuses are annoying as fuck. And sometimes they can get outright outrageous. But understand that 

people choose different vices to cope with problems. I sought mine in cigarettes, alcohol and over the 

counter drug abuse. While you cannot help someone who will not help themselves, you can offer words

of encouragement and support to those who just dont see what they are doing to themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

5.) Those who are trying 

Seriously, keep trying. Its going to be hard. Its going to feel impossible at times. But keep trying to get better.

It gets easier, you just have to do it every day. Even if its only a small amount, any kind of forward

momentum is progress. Keep that in mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

6.) Similar Situations

Thank you for sharing your stories, and your heartache and grief. This has been hard, harder than I ever

thought it would be. His passing has left an ache that will take time to soothe. I appreciate the stories

because like most things, its helps to know that you arent the only one. Keep moving forward.",Update to: Being Fat killed my dad
fatpeoplestories,"So I have a few stories about my boss but this one really sums her up. Let's call her Coughing Ham Boss (CHB); shes barely 5' and weighs at least 200 lbs, maybe 250 lbs and carries the majority of her weight in her biggo booty and tree trunk thighs, and is +/- 50 yrs old. (To be fair she is a cancer survivor and straight up boss, but it was years ago and according to her shes been steadily putting on weight for just as long, too - about 10 or 15 years.)

First, a quick background: CHB has a disgusting and health hazard habit of coughing and sneezing WITHOUT covering her mouth or turning her head.  She will walk all the way down the hall or go into the COMMUNITY KITCHEN WHILE THERE IS FOOD OUT and cough the whole time. Like, ""Oh this *cough* looks good. *cough cough* I'm gonna get a *cough* piece."" Never washes her hands and will cough open mouthed on the counter while grabbing a cookie. Apparently the coughing and weight gain is due to her ""meds and muh condishuns"" but the cookies....? Its one thing to be sick but I have literally seen her walk down the hall to the restroom coughing and NOT ONCE cover her mouth or turn her head.

Anyway CHB is always complaining about being tired, working long hours (which is another story why), gaining weight and *gasps* COUGHING so I decide to invite her to my gym. (I'm 5'4"", about 130 lbs, workout 4-5x/wk and practice krav maga. It's a martial arts if you dont know.) I invited her on like a Thurs or Fri and we were planning to go the following Monday. Oh, and since she was working later than me, I was planning to hang around the office for 30-60 min after I was done AND cut into my regular workout time so I could go in with her and workout together since she was feeling slightly intimidated to go alone. Sunday night I pack my gym bag, think about texting her a reminder but I figured if she's serious, she'll remember herself. 

Monday morning comes and I can tell CHB is in her office because I can hear her coughing and later when she comes out, I remind her about the gym. 

CHB: ""Oh, I forgot! You should have text me a reminder last night!"" I was like ""Oh yeah, next time then"" or whatever while thinking ""WTF?!?"" And she literally looked at me like I forgot to pick up the birthday cake for a party or something, like I missed a deadline on a big project like I really dropped the ball by not reminding to basically do something about her health for one evening. And then went right back to work and made NO attempt to reschedule or anything. 

(TLDR) So to recap, after listening to CHB complain about her weight and cough, I invite her to use a guest pass at my gym while planning to hang around the office (unpaid and not working), interrupt my regular workout routine and miss my krav maga class, but I'M the bad guy bc I didnt text her a reminder?? 

She could have set her own reminder or go to the gym on her own but I guess CHB enjoys lugging around a 150 lbs ass that has it's own zip code instead.",Ham Boss Blames Me for NOT Working Out
fatpeoplestories,"So I work in an office building with an open floor plan. It’s about half customer service agents and half other assorted departments. There is one manager in charge of one department and I am the manager of one of the others. 

The managers are all pretty much given free reign over how they choose to run their department, and so different departments have different rules. The owners don’t micromanage. One key difference is that I don’t want my employees eating at their desks, and the customer service manager doesn’t care. Predictably, the customer service reps each easily weigh 50-100 lbs more than anyone else at this office. Most are minihams. Every day I see them with full meals of Chinese food, pancakes, pizza, and the like. They also have department potlucks for every single holiday.

One Customer Service Ham (CSH) is absolutely enormous. He’s about 5 food 8 and probably over 400 lbs. He uses the handicap parking spaces, and I have never once seen him without an entire meal on his desk. He will finish one and go straight into the other. I’ve never seen him walk into the building without some sort of fast food in his hands. It’s very sad because he’s a nice guy. 

I’ve overheard him in conversations about how he’s going to loose all this weight, but he never elaborates on how he’s going to do that. 

This morning he was at his desk and I was walking behind him when I noticed a very large, open canvas bag on the floor next to him. It was absolutely bursting with containers of “megashred Rx” type powdered drink mixes, protein shakes, supplements, Metamucil, creatine, among other things that you’d pick up at your local sports nutrition store. On his desk was a shaker bottle with some sort of concoction inside. 

This poor guy seems to actually think that you can lose weight by just adding the right kinds of supplements to your diet on top of the regular crap he’s eating. 

I’d pull him aside and have a chat with him about this, but I really don’t want to wind up in HR.",Call Center Ham

She hadn't done many ham things except she kept calling herself fat around me and pausing, I'm assuming she expected me to reply with 'no you're just curvy' or something along those lines, she gave me some nasty looks when I just ignored her. 
So my last day with this company was yesterday, and of course I had to work with her. To put her size in perspective, my store is relatively small, the counter space is snug but I'm able to pass behind people easily. But when she works, I have to go around the entire counter because it's impossible to get past her without brushing against her. Now I've been really excited about my diet, I feel great, I look better every day, and I've found a love for cooking. So I started a conversation about food cause I was real excited about making buffalo cauliflower that night. She chimes in with ""I love vegetables, I know I dont look like it, but I do"", she then proceeds to tell me that she wasnt allowed to have vegetables when she lived with her family because her Mom was on a diet and was the only one allowed to eat the vegetables, and she was only able to have frozen meals and pizzas and that is why shes fat. Ok, I can understand poorer family's dont have the money sometimes for healthy food for a whole family, but it still seemed weird. But then she tells me that she has a 'condition' that makes her sick if she eats anything besides protein, meat and basic carbs. Ok again, she could be eating things like lean meats, fish, eggs, healthy cheese, whole wheat bread. Nope. Every week, she goes to her favorite pizza place at a different mall, buys 3+ pizzas and that's all she eats for the next few days because ""that's all I can keep down"". Assuming she eats one pizza a day, and each slice is 300 calories (I'm being generous and assuming shes only getting a medium cheese pizza) that's 2400 calories a day. Shes eating 400 calories a day over her needed daily calories and that only if she eats the pizza and doesn't drink anything with calories.",Ham coworker HAS to eat crap
fatpeoplestories,"Starting this year, my company began implementing a month long event called “Wellness Month”. Basically every two-three days we have fitness sessions such as bike rides, soccer, ab sessions, etc. for all the employees. This is just to promote better health and exercise habits and it’s a good way to just get out of the office and move around considering we’re sitting 8+ hours a day.
 
Now these events aren’t necessarily mandatory,  but it’s “highly recommended” to attend. Not showing up is a bad look. It’s a corporate environment, that’s just how it is. People notice. And judge.
 
The thing is, my manager is notorious for being a workaholic. She works long hours, rarely uses the paid time off benefits the company grants and has accumulated almost a months’ worth of vacation days.
 
Yet all of a sudden this month, she’s decided to finally take some days off. And she’s not taking whole weeks off, just certain days. She was out yesterday, not coming in Wednesday and Thursday next week, not coming in again Tuesday and Thursday in two weeks…
 
Well “coincidentally” the days my manager is not coming in, those are the days we have the fitness sessions. The only day she was here was for the free catered breakfast and lunch event. 
Technically she’s not doing anything against the rules, she’s a higher up so she could work from home if she needs to and she’s allowed to use her designated days off whenever.

Who knows? Maybe my manager likes to have intermittent days off. She’s just coincidentally taking days off where we have those fitness sessions. Kind of like the fat kid in PE who was always “sick” on the days we had to run the mile. It must be a coincidence.",Hamplanet manager coincidentally takes days off during company fitness sessions
fatpeoplestories,"not that crazy of a story but it drives me nuts. I’m fat too but I’m half the size of the people in question so I don’t have the capability to cause these problems. 

I work in a restaurant and both the aisles between the tables and the bar as well as the walkway in the kitchen are pretty narrow. My manager, who although very sweet is gigantic (prob around 5’5 and 300 lbs) will just stand in front of the place where food gets picked up by servers and it’s IMPOSSIBLE to get through to get silverware/plates/whatever.

Along with this, very fat customers will stand at the bar and block my way. I know the “customer is always right” but fuck, I’m already extremely self conscious of my own size and would never do anything where my body would cause someone else problems.

fatpeoplestories,"My friend was in his way to pick his gf up a couple of days ago and encountered this lovely woman in a gas station. She was about 5’5 and 300 pounds(at least). She was scarfing down a gas station burrito and holding a bagel in her other hand. She’s standing in front of him online and this is the conversation he overheard:

“I’m just picking up a quick snack before the bbq. Did you buy the chips I like?!? You know I need to have my chips. Did you pick up the case of Peanut No-Ear!?”

My friend and the gas station attendant exchanged a confused look after hearing her say this. She went on to repeat that last word several times before my friend finally realized that she was trying to say Pinot Noir. He told me he had a hard time not laughing. Also the “small snack” she had ended up being a burrito, bagel with butter, and a bag of her precious chips. All in all, probably 1000+ calories.

fatpeoplestories,"I have been anticipating this for ages, and now that it's come, I feel a sense of relief. Heffalump won't be working here anymore, and she received notice on Saturday. 

Our superior (Chris, not his name IRL), watched Heffalump's work performance for the whole two days he was on our floor. Occasionally, he would record her slacking off on a camera hidden in a desk plant so that he could send the footage to the higher-ups. He didn't record her all the time, because that would be somewhat creepy, but things he managed to record were;

a) Heffalump slacking off for ages after sending one file away (he made time-lapses)

b) coming back 15 mins after lunch break was over (she does this every day because 45 mins+ is rounded to 1 hour's wages) (this is annoying for lots of people because we work for every dollar we're given)

c) slacking off

d) wasting time, you get it

And so Chris sent the footage to his bosses, and although I don't know what happened after that until her termination, I'm sure they weren't pleased, looking at how fast her notice came in. Some of our departments need to work really fast, and 20-30 files a day obviously isn't cutting it. 

She was offered three options; another job on another floor, ditto, or to find work somewhere else. 

For the two jobs she was offered, one was somewhere in complaints and inquiries. She could sit in a chair for basically all day but work faster than we do for a bit less than what we get. As for the second transfer offer, I can't remember exactly, it was probably somewhere at the front desk in a sort of not-used-a-lot-but-essential department, where she could slack off all she wished but would be paid *much much less.* She chose to work in complaints and inquiries. Although Heffalump was definitely not the best of people, it's sad to see that she realized she has to work harder now that her pay is decreased. 

The most damnedest excuses she came up yesterday for her transfer were, 

""This job's not cut out for me."" (It's the other way, hon)

""MUH CUNDISHUNS restrict me frum wurkin' hurr.""

""I found something I like that's more challenging and will help me grow as a person blah blah blah."" (I almost laughed aloud when I overheard her)

She came by yesterday to settle her $100+ score with the snack bar, and her desk has to be cleared by tomorrow. Good luck to the cleaner having to deal with the candy wrappers and crumbs stuck in the deepest abyssal corners, and I hope the new person replacing her can beat her highest quota of 47. Or not invite themselves anywhere. John, with the injured leg, is glad he doesn't have to literally *compete* with anyone for the disabled toilet anymore. 

Well, that's all. Although a few things about her have been mildly amusing, most of them offended my sensibilities, and so I'm glad she's gone. 

Slacking off, no matter what type of person you are, says a lot more about you than what you let on, IMO. Work hard, because in most cases you'll get out what you put in.",Yeeeet Heffalump's gone

fatpeoplestories,"Situational context: I work in an office with approximately 350+ people. The majority of them sit in cubicles and people higher up the food chain get offices. Due to changing departments and staff coming and going it is sometimes necessary to shuffle staff around to ensure departments are housed together.

&amp;#x200B;

Story: It became necessary to move Joe from our department to a new department he had transferred to. This move would require him to be on the complete other side of the building. To make room for Joe it was necessary to move two other people closer to their departmental staff. One of these people is the office hamPLANET, who we will call Sheila. Sheila had been in the same office for four years. Sheila moves to her new office. Joe is preparing to move into Sheila's vacated office and lo and behold it reeks of urine! Without telling me exactly what to expect, Joe asked me to come by to see if he was just being super sensitive about an odd smell. He was NOT being sensitive! I could smell the urine outside the door and I told Joe ""Dude, this office smells like pee!"" Joe did not officially move to the office because it was literally uninhabitable.

&amp;#x200B;

Sheila is approximately five feet tall and around 550 pounds. She is able to walk with the assistance of a cane. But it is more like lurching as she wheezes to catch her breath from the shortest walk. She is larger around then her height. My guess is that her short arms are unable to reach her cooch to properly wipe after she urinates.

&amp;#x200B;

Joe asked Office Management to please clean the carpets, assuming maybe some pee accidentally got into the carpet. They call in an outside professional carpet cleaning company.  The cleaning has zero effect, so much so that Joe complained and thought they had not come to do the cleaning. The cleaning company comes back to try again. Also zero effect on this disgusting smell.

&amp;#x200B;

Joe refuses to move into the office until the smell is resolved. This causes an issue as someone is waiting to move into Joe's old office. The decision is finally made by upper management that they will pay to have the carpet removed and replaced. This is certainly not an inexpensive option but anyone visiting the office would undeniably understand that the office could not be occupied.

&amp;#x200B;

The new carpet solved the smell issue. But as Joe was moving into the new desk (in our office all the furniture is the same so it remains in the office it is assigned to and does not move when people move) he literally had to call building maintenance to bring a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment to suck up the tons of food crumbs in every nook and cranny.

fatpeoplestories,"  

I want to share this story for any fat people who may be lurking here, getting furious with the stories or trying to come up with a way to justify their lifestyle. And also, as a warning to other people who are still kicking the can on loosing weight. Mind you, I loved my dad. He was my stepdad but did more for me than my real father ever did. I love him, and miss him dearly. 

My dad died the morning of Memorial Day, or perhaps the evening prior. He had been overweight for as long as I had known him, roughly 12 years. He was in his late 50’s. Around half way through his and my mother’s marriage, they opted to get their stomachs stapled to help loose weight. Both were extremely overweight, were sedentary, and had poor eating habits. When the autopsy was performed on my father, it was discovered that his heart was 3 times larger than what it was supposed to be, and he had clogged arteries. So, as he was sleeping, his heart could no longer keep up with the strain of keeping his 350+ pound body alive, and gave out.

When it came time to have him cremated, an extra 100-dollar charge was lobbed on top of the bill due to him being a bariatric patient. While I will always be thankful that it was a painless death, that he never saw coming. I cannot help but think that he would still be here if he took better care of himself. This was not some hereditary thing, nothing that he inherited from his father, grandfather or great grandfather. But rather, a slow suicide. While I have moved past the anger and frustration, I am left wondering what life would be like, right now, if he had taken a little better care of himself. If he stopped with the snacks, and went for walks instead. 

I love him dearly, but I cannot move past the notion that he did this to himself. There was no warning like with cancer, no long drawn out death with disease. Just a quick, blindsiding death, due to something that no one picked up on months ago when intervention would have counted for something. For most of us, being fat is because we don’t walk, eat like garbage and wonder why we feel like shit. And the bitter truth is, that food, has become that morning cigarette, or afternoon nip of whiskey for others. The fries from a fast food joint have become that smoke that others sneak on the job. 

That extra serving of ice cream, becomes the extra bottle of beer for others. Overeating and poor diet is a slow suicide in the long run. We accept it to a degree, due to our society being so decadent, so focused on “acceptance” and “tolerance”. So for those kicking the can around, or trying to justify the whole “body positivity” mutation that’s used as an excuse to be fat, understand that you are turning yourself into a ticking time bomb. That eventually, the poor habits, the excuses, the snacking, the binging, the buffets, all of it will eventually catch up. And what will be left, will be scared, sad, angry and confused children, widows, friends and family that know that this could have been stopped. 

That an apple instead of a candy bar could have changed things. That going for a walk, parking at the back of the parking lot, or just having a small instead of a large, could have changed things in enough time. I know we live in a world, with arbitrary beauty standards. A never-ending cacophony of voices that pull, prod and poke everyone in different directions when it comes to our bodies. But at the very end of the day, less a medical condition, calories in vs calories out and basic nutrition should be more important than anything. It’s okay to be fat, until it kills you suddenly, and your family is left to pick up the pieces. 

Please take care of yourselves.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the kind words, this hasn't been easy to say the least. As far as the gastric bypass surgeries, or stomach stapling, both of my parents had issues. Both, largely refused in some ways to deal with them. My mother has never actually confronted any of hers. And I doubt she will ever change, especially now. Its basically a waiting game of when she is going to die. She still cant eat much due to her stomach size, but that's a matter of time before it stretched back out to what it was.

As far as showing her this, it wouldn't help at all. Despite my being at 300lbs at one point, she claims I dont understand. But that's all a story for another sub and another time. As far as the struggle with weight. I get it. I just want those to know, who are on the fence, that this is the real consequence at the end of it.

fatpeoplestories,"my mom just got back from getting a dozen donuts from our nearby krispy kreme where she got more than she bargained for. she stood in a longish line and as she was about to order, an argument broke out between a customer and an employee. she described the customer as being “grossly overweight” (shocking since my mom is usually the sweetest person ever) and “incredibly entitled”. 
krispy kreme regularly sends out coupons to customers electronically over e-mail and many people including my mom, use them for to score sweet deals on donuts. this customer (let’s call her donut hoarder), wasn’t aware of this and was angered because her order of four dozen donuts cost substantially more than previous customers’ orders of one or two dozens which were discounted. naturally, donut hoarder begins to yell at the worker who must have been having a bad day because things went south quicker than an 80s coke dealer.
the two get into a screaming match while my mom is simply waiting to order so she can get home and have a nice sunday breakfast with her family. however, my mom hears a major bombshell from the worker.

worker: “people like you are the reason why this motherfucker is getting shut down tonight! this bitch is closing at 10 for good!”

donut hoarder: “good! no one likes your shitty ass donuts anyway!” not to be that person, but you wanted to buy 48 of those donuts.

fatpeoplestories,"This was back when our department had opened due to expansion three months ago when a group of colleagues went to eat out at a buffet/steakhouse to celebrate.  TL;DR at the bottom

(I know you are expecting Heffalump to be fired RN, but the processing and notifying will take a bit longer than you'd all expect, so please be patient)

 At the night of the floor opening after the cubicles, carpet, etc. had been laid out, a circle of colleagues started discreetly spreading invitations around to people they knew to eat out at a steakhouse down the street. I was invited as well, and for some reason, the word got around to Heffalump. I didn't know how, since no one was blabbing about it, but she heard somehow, and she was hungry.  Instead of keeping out of it, she started asking random people, ""Can I come, too?""  

It wasn't her place to ask, and I certainly would want to go as well if I was in her shoes, but it's just common sense to keep quiet if you weren't invited to something. She was asking many people if she could go, making things awkward for us AND for the other people who weren't invited.  So, in order to not make tensions at work, the offer was extended to everybody. A few more took up the offer, but others went home instead to rest, or something or other.  Now, before we went down, we agreed on who was paying for what, and the arrangements went something like this; you formed a group and split the bill or paid for your own food.  I went with a group to split the bill, and I saw Heffalump trying to join a group, but she was too late and everyone had formed groups already, so she had to pay for her own food. No problem here, but this is important for later. 

  
At the steakhouse/buffet, everyone was divided into two long tables, paid for the 'buffet entry (???)' and started to order steaks. Other dishes were in the buffet section, but you had to pay for the meat dishes. After paying, I kid you not, Heffalump straightaway picked up a plate and started piling food onto it. *No*, she did not take a seat or put her handbag and jacket down, she just grabbed food.   
Everyone just took a glance at her and was like, "".......""  
Either she was starving or *WHAT*, but three hours earlier I distinctly remember she had this massive bento box, so that's one option ruled out. My colleagues started to ignore her behaviour and began chatting away. So, in like seven or so minutes just as everyone was going to the buffet section, she *LITERALLY* just came back with TWO plates of food piled to high heaven. It is a TALENT of hers to dump so much food on plates in that amount of time. Trust me, it can be done if you saw her. 

When I was getting some food, I took a glance back at her and she was just *ENGULFING* her food. Like in [agar.io](https://agar.io), if you all know that game.  I was exchanging looks with some of my friends. 

When everyone was seated down, she had finished one plate. By the time some of the steaks were finished, she was eyeing them hungrily. One of the plates, *unfortunately*, was set down beside her. 

And this is what TRIGGERS me (for some reason, it still does to this day). She takes one steak with her fork and one hand and starts to eat it (I was expecting her to bite down into it, but hey, I can be wrong sometimes), eagerly cutting into it with her knife. Someone beside her (who was part of a group splitting the bill), noticed her, and frowned, secretly motioning to the others, ""WHAT. THE. HECK. ISN'T THIS OUR PLATE?"" 

And so he takes the plate away and sets in down on his other side. Seeing this, she starts to protest (with her mouth open), but he quickly says, ""Order off the menu if you want something. If I remember correctly, you're paying for your own food, in case you forgot."" 

Heffalump did not forget. She was most likely trying to get some free stuff, especially since she took a few pieces of garlic bread from someone's plate. The garlic bread was moved away soon after. Generally, everyone in our office has a 'didn't pay, won't eat' attitude unless on the rare occasion that someone is treating them out, and they don't like it when someone leeches off someone. 

She ordered a steak for herself (finally), as well as two thick-shakes, and a dessert plate, the contents of which I can't exactly remember. She burped loudly many times into her napkin without saying 'excuse me' and there was food flying onto the tablecloth and her top. 

And so at the end of the night, we split the bill, paid, and started to leave. Heffalump was walking considerably slow, and I think I heard someone asked her, ""Are you alright? Need some assistance?""

Heffalump declined and so everyone started walking ahead of her, eventually leaving her behind. Everyone offers help out of necessity if they think she needs it, but she always declines and tells us to go ahead (This was in a good part of town, and there were good lighting, a few officers, and people around, so this was totally fine) 

Just as I got out of the underground parking, I saw her taking a breather outside the main office. Understandable. 

The main thing I wanted to discuss (or rant, idk) was her apparent lack of manners in eating and in paying etiquette. Thank goodness she'll be fired soon so that my memories of her won't be all that I associate with my workplace. 

TL;DR At steak-house, Heffalump invites herself, goes straight for the buffet without taking a seat first, tries to get food off other's serving plates, has bad manners.","Heffalump side story, Steakhouse"

fatpeoplestories,"Hey, first time posting here. Woo! So, for frame of reference, I'm a 24 year old girl, 5'5, and about 130 pounds. I work out 6 days a week on average, so I've got some decent muscle mass. So today I'm at a well known pet supply store getting food for our two doggos. I grabbed the biggest bag of food they had, which is 35 pounds. Now, it doesn't weigh much and I'm easily able to carry it on my hip with one arm, and I've got my phone/wallet/keys in my right hand. While it may be light weight, I'm a small girl so the bag is fairly unwieldy. I walk up to the check out line and there are two hams in moomoos in front of me, both of which are using walking canes despite not looking over 40. They're both staring at me, and one of them says, ""there's nothing on the conveyor belt. Why don't you just put the bag on here?"" I don't feel like explaining that, due to the bag being large and me being small, it would be more effort and trouble to deal with shifting the bag onto the belt and then wrestling it back up after I pay. It's easier to just hold the damn thing, and easier for the cashier because then she doesn't have to deal with shifting the bag around on the too-small conveyor belt. Clearly I'm in no distress, I'm casually holding this bag of food while fiddling with my keys in my other hand, no issues at all. So I reply, ""Nah, I'm alright. It doesn't weigh much."" Ham then says, ""I don't know HOW you're holding that. I'd throw my back out!"" I fake a laugh just to get them to shut up so they'll hurry (as much as they're able) and waddle off so I can pay for my stupid dog food and get out of there.

fatpeoplestories,"You guy's just ate up my previous post (almost as fast as Kay will eat in this story) so here's another story.

So I grew up in a small town where all the churches in the town had one youth group and the youth pastor Kay (visualize a 5'2 women who weighs about 400 lbs) would hope from each of the churches every Sunday. 

So this Sunday she was at my church, after the service we always had coffee and snacks. An elderly lady in the church (who was well known for her superb baking skills) brought a tray full of brownies for everyone. 

The moment the service ends Kay heads straight for the snack table, and is just standing there staring at the brownies. The serene wrap and lids still on all the plates/containers of food (most people waited until the people who brought stuff would come by take the lids and serene wrap off before they helped themselves).

The lady who brought the brownies saw her standing there drooling at them and awkwardly came by and took the seren wrap off without even looking in Kay's direction. By this time I had walked over to grab a coffee and i look up to see Kay shoving an entire brownie into her mouth (they were cut up into squares about the length of my pinky finger) without even biting it, once she finished chewing she reached for another and did the exact same. 

I just stared at her wide eyed because these brownies were SUPER rich like most people could only have one of them, and here she is shoveling them into her mouth like she hasn't eaten in days. I didn't even know what to do, other people were looking at her but were trying to not stare. After like 5 or 6 of them she finally stopped (there was only like maybe a little over a dozen on the tray) and she then grabbed some cookies and walked away to eat them. 

I literally felt sick after what I had seen, I went to tell my Dad (he was the pastor) and when he looked over to where she was she was back at the table grabbing more brownies!! I guess later he ended up talking to her that those snacks are for everyone and that she can't just eat as much as she wants. 

Stay tuned, i might post next about when she told the girls our youth about her sex life (or lack their of), and how she taught me the true meaning of homophobia",The Behemothic youth pastor and the after church brownies

After a few minutes in the thick of the chaos he gives up and goes towards the back of the parking lot. Cue screeching wail from Pudgypaula. 

""Park closer!! I want to take as few steps as possible!!"" 

I shit you not people. The silence hung in the car for a few seconds as my husband and I tried not to look at each other in fear of bursting out in laughter. 

My FIL found a closer spot eventually. 

To this day when my husband and I pull into a parking lot that is busy one of us lets out a screechy wail of ""I want to take as few steps as possible"". Then burst into a fit of chuckles.","My MIL, pudgypaula"
fatpeoplestories,"I've recently moved back into my parents house temporarily after a relationship breakup. My sister, who lives in a city a few hundred miles away, made the trip to visit us with her two kids. My sister is lovely, as are both her kids. we had a great time, going to castles, walking around parks etc

&amp;#x200B;

The final night saw us in our parents house, with me preparing fish and chips and mushy peas. My brother was also planning on attending. My older brother, who unfortunately has had a hard time of late (a different story), has a lot of fatlogic. He is so large his bulk means he walks like a body builder, but it's all fat. He says he needs to eat lots because he has a physical job (he does, but no one needs portions like he has them). He has recently had to pass on his old t shirts because he can no longer fit in them, which caused him some difficulty as some of them have memories attached to them.

&amp;#x200B;

anyway. he walks through the door, only half an hour late. the first thing he asks is 'where is the food'. no hello to the sister or neice/nephew that he hasn't seen in several months, our parents or me, but concentrating on the food. then he says 'i wasn't sure if you were feeding us, so i brought a pizza'. er...what?

&amp;#x200B;

he sees my dad making a gin and tonic and says 'i'll have one', to which my dad gave him a look and responded 'no you're driving!', so he settled with a glass of coke. he sits down, and catches up with everyone. i'm standing apart, because a) i'm still sorting dinner out and b) the way he has come in has not sit well with me and i'm watching him closely.

&amp;#x200B;

So he asks about the past few days, where we've gone to and what was done. When he heard that they they went to a pub for lunch, his demeanor got really intent and he was asking 'what did you have for lunch', as if that is the most important thing. he was dissapointed in the response, as most of them had the vegetarian curry. he seems to view vegetables with a mild disdain. The converstation then went on to the next day, where he said he'd drop off his kids at my parents while he went to the dentist.

&amp;#x200B;

""what time are they coming? do we need to feed them breakfast?""

""i'll drop them off at half 8. yes, i don't feed them breakfast because it's so expensive.""

&amp;#x200B;

record scratch. what? you're relying on our retired 75/78 year old parents to feed YOUR kids because it's too expensive for you? jesus fuck, how selfish is that?

&amp;#x200B;

anyway, on to the main event. my brother gets angry at really ridiculous things sometimes. he started off talking about his work. he has a coworker who is big into cycling. He cycles everywhere and he does 'intermittent fasting'. at this point he goes into a big rant on how ridiculous intermittent fasting is and how dangerous it is, and how this coworker comes into the lunch room while fasting and says 'if he is fasting, he should go somewhere else. he shouldn't be coming into the lunch room when there are other people eating'. this is when i chime in

&amp;#x200B;

""so he comes into the lunch room while fasting and complains about other people eating?""

&amp;#x200B;

my brother is still ranting, and ignores the question. so i ask it again. he ignores it again. i grab his attention, and ask him again.

&amp;#x200B;

""uh. i dunno, he's always comatose when he comes in"". then he goes back to ranting.

&amp;#x200B;

so this bloke is doing something that does not affect my brother. he does not crow about it. he does not lecture people about it. he does not complain while other people are eating around him. the only way my brother knows about it is because another co-worker was asking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

this rant lasted about 15 minutes. it also briefly covered muslim fasting (as i used to work with a muslim lady), and he said that we should invade when they are fasting. that topic was nipped in the bud when i mentioned that warriors had immunity from ramadan, and also asked why we would invade them now? is it because they are muslim? do you not like muslims?

&amp;#x200B;

when it came time to serve up dinner, he looked dissapointed at the portion size (i.e a normal) but was wise enough not to say anything.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: in normal circumstances my brother does feed his kids breakfast. in the context of this story, the point was he doesnt feed them breakfast when our parents look after them. basically he's pushing the cost of breakfast onto my parents. so calm down, people.","My brother, fatlogic and his rant against fasting (contains mild racism and entitlement)"
fatpeoplestories,"This is an important update to my previous Heffalump story, found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/bty0qf/another_disabled_toilet_story/). No, she hasn't been sacked yet, but there's another issue.TL;DR at the bottom.I'll update you on the previous story first.

The superior going undercover is doing the same job as us for the meantime (he's done it for a while before his promotion), and he sits like, 5 rows behind from Heffalump. The rows of cubicles he sits in are raised from the floor a bit, so he's in a perfect position to monitor Heffalump. He is in my line of sight, and whenever he looks displeased, I know he's watching Heffalump without having to look around. Whenever she opens a snack or something, he rubs his temples or sighs a bit, and he is most likely anticipating firing her.  And so I sent him a work email that said something like, ""Take 1 shot every time she opens a snack, watches a video, or doesn't pick up another file."" He was amused, but the sound of another candy wrapper (hoo hoo, guess who) brought back his anxiety.

As for the other matter, it appears she has been the cause of the troubles from the snack and candy shop on our floor, which started 2 weeks ago. How she managed to have the guts to do it, IDEK, but her argument reveals something that she thought it was free. Apparently, while exploring the kitchen on the first day of the shop's opening, she saw someone getting from the snack and candy bar, and she thought it was free. Heffalump asked the person if it was, and the person just said a rushed, very mildly sarcastic 'maybe yes,' because there was SHOP on the sign, obviously implying financial transaction. And there was a price list on the far side of the shop, but she probably didn't bother walking there.

And so when the money was counted against the amount of the initial goods, there was a great discrepancy between the two records. They looked through the security cameras, found out it was her, and now she has to cough up $110 worth of lollies and snacks. It's not that she had soooo much food (she had her usual 1-2 packs, which is still a lot), she just took the pricier ones, because she *thought* they were free. There wasn't a problem in security. You scan your employee card at the snack bar to enter and then get whatever your heart desires (to the degree of the candy availability in the shop), scan it, and pay it later downstairs at the main desk or wherever. If you haven't paid anything in a month, it'll be automatically be deducted from your salary.

The first month of the candy shop was a trial run (without company loss, weird for a trial I know), to see if the shop would work. In the trial month, however, you are required to pay the amount within a certain timeframe. I'm guessing it was two weeks. She was not totally oblivious to the fact that you have to pay, she was there when I said something to my colleague like, ""I can't find these anywhere, although they COST me a bit much, the satisfaction of my craving is greater than FINANCIAL SACRIFICE."" (cringey I know)Sorry if this was a bit lame. I'll hear from superior tomorrow about what'll happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I don't know how people like her exist. 

TL;DR Heffalump takes food from candy and snack bar thinking they're free, ends up with $110 owings after two weeks.",Heffalump 2
fatpeoplestories,"Warning; this is very much a rant 

So growing up i went to youth group, one of my youth pastors lets call her Kay weighed probably around 400 lbs, 5'2 This women literally looked like a  bowling ball with four sticks coming out. She only really caried her weight on her torso and her arms and legs looked oddly thin. 

Anyways kay was notorious for always saying the absolute worst things ever. She once did a sermon on how the reason Africa was poor was because the people had not listened to God and they needed to ""go forth and multiply"", honey there's literally 1 billion africans. She also would tell couples in the youth that they weren't allowed to hold hands or anything because it makes her jealous (she was like 45 and single) more that i think about it she might actually be a pedophile if she would get jealous of 14-15 year old couples... she would regularly tell people that they were sinning and if they didn't change they were heading straight for hell, yet i literally have seen her down an entire box of donuts with no shame in who saw her (bible says gluttony is a sin too). She was literally the epitome of a hypocrite.

Kay would regularly complain about her weight and whenever i would suggest exercise like she would rant about how it never works. One time i asked her why she thinks that and she responded with saying that she jumps on a mini trampoline and she hasn't seen results, i was just like ok. not really exercise but ok. 

Anyways i have a couple stories of her either hamming out after church or youth group, and of her saying/doing the creepiest crap ever if you guys want to hear more.",Obese/rascist youth pastor

&amp;#x200B;

Myself, KingOfTheSouth, and TheGoodDoctor were all going together on a week-long training at one of our company's other sites a few states over, about 2 months after the 1st story (yeah, they're out-of-order, but I saved the worst for last). The classroom training wasn't all that interesting, but we were going to see the operational work we supported for once (this would be the first time we'd actually see it in action).

&amp;#x200B;

Myself, TheGoodDoctor, and KingOfTheSouth all arrived separately at the airport. KingOfTheSouth had deliberately brought an oversized bag, refused to check it, and waited until the gate attendants asked for people to ""volunteer"" to check their bags to check it. In his logic, this was brilliant because it saved him the $15 or whatever (nevermind that the company covers airfare and fees!). He was so proud of himself too, like there aren't a million other shitheads who had the same idea!

&amp;#x200B;

After our first flight, we had a layover before our connecting flight to the tiny regional airport near the site. While we were waiting, KingOfTheSouth realized he had..... forgotten all his access paperwork. As in, literally the only thing he needed to bring, and now we'd all have to wait for him to get temporary papers when we showed up on the first day of training. He tried calling our manager and one of our coworkers for help and they just burst out laughing-apart from KingOfTheSouth being a complete idiot, did he really think they could mail it to our hotel overnight?! Or that they were going to break into his apartment so they could fax it to him?! His response when we called him out was to play the victim and basically say ""nothing I can do about it now, so stop yelling at me!"" We're just lucky this didn't happen on the supplier tour since they're an independent company. Hell, he's lucky the guards at the checkpoint on this trip were as understanding as they were.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, so bad. But don't worry, it gets worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Training was mostly lectures and guided/escorted tours, so the only thing worth noting is that he outright refused to do any of the assigned work or reading because he ""already knew it"". One day, training got out early, so I suggested we head over to a fascinating (and free) museum operated by the site providing the training.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I think we could head over and check out the museum today, it's nice out and we're not going to get the chance to see it again.

&amp;#x200B;

TheGoodDoctor: Cool, let's do it

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: No, I don't want to.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Come on, it'll be interesting and we might never be in this area again!

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: No, I don't want to. I'm only hear for the training and feasting (his word; due to a thick accent he pronounced it as ""fisting"". I may or may not have giggled internally everytime he said this word-no I'm not ashamed).

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Seriously?

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, KingOfTheSouth wasn't a complete shit and got a ride back with somebody else rather than force myself and TheGoodDoctor not to go. That may be the only half-decent thing he's ever done in the time I've known him.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, back to KotS' horrible antics.

&amp;#x200B;

One night, we decided to get dinner at a barbecue place. TheGoodDoctor and KingOfTheSouth got into a conversation about good vs. bad calories, how they ""don't count"" if it's healthy, all that shit. I feel kind of left out, but whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

The portions there were massive, and I was done after eating \~half of my meal. I don't like microwaving shit, so I just offered it to whoever wanted it. TheGoodDoctor couldn't finish his meal either, and also declared it up for grabs. KingOfTheSouth finished off his meal.... and mine.... and took TheGoodDoctor's for a midnight snack. According to him, he doesn't believe in eating unless it's a ""feast"", which somehow made it OK to eat for 2 and bring home a whole 3rd meal. And he wonders why he's like twice my fucking weight (and I'm not exactly skinny myself).

&amp;#x200B;

The training was in the literal middle of nowhere (maybe 80 miles/130 km from the nearest town) so myself, TheGoodDoctor, and KingOfTheSouth had long and not always pleasant conversations on the drive to/from the training site each day. Some things I learned about KingOfTheSouth:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Failed ESL (twice) and proud of it

\* Flunked out of grad school and had to go to a different school where he got in as a legacy

\* Gets paid under the table by his father, including covering his ridiculous spending habits (remember, this guy is 28 and makes more than me!)

\* Considers soccer a contact sport, and views deliberately hurting the other players as winning (I swear I am not making this up)

\* In a discussion of politics, claimed that Donald Trump is a serial liar and that's why he trusts him

\* During a discussion of somebody else at our work (different part of the company but he supports us indirectly), his first and only question was ""wait, is he Jewish?"" I know, not a horrible question, but his tone/how quickly he asked it made it pretty clear KotS was an anti-Semite.

\* One of the training days was on the Summer Solstice (June 21). When TheGoodDoctor made an offhand comment about how it was the longest day of the year, KotS scoffed and said ""yeah, sure"".

&amp;#x200B;

([THIS IS WHAT KOTS ACTUALLY BELIEVES](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d3/Screen_grab_of_the_Time_Cube_website.png)).

&amp;#x200B;

I'd gone on vacation the previous month. KotS had agreed to handle the airline, rental car, and hotel through HR, and had booked them all while I was away. Before you say ""well that's decent of him"", it gets ugly FAST. He:

\* Put the hotel under my name only (i.e. I would be 100% liable for any damage he caused).

\* Put the car under my name only (see above, plus he insisted I put his name on the lease so that he could drive if he felt like it).

\* Booked the car, hotel, AND airfare for the wrong fucking days! When management discovered what had happened, he threw me under the bus and said I'd given him the wrong dates and it was my fault. Since I was like 500 miles away at the time, obviously I was in no position to defend myself.

\* The sick fuck LAUGHED as he recounted what he'd done and how angry management had been at what happened. I was fucking speechless at this point, and wound up going to HR about it when we got back (they did nothing despite incontrovertible evidence and independent witness testimony because, hey, accountability is un-American).

\* He still doesn't understand why what he did was wrong, or why I might be angry at what he did. Coming soon to a /r/TalesOfMike submission near you.

&amp;#x200B;

After this, I barely spoke to him. Even today I wouldn't spit on him if he were on fire because of this shit. He even acted all hurt that I'd gotten mad at him!

&amp;#x200B;

The downside of not speaking to an irredeemable waste of skin like KingOfTheSouth is that I don't have anything else worth including to round out the story, and the rest of the training &amp; flights home were uneventful. Like I mentioned in the first story, at the time KingOfTheSouth and I lived in the same apartment complex . Even after all the shit he'd done over the previous week, he had the fucking nerve when we got off the plane to ask if he could bum a ride with me back there. Being absolutely sick of him, I refused (though I didn't have the guts to tell him that it was because he is infectious human waste).

fatpeoplestories,"Caution; this post is lengthy I was reading through this sub, read a few disabled toilet stories, and remembered something in my office that happened 2 weeks ago.  I have this 28 yr old office mate whose cubicle is a few rows down. She is 350-400 lbs (I'm bad at eye estimates), and 5'4. Walking across our whole floor (iT's NoT eVeN tHaT fArRrRrR) has her huffing and puffing to blow your friggin' house down, you can just tell she doesn't shower every day. She tries to hide the smell with Lancome (a perfume brand). Honestly, it's wasted on her. 

 (I'm not dissing fat people in general or anything, just those spouting unreasonable fatlogic and whatnot. There are a few people on my floor about the same BMI as her, but they're polite, respectful, and do their jobs) 

 Every 1-2 hours you can hear the sound of snack bags and wrappers being opened, followed by crunches (mouth crunches, not exercise crunches). ""Chewing something helps my concentration,"" she says. The people on our floor are quite productive, given our jobs (which are all the same on our floor, but I can't disclose further), but she (we haven't named her yet? Let's try Heffalump) is so lazy. 

Basically, the job goes like this. 'Something' comes in, you deal with it. If you face a roadblock, you send it to another person on another floor who can deal with the appropriate section. The 'something' then gets updated and sent back to you (which takes an hour at least, and you get on with your job.  During that hour, you should be starting a new case or file. But Heffalump would just open a bag of snacks or whatever and actually EFFING WAIT for OVER AN HOUR for the case to be sent back to her. After sending the case to someone else, she'd watch youtube or scroll through or phone or something, IDK, I'm too busy being productive actually to find out, but every one near her knows she is slacking off. 

Our supervisor (Shelly, not her name IRL) has confronted her about this, but Shelly is retiring soon and is too kind to tell her off seriously. We are paid according to hours/quota mix (can't say more, sorry), so it motivates the workers to work more, and also for fairness in a way. But not Heffalump, she ain't motivated.  

Everyone's average quota for the day can reach 100+, sometimes 200+, provided you don't slack off. Heffalump's quota, I KID YOU NOT, never reaches over 50. 47 is her 'highest score.'  Anyways, about the disabled toilet... It so happens to be situated across the whole floor from Heffalump's cubicle, right before the women's, and so that's the one she usually uses. Because, as per her words, she's too tired to walk to the women's (3 feet away from the disabled toilet). Honestly, the other chubby people in our department take the elevator to other floors to visit some friends during break. (For those who'd say Heffalump might have a condition or something, her medical records indicate nothing, checkup after checkup shows she is just LAZY).  

A colleague of mine had a leg injury recently and needs a crutch to get around. He's 60-something, let's name him John. He's really funny and is a great guy. He can get on with work, but he does less for the time being in order not to be stressed. He had been advised, no, URGED to stay at home until his leg healed, but he hates doing nothing at home, so he comes to work. Everyone's sick and tired of arguing (no yelling, just intense conversation) and telling him to stay home and rest, so we just try and be considerate of him at work, like getting him a hot pack, a meal from the next floor, etc. 

 And so it's kind of unspoken law that the disabled toilet is his. Just as John was going there one day, Heffalump wobbles at a speed she has never wobbled for the entire time I knew her, toward the disabled toilet because she's busting. They are both standing outside the door, competing to get in. Heffalump tries to squeeze her way in, much to John's annoyance, and so he nudges her with a crutch and sternly says, ""OI,"" gathering a few people's attention. 

John is rarely angry. He's a usually cheerful guy, and when he's upset, he is UPSET. Heffalump is in shock and disappointedly goes to the women's bathroom. Shelly, our supervisor, knows that John has priority over Heffalump, and leaves it to be since nothing else needed resolving. 

John looked pretty satisfied with himself when he returned, and Heffalump let him use it before she did. Her quota is still the same though. Honestly, it's a waste of the cubicle; someone more productive could have been on our floor and she makes our department stats look bad, because the higher-ups will think it's the supervisors' fault. 

Well, guess what? A superior has taken into account Shelly's complaint of Heffalump, and is going undercover for a day or two, two days from now to see her performance to see whether or not there are grounds to fire her on (just to consider both sides of the argument). No one else knows this but me and Shelly (and FYI I am allowed to post this, provided I protect people's identities so THERE YA GO, and it wasn't confidential company stuff, but we're not telling anyone else anyway), and we are just awaiting the day of our salvation.

fatpeoplestories,"We had a guy in our Uni class who required a teaching assistant/scribe for our classes. This is fairly common but there was nothing common about the assistant herself, Elaine.








For 3 years this lady was in all of my classes, as she should have been, that's her job. What isn't her job however is disrupting the classes with her own unrelated quips, questions or fucking opinions. 






My dislike for Elaine was sparked by her incessant need to interrupt any and every class. What started as dislike grew to hatred over three long years. 







Elaine is approx 5 ft 3 and a UK size 26. Almost as round as she was tall. It became apparent that she was diabetic and had such bad knees she had to walk with a crutch or walking stick.







 Elaine was only 40. If you were behind Elaine in a corridor, you were going to be late for class if you couldn't reroute in time. She would relentlessly and unashamedly flirt with any of our male lecturers and was suspiciously quiet with female ones compared to the normal rate of interruptions. 






Which included eating constantly. It wasn't allowed, signs in every lecture theatre saying no food or drink. Our lecturers were lenient and she took full advantage of this. Where we would ""sneak"" in a bottle of water or a sandwich.  Elaine snuck in a share size bag of crisps and devoured them. I think I still have a recording somewhere of a lecture where you can actually here her crunching away, I'll try and find it and edit in later. 







A personal thing that didn't seem to bother everyone as much was the fact that she always wore flip flops and her cracked feet, gouging cuts and lack of toenails actually gave me the boak.








She would crack jokes with the male lecturers and then when none of us laughed along, would continue flirting with them along the lines of ""oh all these young things, they know nothing, I bet it's nice for you to speak to an adult professional like me sometimes! Tee hee!"". 








Just building the back story of the 3 year detriment to my education. The last straw was in the 3rd year when a classmate of mine went to enter the disabled toilet on the bottom floor while we waited for class to start. 







He had injured his back at work over the weekend and subsequently it was agony for him to walk on an uneven surface, stairs were out of the question. 









He emailed the school office beforehand to ensure there would be no issue in him using the disabled facilities on campus until his injury healed - he didn't want to be disrespectful to chronically disabled people but also didn't want to have to miss classes if he didn't have to. 







Enter Elaine literally like a fucking wrecking ball. Her panting could be heard across the hall as she geared up to chastise Ben. 








"" Ehm excuse me, that toilet is for disabled like me only, you're a fit young thing so don't be so disrespectful and go use the male toilets on the first floor, now off you go like a good boy!"" she smiled and yanked the door open and the handle out of his hand and entered the toilet. 








Ben didn't have the heart or balls to say anything and the day continued as normal with Elaine and her smug fat face walking around proud of her victory. 









I never saw her after 3rd year but did find out recently she had to retire under medical grounds as she wasn't fit to walk the span of the campus anymore.








 At 43 this lady got to retire on the government's (tax payer's) dime and with a nice healthy pension from the uni because she couldn't walk a half mile without having to rest for 30 minutes before commencing work again. I still hate Elaine.",The Guardian of Disabled Toilets.

Disclaimer: yes I'm an asshole, I've always been an asshole, you dont need to point it out. If anything below hurts anyone's feelings I'm sorry in advanced. However I'm avoiding spoilers up here so just read the damn thing.

So anyone who knows me well, or has read my previous posts on other subreddits. Knows I have a favorite bar I go to. Everybody has one of those... right?

This tale takes place a few moons ago, and even more drinks ago.

The setting: Friday night at the bar, some girl is having a birthday bash with all of her friends. I'd introduce all of the characters, but again spoilers.

Typical Friday night, me at the bar... alone because my bros all dipped for one reason or another. (Mostly family stuff don't blame them)

I'm two or three drinks in when the party bus rolls up. &gt;for you youngins, that means for the next hour or so the bar gets crazy with whatever gaggle of drunks celebrating whatever - typically weddings or birthdays.

Cue the birthday girl waltzing in like shes about to own the place. The reason I know its the birthday girl is because she has a sash that tells me so.

I mind my own business like a decent human and order another drink when I feel a presence pushing up against me. It's the birthday girl in all 200 to 250lbs of glory. Eyeing me like the last donut in the case. She will be BG for obvious reasons.

BG: Hey, handsome, are these seats taken? (Like 5 more down the bar from me)

Me: (being friendly) No, they aren't.

I wish her a happy birthday-because sash, and have some conversation with her and her friends. They ask what I do (i run a service truck for the local tire shop and I farm with my dad) if I'm single (I am, I use the 'haven't found anyone who wants to put up with me' line) semi start flirting with one of her friends - who started it btw.

I can tell BG is getting a touch jealous and gets up to go to the bathroom on her phone.

A wild EM appears! Shes kinda trashed.

EM: you should buy BG a drink... it is her birthday after all.

Side bar, this is after probably 20 minutes of all the girls trying to weasel free drinks out of me... but I usually don't buy girls drinks at the bar, I go in with x amount of dollars and don't go over that.

Me: Ma'am, I don't buy other people drinks, I'm on a budget.

This cycle continues until BG is back from the bathroom. I'm getting less and less polite each time I have to say no.

EM: well give her your number then.

Me: if I don't want to buy her a drink, why would I give her my number

EM: it's her birthday (long and condescending on the birthday)

Me: so what... I said no.

I'm starting to get heated at this point... the Scots/German temper is flaring. My bartender has seen this before and knows I'm almost to the point of the nuclear option - nuclear option tends to hurt fee fees.

fatpeoplestories,"It's been about 10 years or so, so I feel this is safe to share. This is my first ham story, so please be kind.

  
I started working for the state prison system right out of high school and am now in my mid-30s. I have seen a lot of hams come and go, but this one stands out to me. The state has since added physical fitness standards, but the ""test"" is a total joke.

I had been at this all-female prison for a couple of years when Officer Herniadon came in fresh from the academy. 

It was a lovely Texas summer and I smelled her before I saw her. The stench was something between bologna and unwashed vagina. Picture Jabba the Hutt with short dark hair in an officer uniform.

I was working in a ""picket"" that day, which is the control room from which we monitor activity and control doors. Officer Herniadon was sent into my ""picket"" with me to learn how to control the doors and such. Which meant that I would be trapped with that smell for the remainder of my shift.  Great.

Once the area was clear, I unlocked the door and allowed her in my control room. I began showing her the various buttons and switched and what they did. Officer Herniadon was only interested in sitting down in a chair and cooling off. 

I figured that was fine as it was a very hot day so I gave her a few minutes. At that time, they began running chow in my area, so my attention was focused on monitoring the flow of traffic and doors.

I heard shuffling behind me inside the picket, so I turned around to see what Officer Herniadon was doing. 

Officer Herniadon then announced, ""These are stale."" while spraying food and crumbs out of her mouth. The bitch had gotten into my lunch! 

I calmly took my lunch bag out of her hands, trying to salvage the rest of my lunch. She had only gotten into my strawberry wafer cookies, which were not stale. They probably weren't as sweet as she was accustomed to. 

Thankfully, Officer Herniadon and her smell were taken to another area for other training. 

She did not last long on our shift. We had to answer a few ""officer down"" calls where her ""shugahs"" had gotten too low from walking a few feet. She would make a scene and be laid out on the concrete when we got there. I would find her a soda or some candy before I responded because I knew that was the reason for her performance. 

I had to go and cover for her doing certain jobs that her bad knees, bad back, etc would not allow. We were roughly the same age, btw. 

Finally, admin ""promoted"" her to the kitchen where all she had to do was sit behind a desk and check out a few tools. The inmates did all the physical work. She began calling herself Sergeant Herniadon and bragged to everyone that would listen. We were too happy to have her off shift to bother calling her out on her unofficial promotion.

She would make ""jokes"" asking if anyone wanted to buy drugs. Apparently, she wasn't joking because she was arrested a couple of months later for selling drugs to an undercover officer in a school zone. Her tearstained mugshot made all the hammy annoyance worth it. She was fired from the prison due to the fact that she now had a record.

I was thinking about her the other day, so I stalked her Facebook page. Under the employment section of her page, she's ""retired"" and her last job was ""former sergeant"". 

Makes me a little sad that it's been so many years and that's all she has.",Prison Ham - Officer Herniadon
fatpeoplestories,"So I have a friend, we'll call her Meg.  We've been friends for years, since college, and she's always been quite large, but a few years ago things started to get bad.  Like 6x clothes were getting tight.  So, she had surgery.  Unfortunately where she got it, it was basically ""snip and go"".  No real follow up or anything.  That was 2 summers ago.  Fast forward to a few weeks ago.

She texts me asking if she can come over for supper.  I say sure, and inform her of the menu I was making.  It was roasted veg with a BBQ chicken breast and a salad.  She then replied with ""Well, I'll just bring my own stuff to eat.""

Alright, fine.

So she shows up and has a large (like the largest) slurpee in one hand, a bag from Dairy Queen in another, and a sundae in another.  She plops down on my couch and goes ""I just don't know how I ended up at Dairy Queen, I just drove and ended up there."" 

Proceeds to pull out a burger and fries and stares at me.  ""Do you want some?""

""Nope, I'm cool thanks.""

""Oh, okay.  I won't be able to eat all this.""

Starts to eat the burger.  It quickly disappears.  Then the fries.  Finishes most of the slurpee.  

Then the realization hits that her ice cream is melting.

Hoovers that thing in about 2 minutes and leans back and goes.  ""Man, my system hates me.""

About 20 minutes later thunders up my stairs to go to the bathroom.  I waited about 15 minutes before I called to see if she was okay.  ""Yeah, I have my period and it makes me shit myself...""

Soo....2000 calories in a meal AFTER bariatric surgery...I don't wonder how she's gained back about 3/4 of the weight.

fatpeoplestories,"I'm a female tech security engineer and relatively introverted, so I don't socialize much. But every once in awhile, I find someone I'm comfortable with and spend a lot of time with them.

One such person was a girl we will call Cat.

Cat and I worked together for a couple years and remained friends. She is about 5', and very overweight. She is also very cheap and has a couple of nasty side effects from this - one being that she would take all of the leftover food from every work party home with her (usually before the party was even over), and the second being that she continued to squeeze into her pre-gain pants and thought no one noticed that she couldn't zipper any of them.  

Regardless, we meshed well. My son loved her to death, I took her all over the mid Atlantic for free, and I even took care of her when she was sick.

None of that mattered in the end.

I didn't realize it then, but she was in love with the father of said child, my now-husband.

Having gained some weight myself during the pregnancy, and feeling pretty sick from insulin resistance, I jumped on board with keto and began fixing myself and my husband. He complained a lot about the diet, but secretly was grateful I was helping him feel better, even while making non-stop ""not as good as Taco Bell"" jokes... Which is always met with groans because no one else likes it (Taco Johns 4 life, foo).

Well... Over the next year, Cat got him alone a few times and each time told him how much she hates keto, how dumb it is, how I'm totally out of line to subject him to that, and said she was off to - where else - Taco Bell.

When he told me, it didn't take too long for me to stitch together the pieces, even though he was adorably oblivious and obviously didn't remember her refusing Taco Bell on several occasions.

We graciously invited her to the wedding, told her it would be catered keto.

She now hasn't spoken to me in almost a year.

fatpeoplestories,"During the final days of our friendship Hama pulled away more than ever before. I think she knew something was up. Absolutely everything came to a head one morning... over guitar hero.

Zedd, OM, and I were hanging out before our first class. The topic of older music came up and eventually we admitted to mostly knowing those songs because of guitar hero. Hama showed up, pulled up a chair and sat directly in front of us. We gave her a small greeting but went back to the conversation. Hama didn't greet us and just sat there staring. After maybe 30 seconds she put her headphones in. After another minute she stormed off. Zedd commented that if she wants to throw a fit she should try interacting with us first. 

We went back to our conversation and after a bit I checked the time on my phone. I noticed I had a message. Hama had left her bag and didn't want to come back and get it. She was telling me (not asking) me to bring it to the bathroom for her. I just so happened to need to use the restroom so I grabbed her bag and made it half way across the room when Hama STAMPEDED into the fucking room. I'm shocked I didn't feel her stomping from a distance. 

She went right up to me and I reached out to hand her the bag, didn't even get half way when she snatched it out of my hands. I felt bad because I was worried she'd gotten her period and I didn't get her stuff fast enough or something. Nope, she turns around, nearly hitting me with her rolls the way a bitch girl tries to hit you with her hair, then stomped off into the distance.

Zedd. Was. Pissed. She started ranting up a storm about how you should treat people and if she wanted to be a bitch she could be a bitch to someone her own size, ect. She really zeroed in on the fact Hama didn't say a word to us and was seemingly pissed off we didn't didn't chase after her.

About 2 hours later we met up again for lunch, Hama was no where to be seen. That's when it happened. OM opened up her facebook app to message Hama about where she was when she realized she didn't have her on facebook anymore. Hama had unfriended her. Zedd and I check and sure enough Hama had unfriended us too. She signed her own death warrant.

Zedd makes a call out post about people throwing tantrums then getting pissed off when you don't cater to them. OM went to the group chat to explain the situation. I was kind of in shock. After everything I had done for her, after all the abuse I took, and all the tearful calls I talked her through, after all the harrassment, after EVERYTHING that happened: she unfriended me because I didn't chase after her. I snapped and started laughing. This whole situation was hilarious to me because of how ridiculous it was. I was done.

The consensus of the group chat was for everyone to basically disown Hama. One friend wrote her a letter describing how Hama's behavior made her feel, another started writing her a novel of a text, some decided to just ignore her indefinitely, and OM took it upon herself to send a message from all of us to Hama. Basically saying 

""We've been nothing but kind and understanding to you. You will literally not even bother to say good morning then storm off. You've treated all of us badly but especially Mymass and [friend that Hama guilted for her diet]. I cannot believe I ever questioned Mymass after you'd talk shit about her. You're fucked up in the head. Get help.""

Hama responded ""I know I'm a bad friend and don't deserve friends. That's why I unfriended you guys.""
This was the same shit she always said. If you ever called her out it was ""boohoo I'm such a bad person. Why are you my friend."" Then no improvement. She never changed and you ended up making her feel better in the end. We all recognized what Hama was doing as manipulation and after a lot of calming down and me reminding OM that if Hama killed herself and she had sent her a mean message she could go to jail for that, OM responded something like,

""Yeah, you are a bad friend. I wish you'd have decided to be a better person than take the easy way out. Good luck in the future.""

The fallout lasted a few days, it included ever single person that we shared as friends cutting her off for her toxic behavior. She ended up dropping out and working at a factory that OM worked at to put herself (OM) through college. 

It seemed to be over as fast as it happened. We were all shellshocked and weren't quite sure about the future of the situation, but no one wanted to stay friends with Hama. No one even wanted to look at her.

Brief epilogue:

Because of course that couldn't be the end of it. The next day we decided to eat lunch in the middle of the cafeteria instead of the corner. We set out bags down and went to get food. When we got back Zedd's backpack was gone. A thing about Zedd is she  grew up in a rough situation, because of that she absolutely HATED when people touched her stuff. Even if it was her friend it would piss her off, and right now we're all desperately searching when we see Hama's lacky of a boyfriend carrying 2 backpacks across the room. Zedd ran. 

When she got to the table he basically held her bag hostage and said ""you're gonna eat lunch with my girlfriend."" She did, but didn't say a word. She never got forced to have lunch with Hama again.

About 2 months later her boyfriend came up and asked where Hama was. I told him I hadn't spoken to her in months and we weren't friends. He looked mad and stormed off saying ""no one tells me anything"". Like? We hadn't had lunch with her in 2 months except when you badically kidnapped one of us? Why is this a surprise to you?

I'd get news about her from time to time and might post one of those stories. But yeah, it's kind of fucked up how manipulative she tried to be up until the very end. You could almost hear the ""you're not supposed to respond that way. You're supposed to tell me everything I'm a great friend and that you're sorry for upsetting me."" In her replies.

Regardless of everything I hope she learned her lesson and became a better person.",Hama the Jealous Whale: Finale
fatpeoplestories,"For those of you who haven't seen my previous posts about Jeff and Amy, refer back to them for backstory:

Back in those glory days of 2015, I had my one friend over to Jeff and Amy's most nights, even when I was told that I couldn't have him over before dinner so that ""everybody can get a full square meal"" (translation: so that Amy could put all the food on the table around her in a rough semicircle and not have to worry about holding back).

One fine day when my friend \*was\* allowed over for dinner, we were chowing down on a Jeff special: boxed mashed potatoes with powder gravy, lunchmeat turkey slices, boxed stuffing, and canned cranberry sauce. Mind you, this was not Thanksgiving. Jeff was, and still is, a terrible cook, and Amy is even worse.

After arranging all the food about her like moons around a gas giant, Amy asked for someone to please pass the butter. My friend looked over to her and started giggling like an idiot, and that made Jeff more than a little annoyed. Before becoming antivax, the man was once scientifically-minded, so simply telling my friend that it was impolite to laugh at Amy for wanting butter was completely out of the question. Instead, this man decided to go on a spiel about how during times of ""economic hardship,"" (for the record, he first met Amy in '06 and became official with her in early '07, so before the housing crisis) fat women are apparently ""more attractive"" because their weight shows that they can ""take care of themselves.""

Hamplanet: Bridget (not her real name) about 400 lbs. 5 foot 6 inches

&amp;#x200B;

Bridget and I were still friends during the spring semester of my freshman year. Things were okay, she'd still have breakdowns every so often but the winter break allowed her to reset. We were actually doing *physical* activities together. We'd swim at the campus pool during open swim, we would go on walks, and we'd toss a softball around too. The friendship was in the best shape it ever was and ever will be.

Bridget wanted me to meet her family and her horses so I agreed and we took a trip to her house. The ride down was nice and had great views. Finally, we arrived at her house. The house and neighborhood were in a low-mid middle-class area which seemed pretty decent to me. My thoughts changed when we entered the house. There were things piled everywhere and *everything* was dirty.

They also had two dogs and two cats so there was animal hair everywhere too.

The kitchen was awful, there were dirty dishes, and the stove looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years.

I like to think that I am a pretty relaxed person, but this had me on edge. Everything was so dirty that I was anxious to sit down. And to add some perspective I grew up on a dairy farm so I've seen more than my share of disgusting and dirty.

For supper that Friday night we arrived Bridget and I went to the grocery store down the road and picked up a frozen pizza, which I, the guest paid for because she ""didn't have enough money,"" which is always her excuse...

We ate the pizza and I was happy that it wasn't prepared in the kitchen.

Soon after we went to bed. I slept on the couch, which was newer and thus cleaner. She slept in her room which she wouldn't let me see because she said it was so messy.

The next morning her mom cooked breakfast, I don't remember what but I think it was good. I had planned to shower in the morning but I couldn't bring myself to step in their shower which like the bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. 

Then we headed off to Bridget's aunt &amp; uncle's farm where her horses lived. She had a mare and a stallion both were less than 10 years old if I remember correctly. We couldn't ride the horse because of time and another excuse. We fed the horses then went back to town.

After being downtown for a while and walking around we decided to head back to her house. On the way back my stomach started the rumble of death and luckily a gas station was nearby. I'm fairly certain that this was my only ever occurrence of food poisoning.

fatpeoplestories,"So I work in a marketing-ish job and one of my duties is to do presentations to the owners about the various projects that I am working on.

Enter Meeting Ham, she’s my assistant for the day, tasked with helping me set up, ordering food, getting supplies, etc. Easily 350lbs at 5 foot. Gets winded from talking. Thinks a Frappuccino is “just coffee.”

Now, I have been busting my ass for nearly two years, watching my diet, CrossFit every day at 6am, and then sometimes a sparring class in the evening. It’s hard work. I work out 12 hours a week and meal prep, but I don’t freak out if I have to eat a meal that isn’t one of my pre-planned ones. It’s all a balance. I’ve lost 50 lbs of fat and gained almost 12 lbs of muscle (I’ve actually had body scans that have this data). Anyway, it’s obvious to any outside person that I work out, and I don’t really talk about it unless directly asked. Not bragging, just setting the stage. 

Once the company owners arrive and get settled, we’re all around a big table as I fiddle with the images on the screen. MH is still there, setting up supplies. My projector is still warming up so I grab a muffin from the tray of breakfast items available. 

“Oh, carbs are sooo bad for you.” I ignore her. 

“I’ve seen what you normally eat, its like, just so sad.” 

I’ll point out now that this is in front of everyone at this meeting. I continue to ignore her.

“I guess you’re off the diet now, huh? Get ready to have all that weight come back.”

“What?” I say. 

“I’m just saying, I hope you saved all your clothes from before. You’re going to need them soon.” 

“I’ll be fine, thanks.” 

“No, it’s not fine! Someone needs to call you out on this. You come in like you’re sooooo amazing. Like you’re better than everyone else. I can’t wait until you blow back up. So go ahead and have another muffin.”

The owners are silent, pretending to shuffle through papers as this all plays out. Trying to be the better person, I thank her for the input and let her know that we don’t need anything else for our meeting.

“It’s gonna haaaappeeeen,” she says in a sing-song voice while she’s leaving. 

I don’t know what else to say so I sit down at my laptop to begin my presentation. 

After a moment of quiet, one of the owners just says, “Wow.” 

Wow, indeed. 







“",Meeting Ham Feels the Need to “Call Me Out.”
fatpeoplestories,"This happened a while back, but it pissed me off enough to not forget about it so I thought I would share it with all of you. 

First, we have the rude ham, who I will call Carol for the purpose of the story. Carol is probably 65 or so years old, extremely tall and extremely round. Strangely enough, she pretty much only seems to store fat in the belly, so she looks like an elderly octomom. She had always had horrible eating habits, but at the time was packing on much more weight. Literally bulging out of her clothes, but no one could think of a delicate way of suggesting she might cover up a little better. 

My other coworker I'll call Eloise. Eloise is easily one of the nicest people I've ever met, and shes basically like an extra grandmother to me. We aren't related, but shes known me since I was 3, and I feel pretty protective I guess because of it. Like I mentioned, Eloise is a cancer survivor, and has a colostomy bag. Shes been in relative good health, cancer free now, but shes quite underweight and has virtually no appetite and gets an upset stomach very easily, making it very difficult for her to keep at a healthy weight. 

Anyway, one day Eloise had remarked quite happily that she had managed to gain 9lbs. She definitely looked better and I noticed she'd had more energy of late.

That was when Carol muttered, through a mouthful of Arby's, ""Good. One might have thought you were unintelligent.""

What. The. Fuck. Eloise, being the patient woman she is, kind of laughed nervously and asked what she meant by that. To which the inconsiderate ham explained, ""When we were in college, my friends and I all decided that the skinny little girls were all unintelligent. Not like the real girls like us.""

Carol knew that Eloise had cancer. Carol knew that Eloise struggled to eat enough most of the time. And she proceeded to say that, because her insecure ass couldn't help herself but to shit on someone who is trying hard to take care of her health. Eloise kind of just got up and left the office  to get away, while Carol sort of made a half-assed apology about how no one much wanted to date her because of her weight and it hurt.

Keep in mind that this is an older woman, who hasnt been in college for over 40years, still butthurt that men didnt want to date her. I think her rude personality has much more to do with people disliking her than her weight ever did.  

I would have probably gone off on Carol, but Eloise doesn't like conflict and I didnt want to draw things out and make things tense, so I basically just did my best to avoid her as best as I could until I was less annoyed with her.

Well, Carol never really let up about it. Several times I've heard her lecture Eloise about ""needing to eat her some meat and potatoes"" and telling her how she just doesn't understand how she could have no appetite. Sometimes she'll order fast food and keep pushing Eloise to eat more of it, which is really awful to do to someone with a sensitive stomach. Eloise is too polite and argue, and kind of picks at whatever gets shoved her way until Carol finally leaves her alone. I could probably make a lot more Carol-related posts here, and theres most likely going to be more in the future because she really cant keep her mouth shut, and she's got a penchant for skinny-shaming, but I'll leave just this for now

Edit: Since a few people have mentioned it, I do regret not sticking up for Eloise in the past, but more recently I kind of blew up after having gotten sick of her repeatedly eavesdropping on peoples conversations and sort of dressed her down for a whole lot of reasons (shes done a lot of mean shit that isn't really related to this sub that I wanted to get off my chest). Luckily, pretty much everyone that works there is fed up with her for one reason or another, and Carol has mentioned that she might get a job elsewhere because she thinks everyone else is basically bullying her.

Edit 2: We dont have an HR department unfortunately. The place I work is a small retail store, not a chain or anything and has about 10 people there, mostly part timers. The problem is that even the owner is fed up Carol too, but wont do anything about it. Since no one higher up will do anything, everyone sort of tiptoes around Carol because they dont want to piss her off when  they know no will back them up. No one wants Carol even angrier with them because we know reporting her gets nothing done and the bitch holds a grudge forever. It's become a toxic workplace because Carol's found a place where she can be lazy and rude as she likes, knowing that she can act badly and never have consequences.",Ham coworker skinny-shames a cancer survivor
fatpeoplestories,"I met my coworker Rex five years ago when I started as a intern at the company I work for.  Rex is a big guy and when I say big guy I don’t mean big and tall, Rex resembles a bowling ball, he’s five foot six tops and probably about 400 pounds. He’s so heavy my boss has had to replace his office chair numerous times due to them giving out and pieces actually falling off the chairs. 

If Rex was just a big guy it would be one thing but he’s an asshole and pretty insufferable. 

Today I’ll tell the story of how he got fired from ordering Fridays lunches. My employer orders lunch every Friday for us employees. Since Rex was the customer support rep in charge of taking client complaints, setting appointments, etc he was designated lunch orderer.

That job entails sending out a memo wed night with the the option of two restaurants the owners chose say Jason’s deli and Applebee’s. We vote then Thursday morning the winning restaurants link is sent to us Via a Google doc we write down our orders then send them to Rex by Thu night. 

Well what Rex would do is say the office voted pizza vs Sushi and Rex wanted sushi he would just pick what he wanted the rest of us be dammed. He would also order an extra two meals. So three total, one for lunch, one for a snack and one for his dinner. 

After about a year of this and others complaining to the boss that we were not being heard in the vote the boss then gave that job to his personal assistant. 

Of course Rex still orders two meals claiming he needs the food due to his super fast metabolism (wtf)

*Guest appearances from 2 Doxies, 2 goats, and a literal mountain of mud and goat shit*



A bit of context: BigCity has had some pretty fucked up weather this week. Multiple major flooding events over the span of a few days, leading to us having 5 people calling out because they were flooded in and couldn't make it, leading to me working with Bina despite us rarely working together. We were also ecstatic to be leaving BigCity for a long distance because it would mean the other crews got fucked, and we didn't. Regardless. We grab our bari stretcher and another crew, and get to StBigHospital to pick up our patient. Our patient is in her early 70's, 505lbs, maybe 5'1. She a big girl is my point. Completely non ambulatory, cannot assist in any way, meaning we gotta push/pull her onto the stretcher. It takes 8 of us to move her safely, especially since she was squishy and not able to hold herself stiff. [Appropriate meme because it conveys my dismay, and actually she resembles it a bit](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/93/42/7c/93427ccea20a07ced66271b7f5a20adf--never-not-funny-funny-things.jpg) We get her onto the stretcher without anything notable happen, get her to the truck without anything notable, get her in the truck with no problem... I should have seen it coming. The Fuckening that awaited us at her home. We start our drive, and 2 hours later were pulling up to her lovely charming home.



Im sure you can guess that lovely charming home is mildly sarcastic, because we pull up to a dirt lot (now knee deep mud thanks to all the rain over the state) housing two separate trailers that have been joined by a plywood tunnel. Thankfully, they have a ramp and french doors because I don't feel like cutting a wall down on that tin can. Me and Bina let her know were at her home, and she starts squaking at us to get her out of this ding dang stretcher because she's fixing to go numb in the buttcrack. Alright then. Bad news is, Wayne and Duane have arrived to be our lift assist and have told us no can do. We can't push the stretcher through all that mud because with 505lbs on it, its gonna get stuck. So Wayne calls the local FD and they send out their finest young strapping lads. 20 minutes later they show up, her hollering her head off the whole time about how she's fixing to fight us for keeping her on that stretcher. Excuse me? Lady, you cant even lift your leg up an inch, try and fight me lolololol. While were waiting for FD, up rambles two goats and two doxies, all trying to hop in the truck to get to their human. BSI IS MY SCENE SAFE? Nah. Goat tries to headbutt me. ""This is some hick ass shit"" I curse under my breath when finally the FD rolls up. We have to back the ambulance into the dirt lot close to the ramp, then were gonna move our patient to a FattieMat (trademarked) and FD is gonna team carry her into the ~~house~~ trailer. Alright, we got 12 nice young men carrying her through knee deep mud  into her house, while I am of course supervising and looking pretty. I decide to follow into the house and jesus christ the stench of goat shit (did I mention the goat shit EVERYWHERE) old urine, unwashed vagina, and mold hit me flat in the face. The smell inside her bedroom was 1000x worse and more concentrated. We get her settled, then all go outside to gossip and shoot the shit in the street for a bit before moving the trucks. 



FD Supervisor and I are chatting a bit and he says that they are the same crew that got her out of the house for her 911 ambulance a few weeks ago. 'She swears up and down that she doesn't have congestive heart failure. You see her legs? Weeping edema. That and she takes Lasix, there's no way she doesnt have CHF.' 'Oh and she stopped taking her Lasix a few weeks back because it made her pee a lot and she cant get up to use the bathroom so she was peeing on the recliner we just put her in and was giving herself a rash' 

**Excuse me what in the actual fuck**


After shooting the shit for a bit, we realize our truck is stuck in the mud. Gotta get yoinked out by the engine truck, get head butted by the goat again, and were on our merry way.


But seriously, so god damn fat that you cant get up to use the bathroom and instead resort to pissing and shitting on yourself? Stopping a life continuing medication because it makes you pee too much? In the words of Dr Now, alright you can just die then.


I look at my partner Bina and suggest WaffleHouse. We eat our sorrows (keto breakfast for me because GF has inspired a new determination to keep with it) and start to mosey back to BigCity with tales of the backwoods kind of folk we encountered in our journey. Sent a picture of the goat to my supervisor with the caption ""Don't y'all ever send me on this type of hick shit again, ya hear?"" 'BasicBitchMedic, we got another bari call holding if you keep being smart'

fatpeoplestories,"Some friends and I were invited over to someone's house for game night. The hosts like to play a card game that needs about 10-12 people. It's a game where you have to change seats every round. There were more people than that so my friends and I sat in the living room playing a board game while everyone else sat around a long dining table playing the card game.

A big fat lady (350 lbs?), a neighbor of the hosts, was sitting at the dining table. Like I said, in this card game you change seats every hand. Half the chairs were wood, but there were extra metal folding chairs, too. These looked heavy duty, like something you'd have in an office conference room. About 1/2 hour into the game, I look over at the fat lady and notice the metal in her chair is actually twisting under her mass. The seat is moving backwards and toward the ground, but not evenly, because one leg is bending and the whole chair is twisting. I point it out to my friend and we're not sure what to do because we're guests and don't know the hosts well. 

The chair is getting worse and looks like it's getting ready to collapse when the fat lady notices the table is higher because now she's about 6 inches closer to the ground. So she discreetly stands up and notices what happened to the chair. At this point one round is ending anyway so everybody gets up from their chairs. The fat lady moves into the kitchen to get more snacks and refill her drink but she doesn't tell the hosts what she did to their chair. 

She comes back and gets to sit in a new chair, and another woman, ""Sherri"" (small and thin, she's a coworker of the friend I'm sitting with), takes the warped chair. The chair is still twisted but sprung back maybe 1/2 way so it's not as short. At this point my friend and I think the danger is over, but a couple minutes everyone hears a loud snap and the chair collapses completely. Sherri isn't hurt but is shaken and embarrassed. The host woman rushes over and is disturbed at the chair. She borrowed the chairs for game night and looks a little irritated at Sherri. 

I'm assuming after a minute or two everyone pieced together what really happened with the chair, but nothing was said. Once we were in the car my friend told Sherri what happened and it wasn't her fault. We have a running joke with her now where we warn her about sitting in unreinforced chairs and busting them from her weight.",Fat lady destroys furniture
fatpeoplestories,"Read an article today that struck a nerve. Dealing with airports is already bad enough but having to accommodate “passengers of size” is often at the expense of other people. Earlier this week, a plane crash landed in Russia and 41 people perished because they couldn’t evacuate the plane in time. Apparently, many of the victims could’ve rescued themselves if a greedy fucking ham didn’t block the isle retrieving his luggage and blocking people behind him. Then he complains about the rude treatment from the staff. Fucking unbelievable. 

Here’s the link: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6996559/amp/Heroic-stewardess-pushed-passengers-safety-reveals-terror-Russian-plane-crash.html



Makes me think about the experience I had at the airport a few months ago when traveling from Texas to Colorado. When I was waiting for my flight, TWO female employees at the airport wheeled this massive fucking planet to the front of the boarding door for my flight. I have overweight people in my family but they don’t come close to this guys size. If I had to estimate, he had to be well over 500 pounds. 

When they were wheeling this massive whale onto the plane, the wheelchair broke in the doorway of the entry ramp and it took the better part of an hour to get him up, swapped into another wheelchair, and situated on the plane. AND THEN SOMEHOW, I GET THE INCREDIBLY BAD FUCKING LUCK OF SITTING NEXT TO THIS WHALE OF A HUMAN ON THE FUCKING PLANE!!!

He had two seats and the side of his gut was STILL hanging over my armrest and against my arm for the entire flight. I had the isle seat and it was probably the longest 3 hours of my life. 

I’m so frustrated, I don’t even attempt to make small talk with this guy. I tried for a while to get some sleep and just as I was dozing off, the blob nudges me and wakes me up... just to use my fucking tray table because his massive gut was almost against the tray tables in front of him and there’s no way he could let them down. Maybe because I was half asleep, idk, but I said he could use it. 


Sorry for the rant, and I’m an understanding guy, but it fucking drives me crazy how incredibly selfish and greedy some people can be.",Selfish Hams and Airplanes
fatpeoplestories,"This is going to be a long tale. A saga. A literal wall of text. 

But it is related to the group as it involves super fatties. 

I originally wrote this for my restaurant industry/serving group, where I'm known for very long stories, but, although they have some thick skin, it's full of a bunch of ""body positive"", ""anti fat shaming"" types. I didn't want to deal with the backlash, so I've decided to post it here. 

If that's not okay, admin please delete. 

As I've mentioned in passing before, I work managing and serving at a high end sushi bar/hibachi restaurant. The dining area is fairly large, but the owners are trying to get the most out of it. Even weighing in at 5'3 and 135lbs, I can barely squeeze through some of the ""aisles (I use the term loosely)"" comfortably, especially with a tray. And, (this detail will matter later on) my good lord heaven sent 34DD chest. 

This evening we were particularly busy, as prom season is upon us, and apparently kids with their parents credit cards love both overpriced sushi and food cooked in front of them. We were almost at volume, with a FULL reservation book up until our 10pm closing time. 

So, to paint a picture, if you will, I'm running around with 200 different things to do, orders to ring in, people to cash out, and an almost entirely brand new staff that all need some form of assistance. 

Enter the landwhale. 

I hear the whirring strain of her electric wheelchair before I heard the hostess greet her. My spidey senses began to tingle. 

I knew I was in for a shit show. I was about to be the food slave. 

I turn the corner to the hostess stand, and thar she blows. I swear I heard the ""ding ding"" of a boxing ring. It was on. This will be my greatest fight in history. I will have to battle this person into a pleasant dining experience, even though I know nothing will be enough for them. I mentally put on my war paint. 

Tipping the scales at surely no less than 450 lbs, is a fairly young looking woman, with poorly done multi colored dreads, and a prisonesque heart shaped facial tattoo. Of course in her tortured scooter. I've never felt so bad for machinery before. 

In tow, is what I assume is her significant other. Although mobile, he was also at least over 400lbs, with the necessary accessories of an oxygen tank and a Denver broncos cap, that, had not only NEVER been washed, but topped his lovely 4 remaining strands of hair into a foot long pony tail. 

The hostess looks like she's seen a ghost. I step in. I've been training for this moment. I also know that (somehow) the single table we have open for walk ins (roll ins?), that can accommodate a scooter, is actually open. 

I grab their menus, and inform them I'll be taking care of them this evening, if they could just follow me to their table. 

I graciously remove a chair so she can scoot on in, and as I turn to hand her the pen for the sushi menu, it begins. 

""Ummm honey no we can't sit here. We've been here before and at lunch they ALWAYS put us in the half booth! He's got a bad back! He can't sit in these hard chairs. He needs the half booth!!!!""

""Ah I'm so sorry ma'am. I thought this would be a more accommodating table for you. I do apologize. Unfortunately all of the half booths are seated and eating. If you don't mind a wait, I can put you on the waiting list for the half booth. And, ma'am I apologize again but there are reservations so I'm not entirely sure what your exact wait time would be.""

I thought her eyes were gonna roll back in the back of her head. I could physically sense her extreme displeasure, and, at this point in my serving career, I know when a toddler level temper tantrum is in the works. 

""Well I don't know if we can wait. My blood sugar is bad and we already drove all the way here, if I don't get something soon I'm going to be SICK. And there's no where for him to sit while we wait. HES GOT A BAD BACK!""  

""Yes ma'am. I totally understand that. Let me see what I can do about letting you know what a wait time might be for you!""

Please remember. I'm a manager. I can't lose my mind on this giant maniac like she deserves. 

Now in this moment, one of the half booths asks their server for a togo box and a check. She's prompt with it, and I suppose the goddamned superfat saw the togo box being dropped at the table. 

Like a bull charging a matadors red cloth, she puts the joystick to the metal, heading gut first to this half booth. This poor half booth. This wholesome family, who just wanted to have a nice meal and not have to explain to their children what the fuck this woman was. 

She stops MAYBE a foot and a half from the table, 3 strand oxygen Larry making his way slowly behind her. She, and I shit you not, loudly informed this poor family that ""we have been waiting on this table for over an hour and we have disabilities! He needs to sit!""

Rightfully mortified, the family acts like they've been cornered by a wild animal. Boxing up their food while never turning their backs and refusing eye contact. Scuttering out the door, all but ignoring my profuse apologies. 

This fucking fat bitch roller derbies the chair side of the half booth, pushing the chair out of her way, even though I was on my way to bus the table and accommodate her. 3 strand oxygen Larry pushes the table out as he squeezes in. I'm by the table side in less than 15 seconds. Mortified. 

""Alright so how long are we gonna sit at a dirty ass table before you get our order in?! I already let you know IM SICK"" 

""Yes ma'am. And I do apologize, but I need to remove this extra chair to clear some room, and I need to bus your table and wipe it down. Also if you could please not use that language with me, I'd appreciate it."" 

Huffs. So many huffs. 

I get the table done and clean, drop her some menus. Ask if I can start them with some beverages while they overlook the menu. Also informing them that at the time we are at volume for the kitchen and the sushi bar, so their order will take a minimum of 30-40 minutes. 

They both decide on 2 strawberry lemonades each (I'll finish one before you have time to make another!!!) as well as a DIET coke for her, and two ice waters. They're also ready to order. Everything on the menu that's fried, basically. 

I'll never understand someone that comes to a sushi bar and treat it like KFC. We have beautiful fresh rolls, amazing grilled salmon salads, hand cut steaks cooked to order with fresh season veggies...but I digress. 

After I put their order in, make their lemonades so sickly sweet surely they can't get through two of them, business picks up. I'm forced to seat other new patrons around them as tables clear up, with this fat fucks chair in all of our way. The surrounding patrons are visibly disgusted, but obviously trying to keep the staring to a minimum cause ""discrimination"", I suppose. 

15 minutes in (I note ticket order times at the top of the ticket so no one can claim they've been waiting an hour when they haven't), I'm painfully squeezed next to this woman's chair, attempting to take an order from the table next hers. She interrupts me WHILE IM INTERACTING WITH THIS SEPARATE TABLE, grabs my ARM, ""excuse me. We were here before them and I need your assistance. We have been waiting over 45 minutes for our food now. I know I told you IM SICK and need my FOOD!""  

I give a look to the table I'm assisting that says ""y'all both know I gotta deal with this bitch"". Knowing nods all around, bless those folks. 

""Yes ma'am! I need to get this table some drinks first, but I promise you the kitchen and sushi chefs are diligently working on your order! I only put it in about 15 minutes ago, so please understand it will be just a little bit longer. You mentioned a blood sugar issue? May I get you another lemonade while you wait?""

Gal at the table next to them snort laughs. I have to bite the inside of my mouth until I almost taste blood to keep from joining her. 

Fatty waves me away with her ham hock arm. 

I keep caring for my other tables, trying my best to ignore the literal goddamned elephant in the room. Since I manage, and we pool tips, I let some other gals keep their lemonades refilled and deal with her huffing. I'll deal with her ultimately in the end. Because we all know there's going to be problems. 

Finally their food is up to be ran, and our new, barely English speaking food runner goes to get it. 

""No, mijo. Es para la gorda, muy mal. No quieres.""  

I don't speak great Spanish, but he got the point that he didn't want anything to do with this fatty...

Another table has been sat behind them, pinning the fatty in, making it almost physically impossible for me to drop this tray of deep fried fish fat off. 

I start squeezing myself through the normal sized diners the best I can, apologizing along the way. After about the 2nd table, everyone in the restaurant knows by my look of utter dispair; I'm headed for the fats. They part like the Red Sea. The man of the couple at the table does his best to scoot in, but, it's not enough. I suck it in the best I can, but, then it happens. 

I lift the tray above my head, but cannot help grazing her back with my breasts, and jarring her chair a bit as I pass. 

As I'm apologizing, and looking for a sweet spot to start putting their food on the table, this morbidly obese kraken awakens. 

""OWWW! EXCUSE ME!!!! Did you just HIT my CHAIR!"" 

I apologize, with my best veteran server fake sincere voice, ""Oh my, ma'am, I am so very sorry. I just wasn't able to squeeze by. Are you okay? I didn't mean to hit your chair at all!""  

Then, a first happened for me.
I've been doing this for almost 15 years. I've been called A LOT of names by my customers in this industry. Needless, crazy insults. I've been called a dumb bitch, a racist bitch, a lazy bitch, a retarded bitch, even a fat useless bitch.

""Are you suggesting that I was in YOUR way? With my DISABILITY? YOU ABLEIST BITCH!"" was howled at me. 

The restaurant, again, falls to near silence. 

""I'm so sorry for the inconvenience ma'am, but if we can't use proper language, with a proper volume in my dining room, I will have to ask you to leave and not return."" 

She started swelling up and turning colors like that little girl from Willy Wonka. I expected her to scream ""I want an Oompa Loompa NOW!"".

""I want to speak with your fucking manager! This is DISCRIMINATION!""  

Crowning moment for me. 

""Yes ma'am. I'm sorry you feel that way. I am the manager on duty this evening"". 

She insisted that they were going to leave due to my treatment of them, wouldn't be paying, and want everything boxed up

""Yes ma'am. You're more than welcome to leave my restaurant, and at this point, I'm insisting you do. But unless you are paying, I will not be boxing your meal up. I will comp your beverages ($17 worth of flavored lemonades) for the inconvenience and miscommunication we've seem to have had this evening.""  

Then, and Miley Cyrus said it best, she came in like a wrecking ball. 

At this point EVERYONE is staring, watching her try to 12 point turn and escape in her chair. No one is team fatty by now. No one scoots. I swear the guy behind her actually scooted his chair out, forcing her to hit him repeatedly in her flee attempt. Literal tears almost rolling down his chin from amusement. I wanted to get his name and invite him to my 600lb life group I'm in. 

I proceed to walk away. I'm done with her, and her trying to get the best of me. 

She finally manages to wiggle out, almost to the edge of the table. Fatass Larry; sat calmly with his oxygen the entire time, never standing until she had freed herself like a beached whale flipping towards the shore...I believe he had seen the scene transpire before. 

She gets to the edge of the table, grabs a HANDFUL of shrimp tempura COVERED in spicy mayo, and shoves the entire thing in her mouth, scooting quickly for the door. 

I'm. So. Fucking. Done. 

""I'm sorry ma'am. Youre going to need to pay for that appetizer now. And I'll be happy to pack up the remainder for you."" (2 fucking shrimp, max, after she monkey fisted the rest into her maw). 

""Fuck you ableist bitch! You'll hear from MY LAWYER"". 

Lady. You're not making a quick escape. I had plenty of time to make my way, slowly even, her cussing me like an old dog the entire time, to their handicap van to write down the plates. 

She's been reported for theft of services and petty theft. 

The cops didn't follow up with me as of yet, and after I got off I didn't really care and just wanted to leave. But I'd love to hear the speech she gave the officer about why she needed to scoot off with a mouthful off fried shrimp. 

I hope they got you, you useless waste of space. I hope they got you and you're waiting on bond and have to explain to your family why they have to pay a 1k bond for some goddamned fatty foods you shouldn't be eating and probably can't afford. I hope you call the CO of the women's block an ableist bitch because you can't fit in the bunks and only get one mat, a bologna sandwich and an apple while you're there.

If you work in law enforcement, and are also in this group, and have to give this woman the nude patdown, roll, squat and cough check...I'm sorry. 

But she stole those goddamned shrimps. 

And that's the end of my story.

fatpeoplestories,"Hey guys, haven't posted in awhile, because honestly my mental health has been shit and I've spent most of my free time on boards that supported the issues I was going through.

So this will be about the beginning of the fall of Hama. The last post on the topic was about our friendship starting to sour. That was in highschool, but our friendship didn't end till college. 

Brief descriptions: 
Hama tall and fat, shaped like a bowling pin and somehow has no ass or tits. Jealous and mean.

Friends: *same name as me* so we'll call her ""othermass"" or OM she's shortish and slim. Nerdy and sweet.

Zedd is taller and slim hourglass. Won't take shit, honest. 

Me ""Mymass"" short, petite, no boobs and had a butt. Tired, snarky, needs a break.

When college started Hama was actually acting like she had at the beginning of our friendship. Her bf was at our college so I actually got to interact with him. 

She still fluctuates between ""omg I love him so much!"" And ""I wish I could be with 'specific guys name'"". This semester I took a self defense gym class, this class had an emphasis on leg strength. So basically: my butt got bigger. She honed in on that and made comments often about my butt ""it's just so big now, how do you fit in your pants?"" Or ""I can't wait till you can't wear those pants anymore cuz your ass gets too big"" or even ""your all ass at this point"" (mind you, my butt wasn't even that big,she just went crazy over it and clearly fixated on it), and about how any guy that dated me would either be gay ""cuz guys that like butts are gay"" or a pedo ""cuz you look like a little kid"". Fun times, glad to know she's a gay pedo I guess? Seeing as she also didn't stop trying to get me to date her.

Ella didn't go to our college, but Zedd basically stepped up to the plate to call Hama out on her shit. It wasn't as direct or agressive but she'd be like ""don't you have a boyfriend?"" and ""doesn't it hurt your neck looking down to stare at her ass that much?"" 

Hama always seemed offended but would also stop for the rest of the day.

One day Hama and I had an argument. Not a big thing, just a disagreement about something. It happened all the time and it always ended civilly. I thought it was done so I excused myself to the bathroom. When I get back Hama was gone and my friends Othermass and Zedd looked uncomfortable. Othermass broke the silence,

""Hey, uh... Mymass?""

Me: yeah

OM: what did you do when you left just now?

Me: oh I just had to go to the bathroom, I thought I mentioned it before leaving.

OM: okay that's what I thought happened...

Me: Why?

OM: well... when you left Hama said that she uh... she hopes you won't hit her again.

I was PISSED. I am a pacifist. The only times I've touched Hama were when I was just trying to get her away from me (after she hit me I pushed her) or on reflex to her biting me. I told her as much.

Zedd: is that what she's always talking about? Are you kidding me?

Me: always? What?

OM: literally everytime you guys have an argument and you leave she says something about being afraid of you. I thought she was exaggerating and we always change the subject before you get back. Today she said it and when we tried to change the topic she got mad. She said she was serious and that you're scary. 

Zedd: she may have also acted like you went into self defense to make her afraid of you.

OM: I'm glad this got sorted out because this honestly didn't sound like you. Zedd even said that and then Hama ran off crying. I'm surprised you guys didn't bump into each other.

Then I asked the question that would lead to Hama's unraveling,
""What else did she say about me?""

Then the tidal wave hit. She was talking so much shit about me. That I'm abusive. That I'm homophobic. That I lead her on. THAT I CONFESSED TO BEING A LESBIAN AND IN LOVE WITH HER! 

That's when I pulled out my phone and made a group chat, every single person in our friend group except Hama. We basically got together and shared all the shit she'd been saying, screenshots galore. [This was 2 phones and 4 years ago. I wish i did but I don't have the chat log anymore] we'd also talk about her various abuses towards us. I learned she was shaming our mutual friend into quitting her diet. She was hitting on another girl's boyfriend. That she often talked about me being delusional about my sexuality because I didn't date. Just a whole lotta awful.

At that point we all just quit. This wasn't the absolute ""stop talking to me you're a shitty person"" breaking point, but we all basically ignored her or stopped responding to her. If she talked to us we'd talk to her, but she never wanted to put in the effort. Instead she get pissy with us and storm off. No one wanted to directly cut ties with her and no one wanted to talk to her.

But did she go quietly into the night? Of course not.",Hama the Jealous Whale: the beginning of the end
fatpeoplestories,"Why why WHY do some people have ZERO spatial awareness?

M’lady and I had just landed Midway (Chicago) after a flight from LA. We were tired, hungry and just wanted to collect our bags and get home. We were standing at the carousel slightly down the line a bit when a hamplanet and her just-as-rotund daughter shuffle along and plant themselves RIGHT IN FRONT of us. Their stench was powerful. They were yabbering on about some unimportant nonsense with no regard for us or anyone else within ear/nose-shot. My gf’s bag appears and so she circumnavigates the two hams to grab her bag. There were some nice people who stepped aside to let her in. She picks up her bag, and is within the personal space of the two loud stinky heaving mounds of flesh to do so. Do they give her room? No. Do they step aside to allow her to get away from the carousel with her bag? Of course not. It took her a good moment of staring at them and a ‘well, isn’t this great’ snarky well-placed and appropriate comment before they realised that other people in this world exist aside from them. They finally take the hint and shift their fridge-bodies aside to allow her past. See? That wasn’t too hard was it.

fatpeoplestories,"MIL is 62 and probably weighs 300 pounds. She considers a walk through Walmart to the chips aisle to be exercise.

She’s never done any intentional real exercise since I’ve known her, and has been doing really lazy things her whole adult life, like using a shoehorn instead of bending over to put on her shoes, or avoids regular-height toilets because they’re way too low, and opts for handicapped toilet stalls. And she says things like, “Well, what can I do, it’s just my age and once a person reaches a certain age you just gotta [insert lazy behavior]” Like, no Deb, you’ve been doing these lazy things for 20+ years. 

I recently started doing fitness classes to shed pregnancy weight, and I asked if she would be interested in trying an aqua aerobics class—lots of seniors go to it, it’s low-impact, and might help with some of her aches and pains. But NO, no no, according to her, any sort of workout class is just self-indulgent and excessive, and implied how selfish I am to carve out time to exercise a few times a week since I’m a SAHM and apparently I need to be tied to housework and raising my kids 24/7. Because, ya know, she was also a SAHM and SHE never did any workout classes, therefore why would I feel the need to?

Also makes me wonder her logic when she prides herself on eating from a smaller plate to trick her brain into thinking she’s eating more.

The weird thing is, is that I love being active and have always adored healthy foods. Sadly, I just never put the two into action, and so I was obese for most of my middle/high school years (almost 10 in total).  This particular fps journey is when my parental unit would take me to Starbeetus before school. I hated the bus because I was self-conscious and all of the usual ""former-fat"" kid fears. Now I love coffee and as a 16 year LOVED coffee milkshakes and breakfast sandwiches. This Monday morning, however, my chubby brain would witness something insane; 

I'm walking into my local Starbeetus going to grab a Grande chocolate coffee concoction and a breakfast sandwich. In front of me are Sweetheart 1 and Sweetheart 2, both are incredibly nice girls who are cheerleaders at my school. We say hi and continue until I hear their orders; 2 grande iced coffees with half n half and a fruit cup each. Suddenly my brain short-circuited because why settle for fruit when you could have a pound of bacon and eggs on butter bread for breakfast?!?!? But this huge voice in my head was screaming: THAT'S HOW THEY STAY A HEALTHY SIZE. THEY EAT NORMALLY. I continued to get a coffee, a sandwich and a loaf of lemon bread after they had left. I didn't want Sweetheart 1+2 to know how much I ate. Hid that lemon loaf and sandwich in my backpack so my unit didn't find it; ""The coffee's enough right now, I'm trying to cut back!"". My parents looked so happy, and that hope broke my heart because I knew I was going to binge later. For whatever reason, this revelation didn't sink in fully, but it has stayed with me since. 

The reason I'm writing this is that I'm currently eating cut up strawberries for breakfast and don't have the need to add to it. A lot of fat people would have a cup of strawberries AND a yogurt AND granola and call it a ""light breakfast."" In college, I seriously changed my eating habits because I didn't want to die or live a life immobile. My highest was 255lb, and the reality of the damage I was causing to my body hit me so hard. I'm comfortable with a fruit cup and a cup of coffee now because my life isn't being held together with food. So thank you Sweetheart 1 and 2, because you being healthy has continued to motivate me for the past year to get my butt down from 225 to 180. I have 50lbs left to go and so many stories from when I was bigger.",The anomaly of a fruit cup
fatpeoplestories,"I work 3rd shift. I have a coworker on 2nd shift who uses his diabetes as an excuse for being terrible at his job while having some rather interesting logic.

Depending on the day and his telling of the story, he's either, seen the doctor and they say he's not even prediabetic but he knows he has diabetes becuase of his family history. Or,  he's not seen the doctor becuase he knows they will say he's not diabetic but he knows he is.

He brings his test kit to work and makes a show of testing his blood sugar. BUT If anyone brings in candy or baked goods he turns into a human vaccum cleaner.

One day a couple girls on 1st shift in the other department brought in doughnuts for their department and shift. they were nice enough to email our department about the doughnts becuase there are normaly some leftover doughnuts. The coworker (remember, who works 2nd shift in another department) got mad 1st shift didn't save him a doughnut.",Umm... ok...?
fatpeoplestories,"Now I know this doesn’t mean your a ham planet but for the most part you find heavy people to be heavy breathers.

I’m 6”1 and 350 pounds so definitely a ham, but one thing I learned from kickboxing and wrestling is breathing control. I’m self conscious about how loud I breathe so I learned to control it and sound pretty quiet. Of course when I work out I breathe heavy because I’m tired but that’s really it. 

I had a job interview las week for a driving position and I was interviewed by this guy and this lady. The lady was the ham planet in this case. She was pretty big. Look like she was hitting 300 plus. 

Now the whole time the manager was interviewing me her breathing was out of this world.. I know people who have asthma when breathing hard will inhale their medication but I never saw her take one out so I can confirm she was just a mouth breather. I’m not overreacting when I said I can barely hear the manager because of the loud breathing. I started asking her questions that way I can hear the whole convo. 

Now again this is just my opinion that the breathing is annoying. I know some people have conditions that make it hard to control ones breathing, but for HPs they can control it but just decide to let it all out.",Heavy breathers

English is not my first language and writing not my forte so bear with me. Its kinda sorta worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, as usual, the protagonists :

&amp;#x200B;

Me, Mahoogany, 13/14-ish at the time, already chubby but nothing alarming. Yet. Typical teenager in vacation at the family house, basically wants to be left alone with a good book and periodically goes for strolling/reading/sightseeing in the sunflower fields for a few hours every day just to stay out of reach from everyone. Has to come back for lunch, unfortunately.

&amp;#x200B;

Supercousin, 35, basically wonder-woman. Fit, beautiful, works a nice job, has a lovely husband and the two cutest children ever. I looked up at her so much at the time I could have broken a neckbone.

&amp;#x200B;

Aunt Flabbie, 55, the meanest bitch in the family (see comments for disgression and rant). She weights a good 250/270 lbs, not THAT planetary but flabby as HECK. Rolls like a fleshy cairn. Body like a plastic bag full of jell-o. Her weight/inner rage gave her a very ""indelicate"" way of moving and interacting with things. Her intense frustration at being celibate gave her a very ""indelicate"" way of interacting with people.

&amp;#x200B;

Short story one : an ice crime

End of lunch. Everybody took a piece of fruit, a scoop of ice cream or biscuits, except Flabbie who ""cares about her weight"" and makes a big show of not wanting dessert. 

Then, she notices the carton of ice cream and says that ""we have to finish it, the freezer is full so it's no use keeping a big empty carton of ice cream that blocks the way"". She actually ""finished"" 9 to 10 scoops of ice cream with a violence that I have only witnessed when feeding big dogs or horses. 

Supercousin kindly tells her that maybe, you know, her diet.... The answer was something that I can't decently write here.

&amp;#x200B;

Short story two : fish is fish, you know !

Lunch again (12 french people on family vacation tend to turn lunch into a daily 3 hour/five-act play).

Meat is on the menu. Nothing too fatty : it's warm so we subsist on barbecue, chicken, grilled fish and the occasional sausage, no time for sauces or anything.

Flabbie's doctor warned her against meat, and told her to eat fish sometimes, so she sulks and whips out her own dish. 2 cans of cod liver. In oil. 

Supercousin kindly tells her that if she's on a diet, white meat would be a better option than the fattiest part of a fatty fish, cooked and covered in oil. She retorts that doctor's orders were fish, any fish, so if that's not forbidden on the list then it's allowed. 

Nobody has the heart to tell her that ""common sense"" was not forbidden either... We later discover that she had stockpiled cans of what is basically 75% of fat disguised as fish.

Anyway, thanks for reading, and thanks for helping me sticking with my diet AND laugh !","Icecream, fish, and a thank you note"
fatpeoplestories,"So I’m not a vegetarian, but I have been exploring non-meat options for fun and to see how they react with my (sensitive) gut. I gotta say, some of the non-meat recipes I tried have been great and I prefer them over actual meat because I don’t feel like a bloated mess after I eat them.

Anyway, I’m at the grocery store. I’m a guy, 5’7”, 145 lbs, 9% body fat. I look good, frankly. I live in Chicago, but I was in the suburbs visiting my parents, at the grocery store buying food for dinner I was gonna make tonight. The suburbs of Chicago are MUCH more overweight than the city itself. Less ways to get around without a car, walking to the nearest store — any store - can often take half an hour or longer depending on where you live so it’s not always worth it. I personally love walking but I get why people in the suburbs just drive everywhere, hell I grew up there. I used to be that way too.

Anyway, I was planning on making spaghetti with soy meatballs, so I loaded my basket with produce for the sauce: tomatoes, onions, garlic, carrots, orange, and I grabbed some fresh basil. I was staring at the non-meat proteins and settled on plant-based “ground meat.” I overheard this guy next to me make a...scoffing sound? That’s the best way to put it. I look at him and he’s clearly looking at me.

He’s tall, a little under six feet I’d say. Mid-late 40s. Graying. In the city, he’d be borderline obese. In the suburbs, he’s slightly overweight. So like...275 lbs? Idk I’m not good at guessing. I try not to judge people by their weight, and I expect people to do the same to me. Well I guess that’s too high of an expectation for some.

I ask him what his deal was and he said “no wonder you’re such a twig; you’re too busy eating that fake meat bullshit to actually get the nutrients you need. You need real meat to survive.” Bitch, my basket is full of vegetables. There’s nothing *but* nutrients in here. His cart was FILLED with processed crap, including a bunch of frozen pre-prepared meat. Stuff I avoid like the plague. I’m also not a cat, I really don’t need meat to survive quite honestly. It tastes great and I love it, but lately I’ve been preferring non-meat proteins for health related reasons.

I explain that all to him, albeit more nicely. This guy has the audacity to say “you queers worry about the frilliest bullshit.” That’s a direct quote. It’s burned into my memory. For the record, i am *incredibly* homosexual. My voice is on the masculine side though, so in the city I blend in with The Straights™️. In the suburbs however, I stick out like a sore thumb to some. I was dressed like a typical city hipster, which is how I always dress, and in the suburbs anything that isn’t a T-Shirt and jeans on a guy means that guy has The Big Gay™️. Regardless of that, apparently, caring about the health of my gut means that I’m gay, and that’s bad?? Yeah, whatever you ulcerative-colitis looking bitch.

I’m using humor to cope with my anger at him. Because goddamn typing all this out is bringing some anger out of me. Before anyone asks, yeah I thought about getting a staff member but they likely wouldn’t care and I didn’t want to cause a scene. So I just walked away. As I did, he said “eat some real food, twig.” Yeah, I’m legit about to go do that. Enjoy your Tyson Any-Tizers™️ for dinner for the fifth night in a row you sad sack of shit.",I got skinny shamed at the grocery store for not buying meat.

fatpeoplestories,"Every now and then, my company has catered lunches for all the staff, often the food is delicious. We all love it, especially my manager. My manager moves slower than a goddamn sloth, but whenever there is a catered lunch, she’s always first in line. Always. It’s uncanny. One time there was free In N’ Out and she actually ran.
 
So one day, the company got a whole pasta bar for us. A pasta station was set up in one of the office’s conference rooms. There was trays of different pastas, some appetizers such as breadsticks  and even dessert consisting of brownies and cookies. There was a LOT of food, there’s 110 people in my office, there was enough for everyone to come back for thirds.
 
I hear the announcement and proceed to walk over to the conference room. I arrive at the conference room and lo and behold my manager is standing there, her chihuahua in her arm (dog friendly office), first in line. The station opens and my manager proceeds to take TWO plates. Now please note she had her dog in her other arm, so the entire time she’s only using one hand to grab food for her two plates. Why she didn’t just leave the dog at her desk or put it on the ground is unknown. She’s holding up the line and I see everyone around me rolling their eyes or just staring and thinking WTF. No one has the balls to say anything because she has seniority and because my company has a very “accepting” environment.
 
She finally gets to the end of the station with her two plates in one hand and her dog in her other arm. Now being a hamplanet, her balance and coordination is not very good and the amount of food she put on her two paper plates is way more than they could handle. I notice her hand shaking and all of a sudden she drops both plates of food. She lets out this shriek. All the pasta, breadsticks, cookies, all gone to waste. Everybody is just staring in shock, others (including myself) were snickering.   
 
She then just stares at the food on the ground and mutters: “Yeah, I’m not cleaning this.” She complains about the plates being too thin and then “asks” (more like forced) our facilities guy Dan to clean it for her. Now Dan is a very nice guy who was patiently standing in line with me, his face just sunk and he left the line and got the cleaning supplies. Again people are very irritated but no one can really say anything due to her being a higher up. With no remorse, she goes back to the front of the line, gets her food and then trudges to her desk. She doesn’t even thank Dan.",Hamplanet manager takes too much food and drops it. Refuses to clean it up
fatpeoplestories,"So my boss is a total hamplanet and has that “can I speak to your manager” haircut (and attitude). If you don’t know what that haircut is just google it and you’ll understand. 
 
One day we were talking about how many hours of sleep we got every night. She tells me she only sleeps three hours a night due to the extra hours she works (she’s a complete workaholic) and because she has problems falling asleep, but it’s fine because she only needs three hours of sleep per night to function during the day. Now this is complete bullshit, because I literally see her dozing off at her desk every other day and she’s always sick.
 
So I advise her to try melatonin, just to take it for several days to help her sleep and to develop a better sleep schedule. She’s immediately repulsed by the idea and tells me she would never do that as she is very self-conscious and careful of what she puts in her body. She pretentiously chastises me for using melatonin (which I don’t) and then proceeds to chow down on her daily lunch of Taco Bell, a large cup of Sprite, and cookies.",Hamplanet manager tells me she’s self-conscious of what she puts in her body
fatpeoplestories,"Just a quick summary of a bully over a few years, and the joys of karma.

Bully, age 19/20: 
Gym rat - thinks fat people are gross. Says anyone who doesn't lift weights is a loser. Makes fun of ""weaklings"" who can't eat an entire pizza in one sitting. Flexes at anyone who looks towards him.

Bully, age 22/23: 
Getting stocky from his trash pizza diet. Still hates fat people, ""It's their fault for being fat"".  Belittles anyone at the gym who isn't as big as him.

Bully, age 24 (now):
Rapid weight gain. Completely let himself go, looking like an overstuffed sausage in his clothes.
""Bulking"" is now an excuse for getting fat.  Gets called out on by his bully friends for becoming a fatass.
Former ""weaklings"" are now in better shape than him.

Dude went from bullying everyone about their body, to becoming fat and receiving similar hateful comments! Life went full circle on him.

fatpeoplestories,"Hi everyone! LTL, FTP blah blah.  I'm using a throwaway for reasons.

So I moved to the south five years ago, first Virginia, now Florida.  I've encountered more fat people than my northwestern ass imagined but few hamplanets.  These fatties, for the most part, are self aware, polite, and don't spout fatlogic.  So until my neighbor I've had nothing to share with you guys.

There is a couple who live in the building next to me.  We both live on the first floor and have patios that open into a lovely backyard.  I usually see them when they ""walk"" the dog, meaning they put him on a leash, walk the two feet necessary for him to do his business and go back in. (In case you're wondering, the dog does seem healthy and happy.) They don't pick up after him and during a recent chat with one of our maintenance guys who mows the lawn I said something about how much poop they must have to steer around.  He informed me that they call every so often to have maintenance come pick up poop.  Not in the job description but if they don't do it they'll run it over with the mowers.  The reason given by female fatty (ff)? She can bend over but standing back up hurts her back and makes her wheeze. 

The male in this couple is fat, yes, but nowhere near ff.  She is spherical and judging from the my body gallery pics on here I'd say at least 300 pounds.  There's your appetizer, let me get to the main course that inspired this post.

So the way my complex is set up has ff's building on one side of mine and the pool and laundry room on the other.  Our buildings aren't big, two stories with four units in each building.  I was heading for the laundry room and saw ff getting out of the pool.  She was wearing a bikini and i couldn't see any bottoms because of the draping fat.  It was not pleasant.  I smiled and nodded, she glared as usual and threw a towel around her waist.  Another neighbor from the other side of the pool was heading our way.  I waved, she waved, ff turned to husband who was lounging on a chair and said, ""guess we should leave so the sticks can have the pool.""  (I'm sure it doesn't require mentioning but both myself and other neighbor are petite women.) She switched her glare between the two of us until I entered the laundry room.

When I came out, the two of them were getting in their car and she was talking about how much swimming she had done, so much exercise!  Let me reiterate, they were getting IN THE CAR.  They live one short building length from the pool.  

I'll be sure to add more stories about ff if they happen.  She usually just glares, hearing her speak is rare for me as we're not in the same place often.  Thanks for reading!",Fat neighbor and the pool
fatpeoplestories,"  

My sister is super craftsy and home-makery. One thing makes really well is elaborate chocolates, and when the holidays come around, she brings hem to every gathering! One thing about her food, it’s all egg-meat-dairy-free, which I guess is offensive to older/conservative people. But she’s a huge animal lover and makes good food despite it, so who cares!

Today she brought some of these chocolates to Easter lunch and left them with the other food. My aunt, the stereotypical “Real men like curves, dogs like bones,” kind of lady devoured most of them. I overheard her talking them up to her young (and ballooning) daughter. Later my sister tells her she’s glad she liked the vegan chocolates, and aunt says “Vegan? So that’s why they tasted odd.”

fatpeoplestories,"Since so many of you liked my last post, I thought I'd tell you all one more story about why you should be friendly to your local undertakers, and keep your weight in check.

So when someone passes away, the funeral home gets the call, and if the death occurs at a hospital, we send one person to go get them, if it's at a house, we send two. One day, manager gets a call, someone has passed away at home. He sends me (a little under 5 feet tall, ) and Lady Embalmer,( who is 5 tall feet tall exactly). At this point, we have no idea who the person is, other than age, name etc. So we get to the house, and the family come greet us. Tell us he's in the living room. Okay. ""are you two the only ones?"" Yes, is that a problem"" ""We'll let you look at Uncle xyz"".

&amp;#x200B;

Uncle xyz is about 600 pounds, sitting in a recliner (most obese people will live in their recliners). We call back to the funeral home to see what we should do in the case of a bariatric decedent. They send out two more people. One is a volunteer firefighter, he decides we need to get fire involved since our gentleman might not fit out the front door, because we still have to do everything with great respect, no matter size, and we can't jostle ya around. Fire comes, and decides that the gentleman will not fit out the front door, but he will fit out living room window because it opens. So at this point the family comes in to help, we get him out of the chair, though the window to our waiting van, which has a stretcher he will fit on. Get him in the car, family apologizes for the work, and of course we tell them it was no problem whatsoever. He is to be cremated, so that is where my job ends, but I get to reconvene for the funeral. Funeral day, the whole family is there, plus quite a few other people. Each family member got up and spoke, first about him, and then at the end they all discussed the implications his weight had on them, they all had started eating like him, he couldn't participate in any activities, they were starting to go down the same path. They all ended by imploring the people in attendance to live a healthy lifestyle, and for the reception, served all sorts of salads. I recently saw one family member, who told me that they'd all lost a bunch of weight (they themselves were down 250) and said the turning point was when they realized he couldn't even fit through a front door.",When A Ham Passes Away
fatpeoplestories,"Decided to become a funeral director. Bad plan. First day of embalming and we get notice of a death, and to prepare for “someone slightly abnormal.” This is not descriptive at all.  Funeral directors come in to embalming room with a tape measure, and measure our large doors, then leave again. Come back to tell us the deceased is three inches too wide to fit through. Go out to see and they actually have the lady in the back of a moving van. She takes up the whole width. 

Balls.

Ask about her, she’s over 70 which is amazing considering.
We decide we will need to take the doors off their hinges to get her in. Do so. Still an inch left. Take the framing off the doorway. Finally, we’ll be able to do this. Funeral directors tell us that the fire station helped them get her in the van, but now how the hell do we get her out. Decide on sliding her down progressively shorter ramps until she gets directly on the floor. It takes 20 of us to move her. Funeral directors and everyone else leaves, now it’s just us embalmers. Four of us.  Get her into the room, but realize she’s on the floor and she needs to be on the embalming table. Also realize there isn’t a way in God’s planet earth she’s going to meet the weight restrictions on the table. Check what her DC says, it actually says they couldn’t weigh her but their estimate was over 700 pounds. Call the manufacturer of the embalming table, their restriction is 600, they tell us if we put her on it, we risk damaging hydraulics, nothing else we can do.

Go to Home Depot, buy the biggest industrial pulley they have, screw it into the ceiling, tie a rope around it, then around the tarp we have her in.  Four of us pull, she isn’t moving at all. Call all the others and tell them they need to drop everything and get back here. 20 of us pull, and she’s maybe a foot off the ground. One of us needs to get under her and push up. Guess who gets that task. Anything for the family eh? I get under and push, finally some movement. She’s now hovering over the table, pulley rips out of the ceiling and she falls a good foot straight down. Dents the metal embalming table. A huge, 5 inch dent. We had to use every bit of embalming fluid we had, which would normally be enough for 6 people. It also took 8 hours. Request they bring us her casket. More  issues because it is of course even wider, no way they’re gonna get it in, we have to take her to it. By this time we got a specialized lift from the ME, so it’s easier. Dress, makeup, she looks good now. Funeral directors have already located a horse drawn hearse she can fit in so that we don’t have to present her in a moving van. Appreciative family, were happy, and I went on a diet soon after because I realized my habits were unhealthy and I was heading in that direction.

Edit: further down I suggested her casket was almost 10 feet across. It wasn’t, it was 50 inches. I checked. I never did have an aptitude for height. Once I thought our hearse was 100 feet long. Anyways just wanted to clear that up because god am I dumb",Embalming someone over 800 pounds
fatpeoplestories,"So this happened last summer when I was visiting Disney in Florida with family. We had been there for about a week at this point and today we had decided to go to blizzard beach which is a waterpark for those who don’t know. Anyway my maws chilling on the lounger so me my brother and step da decide to go give some of the slides a bash as u would. Get to the top of the queue for this family slide, one of the slides that have the big rafts that can sit like 6-8 people. My bro stepda and I all get into it with this INCREDIBLY LARGE lady with her 2 toddler age kids, who are sitting across from us at the other side of the raft. The slide had these turns where the raft would go really high up the sides of the slide... or that’s what’s supposed to happen. What actually happened was whenever the big woman was at the top side the raft barely went up the side at all, and when she was at the bottom we were almost falling over the sides of it haha. Anyway, coming to the end of the slide the raft is coming down this straight part and we suddenly come to a halt. Almost like there was an extremely large weight on one side of the raft in the shape of a big arse. The 3 of us know exactly what’s happened but this big woman’s just started shouting about how there’s too much water in the raft and that it must of got inside it during our descent. It’s worth noting that the raft had holes in it BY DESIGN to stop such a thing from happening. She kept whaling on tho about how there was too much water and attempted to SCOOP THE WATER OUT with her hands. The 3 of us and the big burd ended up getting out and pushed it along to the end of the slide.

Am probably quite shite at telling this but it’s a fat person story so there u go

fatpeoplestories,"So, I work at an airport, and I am not thin myself. I am 5'6 and I weigh around 180 lbs, but I weighted 250 2 years ago, and I am finally somewhat comfortable in my body.

As a former very fat person, I would never, ever criticise someone's size, because that shit hurts and I had to endure a lot of bullying when I was younger. I feel much better now though.

So, I am a security Agent, which means, I make sure the planes are fit to fly, but I am also a costumer service agent. So I alternate between 2 uniforms.

Last week, I had my ""costumer service agent"" uniform on, which is a Tshirt dress in navy blue which goes down to my ankles. It is very modest and it's a little tighter at the waist, but it suits me well.

Cue an incredibly fat woman. When I say ""fat"" I really mean it, she couldn't walk for shit, she wobbled down in my direction. Sweat was breaking out on her forehead which turned a shade of piglet pink and her 7 chins wobbled in disgust.

I asked her if I could help her and she screamed at me ""HOW COME YOUR WHEELCHAIRS ARE THAT SMALL!?!?""

yes, we do have wheelchairservice available, but only for people who registered this service beforehand. The German red cross blessed us with that service, and if they know there are many passengers with disabilities, they prepare them right at the gate to basically grad them and dboard the disabled passengers safely.

This bitch just grabbed on of those wheelchairs and basically destroyed it. The wheels were *bent*.

It looked like it was straight out of a comic.

I asked her for her boarding pass to get her information and if I remember correctly, the GRC send her a bill for a brand mew wheelchair in the mail.

But how can you be so fucking full of yourself that you destroy something with your weight and not even have the decency to apologize? Most of these wheelchairs were bought with donation money.

fatpeoplestories,"Okay so I recently found this sub and now I have my own story to share.

I'm taking a break from college to do a 6 month apprenticeship at a very big company that might get me into my future dream job. However, I needed to move back in with my parents and sadly have to commute 2h every day to get there. I commute by train, hence the name.

You know how some people just always seem to have bad luck when it comes to who's sitting next/across to them? I'm one of them.

So I'm sitting in one of those 4 people seats (2 seats each facing each other with 2 people having to drive backwards) on a hella busy commute train in the middle of after work rush hour. 3 decent people are next to me. At a station, the literally heaviest man I have ever seen walks in with a backpack and a McDonald's takeaway bag. As soon as he enters, the whole train starts to smell horrible. He stops at my 4 people seat row and asks in a very broken voice if one of us could get up so he can sit down.

The guy sitting directly across from me gives up his seat and the heavy guy sits down, partially squeezing the poor girl in the window seat, who then quickly takes her chance to get up and change wagons, as we all should have done. The guy is already completey out of breath for simply having to walk a few steps. His head is red like a tomato. 

A lot of other people get in at the same station and the wagon fills up. There's too many people blocking the corridor now, so I just keep sitting. 

Next thing, the guy slams his backpack down on the freshly vacant seat and pulls out another 2 McDonald's takeaway bags. The feast begins. 

I kid you not, he gulped down 5 large burgers plus fries and nuggets on a 45 minute train ride. He ate like a literal pig, stuffing his face in them, barely chewing and not using a single napkin. He chews loudly and does not close his mouth, coughing and spitting while 'eating'. Burger sauce and grease gets everywhere. It runs down his hands, onto the seat and I even notice small sauce stains on my pant leg. The whole wagon smells like McDonalds and sweat. Everyone stares at him... Girl next to me and I earn a few short head shakes and 'I'm so sorry' stares from the surrounding passengers. He doesn't wipe his hands, he fucking LICKS the grease and sauce off of them. His head is even redder now.

Once he feasted on his 3000 calorie meal and washed it all down with some soda he just throws all of the wrappers, cardboard boxes and ketchup bags onto the vacant seat. Doesn't put them back in the takeaway bags, doesn't use the trash can that is literally in arm's reach of him. The seat looks like someone threw up on it, covered in burger stains and grease. 

While looking at him disgusted but also not being able to look away I remember thinking how much he looked like he was going to get a heart attack any minute. Head as red as it gets, greasy lips shining like plastic, sweat dripping all over him, 4+ chins and his shirt not even fully covering his massive belly. 

Needless to say, he leaned back in his seat, completely ignoring my leg space, squeezed his legs against mine, and instantly fell asleep. I stood up as soon as I could, went all the way to the back of the wagon and could hear his loud ass disgusting snores until I was finally able to get out at my station. He would wake up every other minute, start huffing and have a coughing fit and then just fall asleep again. 

I swear whenever I smell McDonald's I feel like throwing up because I get flashbacks of this guy. I don't hate him, I just feel sorry for this person for letting it even get to that point.",McDonald's feast on a train
fatpeoplestories,"Hi FPS, Red here with a HR Ham story to get you through your Monday sugar slump.

Last week the majority of my coworkers were at a conference in Vegas. I did not go, because *someone* has to work when nobody else is. J, however, did go, and when we arrived at our desks this morning she told me the following stories.

Ginny (being in HR) was in attendance. In the course of three days, she made an absolute pig of herself by:

1. Whining to the CEO's assistant (who planned the entire conference) that it was really unfair that none of the meals were buffets.

2. Trying to expense not one, *not two*, but **three** buffet meals. She was turned down, because meals were provided, and was apparently volubly angry about it.

3. Being caught with two gallon-sized Ziploc bags full of the pastries and quiches put out for refreshments. 

4. Loudly berating a hotel employee who had nothing to do with food service that there were not enough danishes.

5. Asking if there ""seconds"" or ""any extra entrees"" after a company lunch. When questioned by people at her table, she got upset and said the portions were too small. 

6. Annoying the people sitting in her immediate vicinity by a never ending cacophony of chip bag crinkling during meetings.

My boss then walked by and said that when he returned from some after-hours gambling at around 11pm, Ginny was sitting outside her door with her back against it eating her way through a full CVS bag of packaged powdered donuts with a bottle of vodka. She was presumably too drunk to be embarrassed and cheerfully informed him with a gooey messy full mouth that she was waiting for security because she locked herself out. 

I cannot tell if this is normal ham behavior or a downward spiral - Vegas makes a normal person crazy, it will make a crazy person crazier. Either way it's incredibly awkward and sad.

Roughly 4 months ago: START SCENE

Me and FBS have been getting our asses ran for the last 22 hours, and we finally make it back to the magical place that is our station to try and sleep. Stand up 24's suck the life out of you, and it should be no surprise that were both asleep before the head hits the pillow. Sweet, comatose death sleep. Were a double basic unit, and usually if we see the station after a long day, were there til end of shift because who the fuck does discharges at 3am? Assholes do. ANYWAYS. We fall blissfully into sleep... for about an hour. 45 mins left of our shift before relief comes in, we get silent dispatched a call (silent dispatch is where they don't come over the radio, we don't get the phone call on our phones, just the text message comes through. shit thing to do to an exhausted crew).

CALL:
M14-- IMMEDIATE RESPONSE
MICU-- OVERDOSE --PEDIATRIC BARIATRIC-- 13F
BIG HOSPITAL GOING TO EVEN BIGGER HOSPITALS PEDIATRIC UNIT
CALL NOTES: M30 LIFT ASSIST. BRING BARI STRETCHER. PT IS 670LBS.

Excuse me. What the actual fuck. So I call Creepy Uncle up in dispatch to make sure I'm understanding where were going, who's the lead on the call (were BLS not mICU so we are the lift assist) and to confirm that first, the age is correct, and second, the weight is correctly. 'Creepy Uncle, you sure this weight is right?' Yes. ""You sure this age is right?"" Yes. 'God damn, this is a big fucking bitch.' 'Basic Bitch Medic, remember you're on a recorded line. This is can be subpoenaed.' 'DUDE IDGAF THIS A BIG BITCH WHY YOU MAKING US LIFT HER' *click* CU hung up one me, whatever. I am NOT happy to be woken up for a lift assist... but I am mildly intrigued as the how this call is gonna play out. Ive never seen a pediatric bariatric before soooo there's that. Were en route, pick up the bari, and head out to big nice hospital. We find RQ and MM and are greeted with 'You fuckers ready to break your backs lifting a whale?' I love RQ.  Also of note, our bari stretcher is a piece of shit. No power lift, no power legs, completely manual and it likes to get jammed in place which is not ideal when youre holding up 670lbs of someone else pure fat.

So we go to make patient contact, and I peak in the room slightly. I see someone, roughly 400lbs, sitting on the bed and breathe a sigh of relief. Okay cool, 400lbs between 4 people is totally doable. I aint even mad anymore. *Then the bathroom door opens* and out rolls this Giant Fucking Snorlax blocking the road. 670 lbs. Got 3 hospital gowns on, how? No clue. She is wider than she is tall... and she's a CHILD. That hurts my heart writing it. Looking closer, person on the bed is her mother. 400lb mom, 670lb kid, this shits making sense now. RQ starts getting report from the nurse, patient attempted suicide via overdose... with 8 Ibuprofen pills. *8 IBUPROFEN PILLS*. Even in a normal size person, that's gonna make your kidneys hurt a bit and thats it... like shit I take that much in a day when I have a migraine. 670lbs of mass can tolerate a lot higher doses of medication, so we at least know she's safe from actively dying in our truck and its not like we gotta Narcan anyone this morning. TLDR: This call is a waste of god damn time medically but because she did it intended to harm herself, she's gotta go to the children's hospital both for eval and psych holding. We get our signatures, have her walk (!!!!!) over the stretcher and sit down. ""Whys the stretcher gotta be so big?""  Do not test me right now little girl. ""Its to make you more comfortable.""

With the help of 3 nurses (8 people total) we get the stretcher up to pushing height. Push the stretcher out to the truck, feeling to Syphisus with his god damn rock going up the hill, and start preparing to load. Due to the dynamics of the ambulance, we can't have 8 people. Part behind the patients head is obstructed by the ambulance and has to move backwards. Also, our company doesnt have bari ambulance with the ramps and joists and shit so... fuck our spines, ya know? RQ, MM, FBS and Me all take corners and get ready to life, with Slim Jim operating the legs. SJ smashes his finger in the process, a true hero. Were loaded, and even though its not my call, I decide to ride along in back with RQ and let FBS drive our ambulance by himself to the second hospital. RQ start her assessment which is mostly asking why she wanted to harm herself, what's going on in her life. ""I want to die because I hate being so fat"" Big Momma pipes in 'Youre a growing girl! You need plenty to eat to grow up big and strong!' LADY THAT AINT AN ISSUE HERE K? ""I don't have friends because I cant leave the house, Im too big to fit through the door easily"" 'Baby you can get all the exercise you need inside, and you can make friends on the internet' *Cue 30 minutes more of daughter voicing valid concerns about how she doesn't like her size, she wants to change, and mom interjecting about why she should change* Fast forward to receiving hospital. We unload daughter without any incident, for once the bari stretcher isn't trying to *striaght up murder us*. Then comes Mom's turn to exist the truck. She cant ambulate down the two stairs, its too high for her. Even with us assisting her out, she still manages to trip over her own feet and tumble 2 feet onto the pavement. Thank god for the rider release form!

We ended up filling a CPS report on that one, because Moms literally killing her daughter with her own BS fat logic. feeding her kid to death. Linked back up with FBS for EOS and he looks at me ""I'm making an appointment to get me lap-band retightened. That made the choice for me.' Good for you FBS. RQ and MM light up a smoke, completely shell shocked, just glad thats over with. RQ: Im going the fuck home to go to sleep. Then I'm going for a run because... nope. MM: takes deep drag, who wants Katzs? We proceed to clear shift and tell Creepy Uncle that were getting some breakfast quick before crew change because **we deserve some bagels and shit after lifting 670lbs and working up an appetite**

END SCENE

TLDR: If your kid reaches 670lbs, maybe don't keep over feeding them so they can 'grow up big and strong'. Also, don't make 8 people lift you because [my back hurts](https://i.redd.it/bybu8ra142r11.jpg)

fatpeoplestories,"You guys want more I'll give you more.

It had been a few weeks since the food pantry incedent and I for the most part had been giving WRE the silent treatment. Normally no noise in our room other than what our electronic make. 

Until one day WRE spoke up and told me he felt depressed and wanted to die. I took pity on him because I have MDD with suicidal thoughts. So I told him to go to the student clinic and set up an appointment with someone. I recommend my doctor because she always explained things simply to me and listens to me and my concerns and is just all around a great doctor.

He agreed and claims he set up an appointment, then he asked me if I could help him get a girlfriend. I told him if he wanted to be in a relationship with someone he was going to need to do a lot of work on himself. He agreed, I was pleasantly surprised. 

He asked me to help him lose weight and help him learn to talk to girls and asked if we could be friends because he didn't have any. So being the eternal optimist that I am agreed to help him and be his friend. The first thing I told him to do was start to shower EVERYDAY. He started on how he thought women like a man's natural musk, my exact words where ""No women like a man who doesn't smell like pickled ass and smegma."" He tells me he doesn't have any soap so I give him a new bar and he goes showers. Progress.

He comes back and he's actually clean and in clean clothes. I tell him I'm going to the gym the next morning and would be willing to train him if he wanted he says he doesn't have anything to wear to the gym, so I take him to Goodwill and we grab him a few outfits. And go to the gym the next day. He struggles with the lowest weights on all the machines but I encouraged him to keep going and we make it through the workout.

I tell him to download MyFitnessPal and to quit eating crap and I give him a whole lesson on nutrition. A week goes by he says he's sticking to his eating plan and went to the gym everyday that week. I told him I was proud of him and asked him if he wanted to weight himself on my scale. Well ladies and lads he put on twelve pounds.

I asked him how he put on weight instead of losing it and said he did just what the app said and ate 1800 calories per meal. What da fuc. He thought that his calories a day was his calories per meal. He had been eating 5400 calories a day.

He got mad and said I lied to him and that I set him up to fail because there's no way a man can live on only 1800 calories a day (despite I've been eating 1500 for months at that point). He says he hates the gym and that he doesn't smell like a man with my soap I gave him and that it must be womens soap because girls wouldn't talk to him. And he said the doctor I sent him to was a quack because she said the same thing I told him to do, and then went on some bizarre rant about how women shouldn't be doctors.

fatpeoplestories,"For background, refer to my post yesterday about Jeff and Amy.

This is gonna be a quick one, because I've got class coming up in a bitsy, but here goes:

The thing about Amy is that she gets very angry very quickly about lots of things. Indeed, I spent most of my time at my dad's (before she left, but that's another story) pretty much walking on eggshells for fear of setting her off.

But sometimes, I'd say something that I didn't intend to be offensive, and it would still send her flying into a rage. One such time was back in the bright and sunny days of 2015, when my friend and I were in an entry-level bio course. I often had him over for dinner at my dad's, but tonight was going to be special.

My friend and I had learned about ATP synthesis that day in bio class, and we both found it very interesting. But as he, my dad (who wasn't so crazy in those days) and I all talked about it over our meal of an interesting attempt at meatloaf, Amy began showing her signs of dinner-rage: forks and knives scraping heavily on her plate and heavy breathing. She started getting pretty mad, and I said something along the lines of: ""Miss Amy, we're just talking about ATP synthase!""

Her response before storming off to her and my dad's room was short, but killer: ""ATP SYNTHASE IS FAKE! IT'S ALL FAKE!!!""",Some crazy shit

Introducing one new character:

&amp;#x200B;

QueenOfTheWest: Senior scientist in our group. Spends more of her time in meetings than anything else (much to her chagrin) and generally a cool person. Doesn't get along with KingOfTheSouth because he expects her to do his job for him, and would probably be the main heroine in my /r/TalesOfMike submissions if I posted there more often.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, NewManager scheduled a planning meeting to figure out who would be doing what for the next year or so. He also brought pizza + soda to make up for how long &amp; boring these sessions tend to be. We all get our two slices + cup of beetus juice &amp; settle in for a miserable 2-plus hours. KingOfTheSouth, surprisingly, doesn't grab either.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

NewManager: KingOfTheSouth, you don't want pizza?

&amp;#x200B;

QueenOfTheWest: It's like I don't know who you are anymore!

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: Not if I can only have two pieces! It's not worth eating unless I can have a feast (I swear that ""feast"" was his word)! That's why I only have a bit of fruit for lunch!

&amp;#x200B;

Me: YeahSureWhatever.gif

&amp;#x200B;

\[aside: ""It's not worth eating unless I can eat ALL the food"" sounds.... pretty demented at least to me. Especially when it's resulted in KotS ~~weighing 250-300 lbs~~ being a real American.\]

&amp;#x200B;

NewManager: ....Sure, I think that's prudent.

&amp;#x200B;

QueenOfTheWest brings up the planning spreadsheet &amp; starts assigning pending work items. Eventually we get to me, and we quickly sort everything out. KingOfTheSouth then decides to chime in, saying I had agreed to do some work for a customer he was supporting (read: that he'd bullied me into agreeing to do).

&amp;#x200B;

QueenOfTheWest: Do you have a work request for it?

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: No, but....

&amp;#x200B;

QueenOfTheWest: Do you know when they'll get one to you?

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: No, but......

&amp;#x200B;

QueenOfTheWest: Do you even know how much time it'll take to complete?

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: No, but....

&amp;#x200B;

QueenOfTheWest: Do they even have a rough idea of what it'll look like?

&amp;#x200B;

QueenOfTheWest (obviously annoyed, obviously thinks KingOfTheSouth is an idiot): Anyways, moving on.....

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth was visibly deflated and hurt after this exchange. Who would have thought that ""Someone might request an unspecified amount and type of work some time this year"" was too vague a request? Or that QueenOfTheWest wouldn't pull me off an overdue commitment to work on it?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, this meeting was in January..... I'm posting this in April and they still haven't gotten to KingOfTheSouth with the work request! It's almost like he was making shit up to seem more important/harass people he doesn't like.

fatpeoplestories,"Well since it seems like a lot of people liked my first story let's continue.

When WRE wasn't actively being a creepy homophobic bitch he was busy being a pig. And by pig I mean the large animal that grunts eats all day and wallow in their own filth.

So after the events of our first story he got chewed out by our RA, my Girlfriend and myself where he proceeded to cry and beg our forgiveness. Seeing how there was no way out of my housing contract I tried to make peace with WRE on the condition he treats my girlfriend, my self and my property with respect. He agrees.

There's a food pantry on campus students are encouraged to use I would go once every two weeks to get some snacks and powdered milk to mix my protein powder with. Now we're only supposed to go once a week, but with the amount of food your allowed to take you could feed two people for a week.

I tell WRE about the place and he expressed interest so I told him where to go. He comes back with a shit ton of food enough for a family of four. Now there's a shelf with expired but still good food that counts as a ""free item"" so you can take as many as you want along with the regular amount. So I figured he just went hog wild on that shelf (pun intended).

He puts his food still in the bags on the floor and leaves it there creating a tripping hazard. He didn't get any good food all caned crap and poptarts and noodles. So the entire time he's in the room he just eats. Wrappers and cans pile up the room starts to smell like spoiled food but he doesn't clean no matter how much I try.

He goes again the next week and  comes back with enough food for a family of four, and since I was out of powdered milk I went in the afternoon. I go later in the day then he does, type my ID number into the computer and it gives me an error code saying that I have maxed out my item allotment for the week. I talk to the volunteer at the desk and she says I can have some of the stuff off the expired shelf but that's all she could do. 

It's weird I guessed that it was just a glitch or something, and went back the next week same thing. I ask if they can see when my number was used and they said the day before. The day WRE went to the pantry. It starts to click and I pull up a picture of my roommate and ask her if she's seen him around and she says he and his twin brother come every week. He doesn't have a brother, he's a only child. I thank her and leave.

At this point everything has clicked into place and I know WRE must have gotten my I'd card when I was in the shower or something and wrote down my number and was going to the food pantry as himself then as his ""twin"". I confronted him and he starts yelling and accusing me of slandering his ""good"" name and that he was a gentleman not a theif. 

So the next week I go Monday waiting at the door when they open my number goes through this time no problem. Get food and hide it away in my girlfriends dorm and pretend like nothing happened. I offered him a ride to the pantry since I knew it was going to rain and it was a a long walk or a long bus ride to the pantry, he didn't want to accept at first but I eventually convinced him.

He goes and I walk in with him and the volunteer ( who is in one of my classes and I asked her to do this) at the desk asked him how his brother was doing. He stumbled a bit and said his brother was good, I say ""but wait WRE you'r an only child"". He's knows he's busted he says nothing get his food (half the amount he normally gets) and I drive us back. I confronted him again and he breaks and started crying again begging for forgiveness. I called the food pantry and told them his scam, he has been banned for one year.

fatpeoplestories,"So this is my first post on r/fatpeoplestories, so I'm sorry if it isn't formatted great.

Before I turned 18, I lived half of the time with my dad and his girlfriend. For privacy's sake, we'll call my dad Jeff, and his girlfriend Amy. For some background, Amy and my dad are both stellar people, with my dad having turned into a hardcore antivaxxer since losing his job, and Amy being a stupid, borderline-psychotic bitch. Amy is also a hamplanet, about 5'2"" and weighing in at 300 lb. at her max, who was unable to walk fifty feet without breaking a sweat and who spent most of her days lying in bed on Facebook.

But on to the main story. It was a fine, warm day in the spring of 2015, and while my brother and I were sitting in our dad's living room playing Goat Simulator, we noticed a... smell.

It was the eyewateringly putrid scent of rancid butter, mixed with the tiniest hint of a florid sweetness that I now know probably came from Amy's years of barely-treated type II diabetes. We searched through the house for the source of the smell, at first thinking that something in the fridge was rotten or that one of the dozens of cans that Amy and my dad kept in their garage (along with the rest of their hoard) had gone bad. You know, what counted for ""normal stuff"" in my life there.

But when we got to my dad and Amy's bedroom and the stink was so bad we knew we would soon have to leave our house, we realized with dawning horror that there was only one explanation. I poked my head into the bedroom, where Amy was lying on her bed surrounded by a cloud of stench, scrolling through Facebook on her computer.

""Miss Amy,"" I asked politely -- even though I was in high school, my dad still forced me to call her Miss -- ""what's that smell?""

She laughed, a sickeningly sweet sound that still gives me goosebumps whenever I hear it. ""Oh, that?"" she said primly. ""That's just my armpit. Tee-hee.""

ARMPIT. SINGULAR.

My brother and I ran outside to get away from the stench, and once we were in the clear we damn near pissed ourselves laughing.

I have so many stories about my life with Amy and my dad... let me know if you want to hear any more of them.",Hamplanet clears out a house
fatpeoplestories,"This happened back in 2007. 

At the time, I was a 5'6"", 110 pound teenage girl flying from Denver to Seattle. I've never been the most social creature, so I'd been listening to my ipod ever since getting through security and ignoring everyone and everything around me. Anyways, bording time came shortly after I reached my gate, and I was actually looking forward to the flight because I had a window seat. So I stowed my carry-on, took my seat, fastened my seatbelt, etc. 

A few minutes later, the second person in my row arrived. He was average height, average weight, early 50's. To my relief, he had both the aisle seat and a book. I doubted he would be the chatty type.

Another ten minutes or so went by, and I was starting to think the seat between Average Dude and I would remain empty. But then my hopes were shattered by the arrival of Airplane Ham. This woman was easily 300lbs, and seemed to carry most of her weight in her belly and her arms. I didn't think she would fit in the seat between AD and I, but to my surprise, she managed to squeeze in. Her arm fat was spilling into my personal space a bit, but it wasn't anything I couldn't avoid by leaning against the window, so I didn't say anything.

Finally, everyone's on board and in their seats. The flight attendants were going around telling everyone to fasten their seatbelts and turn their electronics off, and Airplane Ham was looking a bit suspicious. She had a blanket covering her lower half, her backpack pressed firmly against her belly, and was very obviously pretending to be asleep. Which is fine, but she was clinging to that backpack like it was full of diamonds and kept opening her eyes a fraction to squint down the aisle. As soon as the flight attendant approached our row, AH squeezed her eyes shut and started making these weird snuffling grunts that I think were supposed to be snores.

So here's a quick snapshot of the scene:

Average Dude is in slacks and a dress shirt, reading his book, seatbelt clearly visible and fastened.

I'm still listening to my ipod, the fabric from my oversized hoodie covering the seatbelt.

Airplane Ham is grunting in her fake slumber, her waist covered by both a blanket and her bag. 

Everything was fine.

But then the flight attendant asked the Hambeast if her seatbelt was fastened. She didn't reply, but she stopped the grunting noises and screwed her face in an exaggerated grimace, obviously ignoring him. So he asked again. This time, Airplane Ham gave up on the sleep act.

Airplane Ham: YES, my seatbelt is fastened! I'm trying to sleep!

Flight Attendant: I'm sorry, if I could just check--

At this, Airplane Ham completely lost her shit. She started screaming about how the flight attendant was harassing her and unfairly singling her out because of her size. She wouldn't let him get a word in edgewise, so he scurried off to get backup.

When he returned with another flight attendant, she lost her shit again, this time complaining about how flight attendant #1 had only asked to see her seatbelt, and not mine or Average Dude's. I wordlessly pulled on my hoodie to show that my seatbelt was fastened, hoping that would shut her up.

It didn't.

She continued screaming, saying it wasn't her fault that the seatbelts were too small, and that it was wrong for the airlines to purposely make it so airplanes were only accessible to ""little sluts like her"". She jiggled her arm fat in my general direction.

She was escorted off the plane shortly after that. Unsurprisingly, her seatbelt wasn't fastened. And to think all this could have been avoided if she'd just asked for a fucking seatbelt extender. ",Airplane Ham

fatpeoplestories,"About a week ago, my friend (5’2”, 250lbs) and I (5’, 100 lbs) went out to get pizza. I was famished and starving since all I had for lunch was a small bowl of salad and rice.

We order our pizza and I start going ham on it. My slices just disappear by the second because 1) the pizza is fucking delicious and 2) I’m fucking starving.

Friend starts spewing fat logic. Some memorable quotes include:

“Oh my god you ate that so fast! Why are you so much skinnier than me??”

(How fast you eat does not make you gain wait faster, but I digress. It can cause you to overeat, but I’m careful).


“You literally ate three slices already. I don’t understand why you’re so tiny. I eat one slice and I balloon up.”

“My metabolism just sucks I guess, unlike yours.”

Keep in mind she doesn’t know that I count my calories. I do my best to stay under 2000 a day, and I don’t eat breakfast (except coffee of course). I eat an extremely small and healthy lunch so I can spoil myself later.

Meanwhile, I’ll get snaps from her chugging half a carton of chocolate milk or eating fast food in between classes.

fatpeoplestories,"As you may remember, I'm a skinny chick who manages a gym.  We switched software and it's been a slow learning curve for all.

I was frustrated for the 20th time this week, working on the check-in computer, helping two members who had a problem checking in.

Along comes Audrey.  She was part of the ""old fat lady"" group a few months ago who made fun of my skinny legs as I stood center in their exercise class circle consulting with my co-worker.  Like gang-bullied.

Already frustrated, I just ignored Audrey.  She had just arrived and hadn't even taken off her jacket.  A usual ""hello"" is given once they're on their way into the gym to actually exercise.

But no.  She walked straight up to me and the two male members I was assisting.  She touched my shoulder so as to have me turn my attention to her and she said, ""Look at her legs!  I mean, it would take four of hers just to make one of mine! hahahaahaa!""

Without even looking up at her, I said, ""Shut up, Audrey.""

fatpeoplestories,"I'm a 5'3 110 lb female and my sister is about 5'7 and possibly 200+ lbs.  I'm still in high school and she's in college.

My sister has always struggled with her weight and I've been sympathetic and encouraging with her to a fault. But, she always makes some kind of weird comment on my body, face, makeup.. ect 

For example, if I forgot to put on concealer one day, she will ruthlessly make comments on my pores (which she knows I'm insecure about) or if my eyebrows look weird that day she HAS to point it out.

 A big insecurity of mine is my nose, and oftentimes she'll tell me how good i look in a lighting and I *must* let her take a picture. Well, I comply and then she shows me the picture and almost always says ""Aw, you look good but your nose ruins the picture"" then promptly deletes it without waiting for my opinion? 

Well one day, we were out for a walk and once again she tells me to stop so she can take a picture of me, but now I'm sick of her critiquing me so I refuse, but she insists. I relent and let her take it. Then she shows me the picture and fucking says ""Your boobs look too saggy here"". My boobs have never been saggy so I have no idea wtf she's seeing? But she's always complained to me about how hers are too small and that she envies mine.

I take offense to that and she flips out, saying I'm so defensive and how I can't take a joke!! 
I tell her how I can make all kinds of comments about her and point out her flaws but I don't because it's mean, and then she literally says ""But it's the truth and it's fun"" in a joking tone but I can definitely tell that's how she really feels.

She tries to pick me up ""playfully"" then tells me how heavy I've gotten (I've been the same weight all throughout middle and high school). 

Sorry for the rant, but has anyone else dealt with this kind of stuff? 

UPDATE: thank you to everyone for all the advice and my first silver (:  However, I DID get some revenge today. My sister began her mantra again, saying how cute I'd look if I got my nose done, well I snapped back and said ""You'd look so cute if you lost some weight"". She got super offended (ofc) and said how I didn't need to go there, so I simply told her how *she* went there first

fatpeoplestories,"Hey r/fatpeoplestories this is my first time posting, so I thought I'd exploit the bullshit I'm dealing with for a cheap laugh for everyone on here.

&amp;#x200B;

For some context - we are all basically grad students at the same university so 21-24 years old. We're all, for the most part, pretty athletic as that's how we met one another. Here's a who's who:

* Me (Bartok), I'm an elite athlete, around 5'5"" and 155lbs, I look a bit [like this](https://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-55185-body-shape.htm?StartAt=1#.XKDqZkRKiqQ) (but with a little more body fat) bc I am a competitive weightlifter.
* My GF (Liz), also elite athlete, 5'10"" and 168lbs, she looks [like this](https://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-35513-body-shape.htm?StartAt=19#.XKDrwkRKiqQ). Liszt can eat like nobody's business and has Polycystic Ovaries which makes gaining weight easy.
* Babe, who is doing a professional masters degree. She's 5'2"", 210lbs and looks [like this](https://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-55617-body-shape.htm?StartAt=2#.XKDsRkRKiqQ). She has a problem with eating all of my food.
* My 2 other roommates are Dirk (a 5'7"" guy who plays ice hockey) and Mark (a 5'10"" guy who used to play football).

&amp;#x200B;

Money is tight for me right now and we all live in an expensive city, so I'm trying to balance a pretty big caloric intake with living on about $130 a week for transport, bills, food etc. It's doable but I owe a friend money so I'm saving whatever I can which means I've not got a whole lot of disposable income. Babe, on the other hand, is getting $15,000 a year from the government as a bursary so she's not exactly scratching around for pennies. For example, she bought herself a nice new fitbit (ha) that she wears 24/7. It would be one thing to have my food being eaten by a roommate, but it's another thing entirely for it to be eaten by my roommate WHO GETS GIVEN FREE GOVERNMENT MONEY.

&amp;#x200B;

All of us have noticed Babe's habit of 'going shopping' in other peoples cupboards. The catch is, Babe is so completely blasé that you either don't notice it's not her butter/bread/milk/cheese etc. or you assume she's allowed to do it because she's just going about it like it's the most normal thing in the world. Dirk has taken to buying bread Babe doesn't like and Mark has just written his name on everything in permanent marker complete with degree titles and honourifics (as in Mr. Mark Markson, BSc, MSc, PhD, ClinPsyD etc. etc.) just to hammer home the point. 

&amp;#x200B;

It started with condiments. I would buy mayonnaise and a 1kg jar would vanish within a week. Same for ketchup and bbq sauce - gone overnight. The assumption was people probably didn't realise how much they were using... until we observed Babe's condiment habits. This woman is physically incapable of eating without slathering her dinner in mayonnaise, ketchup or both. So me, Dirk and Mark decided we'd buy our own condiments and start drawing lines to mark useage and, behold, Babe was ketchup and mayo free. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then came the cheese. Liz loves cheese, she loves cheese more than me. Her raison d'etre is cheese. Babe also loves cheese, so much so that she was willing to go into my shelf in the fridge, pull out Liz's bag of shredded mozzarella, liberally coat her pulled pork burger in about 100g of it which finished the bag, PUT THE BAG IN THE BIN, and proceed to chow down. In front of Liz, who proceeded to ask Babe wtf she thought she was doing and chew her out over the cheese. From this moment, Babe has been increasingly unpleasant to Liz (who I assume she hates because Liz is ... tall and slim despite having an actual condition that makes you gain weight...) all because she was called out for oinking down someone else's cheese.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the current drama is over my protein powder. I'm switching positions in my sport and I need 'cultivate mass' as it were. Now, I love eating, but I can't physically afford to eat this much so I try and help myself along with mass gainer, (fake) milk and protein shakes after training. I can't really deal with loads of lactose so I try and have vegan protein powder which, if you've had it, you'll know is gritty and a bit gross. You'll also know it's relatively expensive but should also last a fair while. At the same time, Babe - who is revelling in my attempts to get fat - has decided to spend her sweet sweet bursary money on exercise gear she wears round the house (despite being unable to walk up a flight of stairs without breaking a sweat) and expensive running shoes. Whilst I've been away at Liz's recovering from a broken eye socket I got playing sports, it appears Babe has been helping herself to my vegan protein powder. I managed to discover this when I went to make myself a shake and *someone* had kindly left me less than a scoop of powder left despite the container being 1/3 full a week ago. I sent a photo of the sad dregs of my protein (which I know for a fact neither Dirk nor Mark will touch, because it's disgusting) to the group chat, but apparently Babe has never even seen this massive 2kg tub of protein before and is, frankly, distraught that someone would take it. Unfortunately, she's not exactly Meryl Streep.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway this is incredibly long and I'm currently discussing whether or not to invest in lactulose to put in my milk for some sweet revenge. Hopefully Babe will take my protein-less rage as a warning and not continue to gobble my food.",My roommate is seemingly unable to stop herself from eating my food

fatpeoplestories,"So we have these turnstiles at work that are basically two pieces of plastic that open and close sorta like the Star Trek doors when you badge. They're about waist high but you can't just walk through them. Well that's what I thought until I witnessed an impatient piggy waiting to get to the trough she calls lunch.

She has the legs of Squidward when he ate all those Krabby Patties. Like she's got a moderate gut but her visceral fat is dwarfed by the fatty legs she has. Like she waddles in the weirdest way because her legs are easily my torso size, naw fuck that, it's like 1.5 times bigger. What makes it worse is that she wears these spandex high water/culottes things so you see every pit of her cottage cheese legs.

So she forgot her badge and I'm trying to tell her to go get it so she can get out and that she is supposed to wear it at all times.

She of course ignores me and does something I didn't think was even possible. She somehow squeezes herself in Terminator 2 style through these two portions and the sheer force of the fat pushes the things into their little slots. That alone would be impressive but the SPEED in which she did it was what blew my mind. I didn't have time to react as she poured through it and just stared like Dr. Silberman.

One time when I was staying at her house, my mother knocked on my door asking if she'd taken one of my jackets by mistake. I walked up and opened the door. Here she was with this jacket she'd had for years--it was clearly hers--but she couldn't fit into it. I told her it wasn't mine; that she'd owned that for a while; but she didn't believe me.

So I was shopping at a local mall looking for some gloves and a hat. I saw a hallway kiosk was found out of business and everything was on sale and they had hats! Stopped to get some winter gear and the ladies kept trying to upsell me on everything else I didn’t need.

fatpeoplestories,"I shared [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/a0r1oc/when_doctors_wont_tell_you_that_being_fat_is_the/) a few months ago, discussing how my doctors refused to tell me that certain health issues were the direct result of obesity. I just learned today that some doctors refused to tell me I had health issues at all.

My hospital allows patients to log onto their network and look at things like upcoming appointments and test results, and I went picking through my test history for shits and giggles. I looked at an abdominal CT pathology report from the very beginning of 2013 that said my liver was fatty and my gallbladder was potentially sludgy. The CT wasn't due to liver concerns, but it still found some.

So I had a fatty liver for at least six damn years and *no one* told me. At the time, my liver enzymes were normal too, so I had absolutely no idea. Seriously, WTF is with doctors and not telling their patients they have conditions caused by their weight? I know fatty liver disease isn't a death sentence, but it's a reversible condition. The attending physician was a relative of mine too, so I figured she could at least be straight with me. I don't drink either, so it was definitely due to my size.

fatpeoplestories,"Hi FPS, Red here at the behest of u/ProspectDikadu, who asked if there were any updates on Ginny. 

I'm sure many of you are familiar with the constant stream of pastries that seem to appear in office break rooms, and my break room at work is no different. If it's not Girl Scout Cookies, it's a cake from a party someone threw, or a batch of cupcakes from a vendor, or danishes from the sales meeting, or whatever. 

Tuesday, it happened to be donuts. Not from Krispy Kreme, and not even from the local donut dive. *These* were from Fancy Doughnut Shoppe That Spells Out Doughnut and Shoppe with Two P's. Each donut is approximately the size of my head, and garnished with such culinary madness as maple frosting with bacon, or chocolate and chili, or Froot Loop frosting. They are so big that a baker's dozen fits in *two* boxes, not one.

It also happened to be a coworker's birthday (we'll call him Junior). Junior was given a beautiful chocolate cake for the occasion, and happily passed out pieces to whoever happened to be in the kitchen at that moment. The cake was from a very popular bakery, so it was gone almost immediately. (Yes, I ate cake for lunch, it was delicious, fight me.) Most everyone had filtered out when Ginny arrived, slightly out of breath.

&gt;Where's the cake?

Someone pointed at the remnants, still sitting on the counter.

&gt;Someone brought it for Junior's birthday.

&gt;And nobody saved a piece?!

Ginny said this so loudly and aggressively, the few people in the room stopped their conversations and stared. She turned pink and rushed out.

Approximately 10 minutes later I passed through the break room with my arms full of papers. Ginny was standing over the boxes of donuts, staring.

I need impress upon you the sort of staring I mean. I don't mean the casual perusal one does when they're trying to choose the best option. I mean the kind of staring the creepy guy in your college literature class who wrote you slightly deranged poems with a lot of alliteration that tied the two of you to a covenant of undying love, and probably still drives by the house you used to live in used to do. That kind of staring.

When I walked in it took her a moment to snap out of it. She glared at me and turned her back on the donuts. I ignored her, passed by and exited through the far door. 

Outside the far door is the copy machine, which was my destination. I can only guess that Ginny thought that I had gone back to my desk, because mere moments later the door swung open and there she stood with a large salad bowl loosely covered by a paper napkin. 

A large salad bowl, *filled to the brim with donuts*, covered by a paper napkin.

FACE SIZED DONUTS. IN A SALAD BOWL.

I have never seen someone look so trapped in my life, and I'm not going to lie I was a little spooked. Ginny looked absolutely furious and incredibly guilty. 

Guys, I had no idea what to do... so I pretended I didn't see. I said, ""Oops, dropped a paperclip - sorry, excuse me!"" bent down to get the non-existent paperclip, and then stepped out of the way. Don't ask me why that was my bob and weave, I don't have a fucking clue. Randomburst_politeness.exe kicked in because I legit had nothing else.

Ginny *ran* past me. The man that sits close to the printer (I don't know him) and I shared a look of astonishment - I have no idea if he saw the donut salad or if he was just startled by the sudden rhino stampede. I went to the kitchen to make tea and saw one of the donut boxes in the trash, and the other half full.

I avoid going past her desk so I have no idea if she ate all of them or took some home, but the salad bowl was sitting empty and smeared with frosting in the sink at the end of the day. But assuming one or two had already been taken by the time she got to them, Ginny had eaten or planned to eat *at least* six absolutely *massive* donuts.

fatpeoplestories,"The last time I complained about my medium ham sister with all her excuses, I had a lot of nice comments. I also had some hate from y'all.  Same thing when I complain about my Planet Jupiter of a mom (who I love dearly) who has the Betus, and is married to my dad who is ""pre Betus"".

To prove I listen to all comments, evaluate and learn, I decided to deliberately do an experiment this morning and the results are in.

Background:  I did the 23 N me DNA test this winter.  My sister did not, but she asked me to share my results since our DNA is from the same two parents.  This morning, I got an email from 23 with the title, ""See what your DNA reveals about your Type II Diabetes risk"".  It's 27%. Then it offered a 3 question quiz.  I entered my age and weight/height.  I exaggerated my fast food intake at 3-4 times per week.  I accurately stated that I work out 5-7 times a week (I'm a fitness instructor/personal trainer at a gym).  The results were I'm actually at a less than 1% risk.

So, knowing my sister is in yoga, boot camp and ice hockey, walks her dog 5 miles a week on top of that, but she over eats, I decided to send her an encouraging text this morning.  I took a screen shot of my DNA quiz and it's results.  I wrote to her, ""Because of diet and exercise, I'm at less than 1% risk.  Another motivator for you to keep rocking your fitness journey outta the park!""

The reply is evidence of my experiment.  Let's see how she responds to a clear statement of her risk of getting the Betus, and a clear statement that I think she's an awesome athlete.

Her response?  4 texts about yoga with no regard to my text content.  So I answered her yoga question.  She replied with excuses why she could not do what I suggested (which was about the cost of yoga classes and I suggested You Tube).  Then she complained she's running out of time during the week to do all these classes.  She works at a school so I told her Summer is almost here.  Then she came up with more excuses to her own original complaint about the cost and time it takes for her to exercise.  Legit reasons, actually.  But the excuse for her not to have more time this summer was this.  ""Boat season."" And what they do is grill giant amounts of food, get completely drunk and sit around on the dock with their dock mates after they sat around in the boat all day drinking and eating.

huh.

A ton more back and forth texts of her excuses and my encouraging ideas of solutions, she said, ""And Dad has been pre-diabetic for like 5 years..."" as a rebuttal to, honestly, idk what.  My dad is thin, but never exercises and eats what Jupiter makes him for the past 68 years.

It was then she finally addressed my original text in content.  She wrote, ""So you think we're good on the diabetes thing?""

I wrote back, ""My entire point was to acknowledge all that you do at the gym and encourage you to keep going.""

Her response, ""Oh!  Thanks!  I thought you were worried about being diabetic.""

So I said, ""No!  I'm not worried about ME.  I was encouraging you to keep up the good job so YOU don't become diabetic.""

And she said, ""I've known for a long time what to do so I don't end up like Ma.""

Yet, she still doesn't put the fork down.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Tl;DR  My sister was resistant to encouragement and filled my morning with an hour of excuses while still complaining that she's spending too much time and money at the gym.  When all she had to text back to me was either nothing, or a simple acknowledgement that I shared my DNA results like she had asked me to.

EDITED to add - I forgot that I deleted my previous post because some of y'all were getting nasty and you hurt my feelings.  ","The saga with my sister continues. Hams, this could be triggering, so be nice this time."

He would judge me for having friends who weren't white, was generally disgusting towards people who were mixed and made his distaste towards black people with darker skin known. He uses anything as an excuse for his awful life decisions, POC being one of the many. 

Now, he lives in a flat being paid for by disability benefits. His umbilical cord wrapped around his hand when he was a baby and his hand was fused into a fist, so he claims a lot of welfare benefits for that. It doesn't really impede his daily life and it certainly didn't stop him from stealing our Christmas money so he could buy drugs and food for himself or working on the side but alas...

Outside this ground floor apartment he lives in, there's a large green cupboard outside the door to store shoes and stuff. This is where the man who lives in the cupboard into this. We'll call the man Bandersnatch as according to my brother's account he looks like Stefan from Bandersnatch except really grizzly, toothless and piss scented. 


So Bandersnatch's Mother had died and he was left without a home, so my Dad, ever so generous and benevolent had set up a compromise; Bandersnatch was to make him food,make him coffee, roll his joints and collect his drugs in exchange for a place...In his cupboard. 

And he fucking took it up.  

The entire time my brother stayed at my Dad's flat he was just sat there watching in some suspended awe as they went through multiple packs of microwaveable crepes. There was maple syrup stockpiled in the damn kitchen cupboards and they proudly professed that the crepes were the only thing they could eat with their teeth. Bandersnatch would hobble out of his cupboard every so often and bring him cups of coffee in this giant fuck off sports direct mug. He's notorious for having too much sugar in his coffee in these giant mugs and he went through about 5 a day. 

This isn't even that much of a surprise to us, the Bastard's a sketchy cunt and the man living in the cupboard seems almost comedic in comparison to his exploits. I suppose having a house elf live in your cupboard to cater to your every hammy whim is next level, though. 

Maybe I'll tell you some more about it? I'm unsure! Idk I don't know whether this would qualify but ah well!",Hamily Ties: The Beginning
fatpeoplestories,"Someone asked me for more Ham Beast stories, this occurred a few months ago. So we have weekly meetings, each shift does. This is to go over any concerns the charge nurse has, policies, etc. This particular week the powers that be gave my boss permission to order pizzas. 

However the pizzeria we ordered from was behind due to a multitude of orders so we had our meeting first. My boss said she would let us know when the pizza was delivered and to get back to our patients. 

Anyway I was busy when I was told the pizza was delivered and my boss told me not to worry they would save me two slices. An hour later I am finally able to get away to the breakroom where I see Ham beast guiltily looking down and two of my coworkers raising their voices.

Me: whats going on?

CW 1: They ordered two large pizzas for us which would have been enough but HB ate an entire large pizza herself!

HB: -lips trembling - you guys are so tiny, you only eat one piece of pizza each and so do boss and CW 3, I have hyperglycemia I need more fuel.

CW2 (starts cursing in Tagalog, the majority of my cw’s are from the Philippines. So is my mom so I am fluent) says no your just fat (in Tagalog)

CW1 laughs, I try not to laugh and HB bursts into tears and bursts out of the room. 

I tell the ladies to have at the pizza as I had brought hot pockets with me in case there was not enough (I am a big dude 2 slices do not cut it)
We are sitting there when Boss (charge nurse) comes in...

She sits down sighing
Boss: Ham beast is down in my office crying you guys are talking about her in your language -she makes a can you believe this bitch face- what did she do now  

We tell her that she ate an entire pizza and Boss shakes her head. 

She was given a talking too but since her father was a much loved and well respected doctor here so she is given Carte Blanche. 

After that when they do order pizza they order an extra box",Ham Beast devours an entire pizza meant to feed 8 hungry nurses
fatpeoplestories,"I work as a nurse swing shifts in a very busy emergency room. I work 3 12 hr shifts, I am one of the few men who work my shift. I have a few good friends I work with and sometimes we will get goodies for one another. I am six four and two hundred and twenty pounds, I am a former high school and college athlete so I stay active. My wife and I cycle eight-ten miles every weekend and I go to the gym on my days off from work.

That being said I love food..and eating and my new weakness is the chicken sausage, bacon breakfast sandwich at starbucks.

Enter ham beast an absolute unit of a woman, she has been known to demolish an entire pizza ordered to share among the nurses on shift (they ordered 2 large pizzas for eight of us that gave us each two slices)
She also has taken to asking people if they are going to finish all their lunches. She is a respiratory tech which I find funny because gf can barely breathe herself but..

Anyway on this day I stop by Starbucks before my shift starts, i had been running errands all day and never had the chance to sit and eat. So I order a trenta iced green tea and my fav sandwich. 

I grab it hot off the press and take it to eat in the break room, I am preparing to eat when I notice theres no paper towels, I run quickly to the bathroom. 

Im not gone five minutes when I return to see Ham Beast tossing my empty starbucks bag in the trash. She is also drinking the last bit of tea from my trenta drink. 

She notices me and tee hees (reminds me of the youtuber Chantal Marie, in fact Ham beast greatly resembles her)

Her: oh hey there OP!

Me: what the fuck ham beast that was my food?! 

Her: -cueing the waterworks- I am so sorry OP my blood sugar was dropping I was was very weak luckily I saw your food. 

Me: (trying not to stroke out or choke her) you can not just take someone food Ham Beast!

Her: -starting to sniffle- do..don’t yell at me OP (she often does this when anyone questions her)

Me: I will be bringing this up to boss and you will pay me back -storms out-

I start my shift in a pissy mood because I am hungry and pissed off. I tell two coworkers about it and they share the times she has either taken food from them or asked if she can have a bite of their food.

Halfway through my shift I am called up to bosses office, theres hambeast and two people from HR. 

She accused me of threatening her life over her food because I wanted it??? I explained my side and asked them to watch the camera footage of her scarfing my food down. She went pale because Ham beast forgets there is cameras everywhere.  

So they end up pulling the footage and viewing it, needless to say she was written up, given a formal warning, and paid me back.  ","Eat my starbucks, face my wrath"

Don’t be my mother: 56, 5’5 180 lbs. 

Now I love my mother a lot, but she says a lot of things that really get on my nerves. Here are some few. 
1. She talks about how she is eating healthier ( good for her) but she doesn’t understand the concept of serving sizes. 

2. She makes fun of me for drinking diet soda, but has at least 500 cals worth of sweet tea each day. I drink diet, because I don’t like the idea of consuming a lot of cals and sugar through drinks. 

3. She yelled at me for only having a half can of soup when half a can was the serving size. 

4. Tells me that going to the gym was a disorderly behavior, when all she does is sit on her ass .

I could go on, but I think I’ve said enough. ",My moms double standards.
fatpeoplestories,"Hello r/fatpeoplestories!  Another long-time lurker, first time poster.  I never really thought I would have a story to tell here, but this woman is starting to get to me.

I'm six months pregnant, and I work in healthcare.  About two months ago, I transferred to a new work site since I was having frequent dizzy spells.  A little background:  When I was younger, I struggled with disordered eating due to a phobia of vomiting.  Sounds silly, but it's real and it controlled my life for years.  I would only eat foods deemed ""safe"" and I was mostly incapable of eating in front of people.  I would feel sick have a panic attack if anyone tried to push food on me, or if I felt like someone was watching me eat.  I am a lot better now than I used to be, but it does still affect my life, and being pregnant has obviously had its challenges.  If I'm going to be around people for an extended period of time and can't go home, like when I'm at work, I stick to bland foods and prefer to eat alone.

My coworker ""Jen"" is a rather large woman in her late 40s, and she is generally the type of person who makes me nervous.  She is nosy, opinionated, and loud, and she has no concept of personal space.  I feel like she is always staring at me and judging me.  She outed my pregnancy before I was ready to tell everyone and never shuts up about how she can't believe they filled a vacancy with a pregnant transfer.  And she has taken to commenting constantly on my weight and food choices.

For reference, I am 5'3 and weighed 118 lbs at my first prenatal visit.  I now weigh 135 lbs at the six-month mark.  I found the first trimester of pregnancy extremely difficult and I was gaining a little too much weight because I was eating to stave off nausea.  Once the morning sickness subsided, I started writing down everything I eat and tracking calories to make sure I gain weight at a steady pace.

Well, Jen is having none of that.  She mentions my weight every chance she gets, talking about how I don't look pregnant and asking if I'm sure the baby is okay.   She tells me about how she gained 70 lbs with her first pregnancy, but there's nothing she could do about it because she was on bed rest.  She also claims pregnancy made her gluten intolerant, and now she gains weight and can't exercise because of inflammation from gluten.  Every day she brings about a million gluten free snacks with her to work, but throughout the day she will eat these and then go buy regular bags of chips and eat those too.  We have a lot of reps who bring lunch to the office, and she never seems to have a problem with gluten when that happens.

The other day, I was eating a protein bar, and she laughed out loud.  ""Is that ALL you're going to eat?  Oh no, we need to get you something else.  You're going to starve the baby.""

A rep had brought in trays of food that day, and she actually went and made me a big plate of mac and cheese and meatballs.  I immediately felt sick when I realized she was putting food on a plate for me.  She plopped it down in front of me and sneered, ""Feed that baby!""  She went to fix herself a plate (her second helping) and I just threw the whole thing away before I could freak out about it.  She was so busy eating, she didn't seem to notice that I wasn't.

On various other occasions, she has dumped chips on a plate for me, bought me a cookie when she bought one for herself, or brought back an extra bag of chips for me because ""the vending machine gave her 2.""  I always refuse, and she ends up eating the food I turn down.  I'm not sure if that's her goal when she buys it, or if she is just hoping the pregnant girl will eat everything with her.

The final straw was today, when I went to the bathroom and came back to find her... reading my notebook!  It was in my backpack and she just helped herself to it when I stepped away.  I almost cried when I saw her with it, and then I was furious.  She tried to defend herself by saying, ""...but you're always so secretive about it, I thought it would be something about me!!""

I have to admit, though, I laughed on the way home.  See, I am still pregnant and give in to cravings now and then;  I just plan for them and budget around them to stay under my daily calories.  But I still track everything I eat.  Jen must have noticed I had some curly fries sprinkled in with my fruits and vegetables, because as I was packing up my things today, she had one last thing to say:

""So, you really count all your calories? ...Even the bad ones?""

EDIT:  Thank you everyone for the advice.  You are all right, this is something I need to report to HR.  I am nervous about having to confront her in any way, but that just shows how far this has gone and how uncomfortable she is making another person.  If it was happening to anyone else, I would want them to stand up for themselves.. so I need to be strong, too. 

I have dates/times for most of these interactions (mostly from texting my husband about it) so I am putting that all together and going to HR when I return to work tomorrow.  Thank you all again for your help!  :)","I'm 6 months pregnant and my coworker shames me for ""starving the baby"""
fatpeoplestories,"I have a friend who’s a beauty blogger and she just got diagnosed with gestational diabetes. She was understandably devastated, and shared it with her followers. 

She got an outpouring of support, a smattering of the usual judge-y “just concerned” comments, but also a couple of very...”interesting” comments &amp; messages, which she shared with me when I DM-ed her to ask if she was ok. 

There were a bunch of people who were positively *gloating* over her diagnosis. 

A bunch of them had type 2 diabetes and felt they now have a connection with her. Some told her they know how hard it is she has to watch her diet now and many ranted about how judgemental people are and how diabetes can happen to *anyone*. 

One bitch wrote several long essays that can be condensed to, “See? You can’t assume someone’s health just by looking at them! It’s not fair people assume I’m unhealthy while you’re clearly more unhealthy AND “selfishly starving your baby” (actual quote)!”

A few more assholes were snidely going, “See? Your genetics has been keeping you skinny but see how all the crap you’re eating made you sick?”

The funny thing is, from this girl’s pictures and videos, you can already guess with a 99% certainty that this is one of the “not your fault diabetes” cases. 

Her account is makeup oriented so most pictures are from the chest up, and you would never guess she was pregnant if she hadn’t mentioned it. I lost track of her pregnancy and was shocked to find out she was nearly 8 months in when we were talking, because I really can’t tell from her videos &amp; pictures since her stomach isn’t in the frame. 

She told me she dare not post full body pics, because she got a lot of crap from “concerned” people when she posted a full body pic at nearly 6 months –she barely had a bump and just looked slightly bloated. 

True, you may be lead to believe her lifestyle is unhealthy if you stalk her IG stories. She told me pregnant women apparently get crap for:

* Exercising
* Drinking coffee or fruit juice
* Taking any pills, even those prescribed by doctors 
* Eating anything raw, fish, cheese, any meat that has the slightest hint of pink, meat in general (from vegans), vegetables (from the “you’re starving!” crowd)...basically everything  
* Hanging out  anywhere that looks like they serve alcohol

Surprisingly, the only things she could claim to eat without offending anyone were desserts, snacks and fries. That’s it. 

But clearly people could see her toned arms and her size and know that there was no way she wasn’t exercising and only surviving on desserts and snacks, right?

Nope. All these people who I’m 99% sure are suffering from “totally your fault diabetes” are busy chanting, “One of us! One of us!” while the poor girl is wondering wtf is happening. 


She posted a full body video in her stories with an innocent caption along the lines of “these maternity leggings are so comfy!”, naïvely believing it would show she’s not taking crap care of her body and ballooning like crazy.

It actually looks like one of those movie pregnancies where they get a non-pregnant celebrity to just put on a fake bump. I have the same top as her, so I know she was still fitting into non-maternity wear. Her arms, butt &amp; legs are really toned too, so you know she’s been working out. 


People with common sense can *clearly* see she’s been having a healthy pregnancy and taking care of herself, right?

Well, common sense can be surprisingly uncommon sometimes. She ended up getting a lot of, “See??? Skinny doesn’t mean healthy!!! You can’t judge someone’s health by their size!!!”",My friend accidentally became a champion of HAES
fatpeoplestories,"Hey guys! So I have this coworker that is clocking in at about 5'0 (152cm) and 300+ lbs (173+ kg) to give you an idea of how huge she is. We both work the evening shift at an emergency small animal hospital. Let me give you some bite sized stories from working with her, very suitable considering she doesn't know what a ""bite size"" is clearly. 

- She does not cook, if her equally fat husband doesn't cook her a meal she will go get fast food, every single day. She always complains about having no money despite the fact she's spending $20 on dinner alone every day. 

- Both me and my manager are allergic to both dairy and gluten. We are both constantly in poor health. She will ""jokingly"" offer some of her food to us every day just to cackle when we stare at her blankly, as we don't see the joke. 

- Piggybacking off the last story, the other day I came into work &amp; pulled out an apple for dinner. I am in very poor health and couldn't stomach anything else, I ended up not even finishing that. When I was chatting to my manager he nodded sympathetically as we're in the same boat. And of course, Big Chungus needed to 1-up me so she started going on about how she can't eat a proper meal either. She then immediately proceeded to take out a large piece of carrot cake, some Doritos, and Ramen for dinner. My manager and I swapped confused glances but held our tongue. 

- A client came in evening with her dying dog. I grabbed the pet and immediately rushed to treatment. I began stabilizing the crashing animal and shouted for oxygen to be turned on. The oxygen valve is in the back, I can't run to the back and turn it on myself. Chungus was at the computer about 10 feet away and didn't move an inch, even after I shouted. I directly said her name, she didn't hear me. I screamed I ""need fucking oxygen right NOW"" to the point where the client can now hear me screaming all the way in the front, I'm trying to save her dog. Chungus swivels her chair around and instead of running for the first time in her damn life, she lazily calls to the girl in the back who is checking on patients to turn the oxygen on. Luckily our other coworker wasn't busy and turned it on after she heard me scream. Chungus is supposed to be my ""superior"" and know more about veterinary medicine, I was floored after this.

- We have to wear lead vests when taking x-rays. She is so fat that she's not allowed to wear our new vest as she will literally break it, you need to strap her into it. The old vests require you to wrap the straps behind your back, then connect them at the front of the gown and pull the tab to tighten the gown properly. She cannot physically wrap the straps around her body, they don't connect at the front. She ties knots in the gown straps so she doesn't need to bring it all the way to the front of the gown, but she also is too lazy to untie it when she's done. So I always get her shitty fucked up gown and can't secure the vest to myself properly. 

There's a lot more stories I have, but I'll keep this one a Diet version of Chungus. Thanks for listening gang!",Big Chungus works at an Emergency Animal Hospital.
fatpeoplestories,"This is a story of my 20 year old sister, who is called Olivia. She still lives with our parents and plays video games and eats junk food all day long.

Oh, and she’s also fat, in case you weren’t smart enough to figure *that* out.

Recently, Olivia has been targeting me, calling me a “body shamer” and an “entitled skinny bitch” and has been saying to my parents that I’m anorexic. I weigh 120 lbs, which is a perfectly healthy weight while my sister weighs about 410 lbs, nearly 30 stone.



(Honestly, I’m surprised she hasn’t gotten diabetes or died of a heart attack yet. Not that I would want that to happen.)


Anyway, Olivia has high functioning autism, and she uses this as an excuse for her laziness and shitty behavior. Basically, she uses her autism as an advantage.

 Of course, I would understand if she was on the lower part on the spectrum, but since she’s high functioning, I don’t.


Our parents of course, enable her behavior saying it’s all to do with her autism. Now, me and my other five sisters have repeatedly told our parents to have my sister do therapy sessions, but as I just said, they enable my sister’s behavior.

Okay, so now that I’ve got that lengthy introduction out of the way, I’ll tell the story.

So, me and the other sisters (called  Lara, Jill, Kim, Beth and Charlotte who I’ll call Lotte from now on.) visit our parents and sister once every week, essentially to check up on our dad, since he’s been really sick recently and to babysit Olivia for an hour or so.

One week, me and Lotte were making Olivia’s lunch, since she’s either unable to do so herself or just merely lazy. We had the idea to make her something healthy since she eats junk food all the time, and we really don’t want to enable that more.

*Big mistake.*

So me and Lotte make her salad, and we bring it up to her room, where she’ll obviously be.

So we enter her room, and I’m already trying not to gag, since her room absolutely *stinks* since she never showers. We see Olivia playing on her Xbox One, as predicted.



Me: Hello Olivia. Me and Lotte have made you your lunch.



Olivia: Bedder be summut nice.



Lotte: Me and Denise have decided to make you something new. If you don’t like it, I’ll make you a few ham sandwiches, so don’t worry.



Olivia: Well, whad is it?!!



Lotte: Salad. Go on and try some.



Lotte passes Olivia the salad.



Olivia: Ew!! Whad is thish?!!! Whad dyo you take me for?!!! I’m nyot anorexic, you know!



Me: At least try some, Olivia.



Olivia: Nyo! I will nyot try this! Salad is disgoosting!



Me: How do you know if you don’t try it?



Olivia throws the salad on the floor, and it goes everywhere.



Olivia: Fuck you! How dyare you make me salad! Are you trying to poison me, you anorexic whores?!!!! You know I don’t like salad!



Lotte: We were just trying to make you try something new and healthy. Was that so bad?



Olivia: That nearly myade me sick! It myade me gag!



Me: You didn’t even try it.


Now, Olivia is fucking *pissed*. She charges towards me and Charlotte, probably wanting to crush us. Luckily, me and Lotte have pretty good reflexes and we dodge her attack, only her to hit the wall, and falls to the ground.


We call our mother to help us get her off the floor, since she’s too heavy to get up for herself.



Olivia didn’t speak to us after that.",Ham sister tries to assault me because I made her salad
fatpeoplestories,"I'm back with another Cousin Carnie story! I only have a couple more stories after this one because she eventually left town and was no longer my problem. I know some people think I should have cut her out of my life much sooner, but hey, think of all the many hours of amusement we've all gotten from the fact that I didn't!!

If you have no idea who my Cousin Carnie is, you might want to [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/9rh5f9/cousin_carnie_part_1/).

&amp;#x200B;

The TL;dr for this one is simple: Carnie's an idiot. (actual TL;dr at the end)  


By now you know that if you had a list of  possible actions to take in any given situation, A being the Best Choice to make and D being the Worst, Carnie would choose the D every damn time, unless she could somehow find an Option E.  She was just really dumb and lazy. She would make horrible decisions but still reserved the right to whine about the consequences.  This story is a little bit about her being fat, but mostly about her being dumb.

  
One afternoon, Carnie called me up quite upset because her purse had been stolen. This is a terrible situation, so I started out feeling quite a bit of sympathy for her. But, being the curious person I am, I asked a couple of questions.

  
**Me:** They stole your purse? That's terrible!  
*Carnie: I know! I had to cancel my bank card and they'd already used it so I had to have the transactions reversed! They stole my cash – at least $25 that I'll never get back! And now I have to find the time to go down to the DMV and get a new license! This is the worst day of my life! I hate thieves!!!*  
**Me:** I'm so sorry! That's rough! What happened? Was it a purse snatching?  Did someone steal it out of your cart while shopping?  
*Carnie: No, it was in my car at the time.*

  
This is where it becomes a Cousin Carnie Story. Keep in mind she had a fairly old, beat-up car.

  
**Me:** Oh no! They broke into your car to get your purse?? Did they pop the lock? Did they bust the windows? How much damage are you looking at?  
*Carnie: No, they didn't break anything. The car wasn't locked.*  
**Me** (stunned): Um. Forgive me but… why did you leave your purse in your unlocked car?  
*Carnie(whiney voice): Because the door lock is busted on the driver's side! If I lock the door, I can't open it again from the outside and have to climb in through the passenger side! It's really difficult! So I just don't bother to lock it at all. I don't really have a choice!!*  


(Try your best not to imagine obese Carnie struggling to get into the driver's seat from the passenger side. It'll either scar you for life or leave you laughing loudly so that everyone around you will turn to stare at you. Possibly both!)

  
**Me:** Oh-kay, I mean, I guess can understand that. But… but why would you leave your purse in your car when you can't lock the doors?  
*Carnie: Because I was at work at the time!! They won't give us lockers to put our purses in, so I can't bring my purse in to work!*

(She was a cashier at a failing national retail chain that is now out of business.)

**Me** (confused): So… you think your purse is safer out in the parking lot in an unlocked car than in the employee break room?  
*Carnie: Yes!*  
**Me:** (stunned) Well, Carnie, I mean… wouldn't it just be safer to leave your purse at home then?  
*Carnie (exasperated): I HAVE to have my driver's license when I drive!!!*  
**Me:** Okay, but can't you just carry your license in your pocket or something?  
*Carnie (getting mad at me now): When I get done with work I'm going to be HUNGRY and I'm going to need some cash or my debit card to go get something to eat!! And what if I have to run other errands after work??? What am I supposed to dooooooo?*  


Well, I don't know, Carnie, maybe carry your cash or debit card in your pocket? I'm not trying to victim blame – no one should go into your car and steal stuff – but of all the choices she could have made in this situation, why chose *leaving her purse in her unlocked car*?!

  
Of COURSE she has to eat fast food on her way to and from her six-hour shifts at a fast food place. There are NO other options; she might otherwise starve to death!

  
So that's how she lost her purse. And if you thought she learned her lesson, she didn't. No, of course she didn't.

  
Some months later, she called me for sympathy over a new sob story: her car apparently broke down on the way home from work one night – it's unclear how she got home, maybe her husband picked her up or maybe she took a cab. Apparently she left behind, in the car, **Christmas presents** she'd recently bought.  When she and her husband went back to get her car the next afternoon, she says the Christmas presents had been, you guessed it, stolen.

  
*Carnie: I can't believe people would STEAL from my car! And at Christmas time, too! Now my money is gone and I won't be able to give anyone Christmas presents!! I hate thieves!*

  
This time I didn’t even ask why she'd left them in the car, or if she'd left he car unlocked again or because at that point, I was no longer amused by her stories. I didn't want to hear her bizarre nonsensical explanations any more. Even if she *had* locked the doors this time, it still seemed an odd idea to just leave the presents in broken down vehicle, although I don't know, maybe if a cab picked her up there just was no room?  


So when she told me about the stolen presents, I just said to her, ""Well, gee, that sucks,"" and got out of the conversation.

  
TL;dr: Carnie's old junker of a car had problems with the door locks, so she just left her car unlocked. And then she would leave (somewhat) valuable items in the car, and then be upset, surprised and furious when -- on more than one occasion -- stuff got stolen from her car.

fatpeoplestories,"Finally home and hit the gym after being gone for 1.5 months traveling for work and guess who I saw? The overweight young woman that called me ‘conceited’ for watching my form in the mirror when I was lifting weights. 

Looks like she made an equally overweight friend and she actually left me alone this time, but was up to shenanigans. The two spent their time in the gym taking photos of each other “working out” versus actually working out. 

But what prompts this post is this: the funniest thing they did was turn on a treadmill and let it run for about 15 minutes, paused it, then hopped on, took turns taking a bunch of pics showing the dash with them on it, then left.

fatpeoplestories,"The person promoting the fat logic isn’t fat so I’m not 100% sure if this belongs here or not. If it doesn’t, that’s all good, no harm done. 


People involved:

Bug - me // BMI 20.7 // 16 y/o // fat kid who developed anorexia that turned into bulimia. Currently dead set on trying to eat healthily and maintain a low healthy weight (to no avail). yes it pertains to the story. 

M - my birth giver // BMI 24.7 // 48 y/o // although not fat, filled with fat logic or whatever the fuck this is. 

L - my sister // (roughly) BMI 32.3 // 17 y/o // great person, I love her very much. She’s usually quite smart but she’s also stuck in the fat logic ways. 

The story:

I was sitting at the dining room table watching Naruto and enjoying some delicious fried rice while L and M were sitting on the other side of the table, minding their own business. That is until M pipes up about a video she was watching. 

She starts telling us how it’s about this girl who has been obese her whole life and always felt judged for it. This girl had decided to give up on worrying about her weight and start loving her body as it is. My mom mentioned something about how the girl was trying to get into the dating scene, but it was difficult because of her weight. I spoke up:

Bug: “i guess people aren’t as willing to date someone who doesn’t take care of themselves”

M: “you don’t know that she doesn’t take care of herself! She seems perfectly healthy. Healthier than you, anyways”

Bug: “you can’t be obese and healthy. I’m not healthy either, but I get that a lot of people might not want to be with me because of my issues”

L, condescendingly: “no, some people have actual medical problems”

Bug: “that’s true, but you can go to the doctor for that and get medication”

M: “why should she get medication for it? Maybe she’d rather just be happy with her body”

I didn’t really even know what to say to that. I was completely dumbfounded as to why she’d think that people are prescribed thyroid medication for aesthetic reasons. The argument continued for a bit and then turned into this:

M: “would you tell a 3 year old that it’s their fault that they’re fat?”

Bug: “no. It wouldn’t be their fault, it would be their parents”

*bad idea, she took this as a personal attack on her*

M: “ARE YOU SAYING I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED YOU FROM EATING?!”

Bug: “that’s not what I was talking about. Also, I was never obese. This girl was obese at three years old”

M: “YOU USED TO EAT INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF PASTA. WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO, STOP YOU FROM EATING?!”

Bug: “actually yeah. You could’ve taken away the option to eat pasta and replaced it with the option to eat fruits and vegetables instead”

M continued to go off on me until the subject changed slights. It turned into this:

Bug: “you wouldn’t say that someone who is underweight is healthy but a person who is obese is?”

L: “they could have actual conditions!”

*That would still make them unhealthy though?*

M: “you’re far more likely to die from anorexia than you are to die of obesity”

Bug: “more people die from obesity than anorexia”

M: “you’re not healthy and you’re underweight”

Bug: “I’m not underweight”

M: “anyone can tell just by looking at you that you’re underweight”

Bug: “but I’m literally not underweight. The normalization of obesity is so bad that you can’t see a thin person as normal”

M: “you need to be a higher weight for your body type”

what.

That went on for a while and then came the grand finale:

M: “it’s actually racist for you to think that one type of body is better than another because some races are built bigger than others”

Bug, laughing: “you’re joking, right?”

M: “no? On your dads side of the family everyone has a stockier build because of their genetics”

Bug: “bone structure is genetic, but weight is not. There is an obesity crisis in Mexico because of the fact that unhealthy food is so much cheaper and there’s so much more poverty. It’s not because of genetics. You’re telling me that wanting to be slim and in shape is racist?”

M: “yes. weight is TOTALLY influenced by genetics. It’s the same as those black girls who think they’re ugly because of their curly hair. It’s internalized racism”

Bug: “... no it is not the same thing”

The argument continued, but those are the highlights. Now my mom is mad at me because she thinks I’m a bigot who hates her families heritage all because I want to be healthy and don’t agree with the promotion of giving up on healthy living. That’s a yikes from me, dawg

Update: something just happened and I’m upset about it but I think it’s appropriate and fitting. I was eating a box of chocolates and L comes up and (without asking or saying anything) takes a handful. I didn’t care, it’s just a few chocolates, but then she goes for more and tries to basically dumb the box out into her hand. I took the box from her and told her something along the lines of “hey these are mine”. She then says in the rudest voice, “not like you need them anyways”. She and M laughed and I didn’t really know what to say. How u gonna act like I’m fatphobic and then do that?",It is RACIST to think that being slender and in shape is better than being overweight/obese
fatpeoplestories,"Alright buckle in I've got a tale from retail. I used to work at target and I worked there for 7 months being manipulated to sign people up for red cards, even had my job threatened by the same person who witnessed my PANIC ATTACK over them but that's another story for another day. (never sign up for a target redcard people, the interest for the credit card the interest is in the 20s and the debit card isn't a good idea either since someone hacked that shit a bit back and got fuuuuuck tons of card numbers stolen, 5% off and free shipping on certain items isn't worth it, just don't do it, I HATED tricking people into getting it). There was this fatass black family all on mobility scooters that would come shop late at night for whatever the fuck reason. anyway the mom of the family is entitled as fuck, I will call the entitled mom EM and my retarded manager RM. So I was just at the register minding my own business and A FUCKING EARTHQUAKE STARTS HAPPENING, EVERYTHING FLIES OF THE SHELVES AND I FALL TO THE FLOOR- oh it's just scooter family. The husband looks like he's about to fucking die because he's deadass estimated (and I am excellent at guessing weight) 600 fucking pounds, a fat grandma or aunt on a scooter and the children, an older boy, and younger girl and a baby, look bored as fuck, thankfully not caught their parents ""genetics"" yet.

I greet them in my customer service tone and start ringing up their items when I get to a Disney doll and the mom starts talking about how the ""barbie"" is 50% off without saying where the discount was. I corrected her and said ""that's a disney doll"" and she said "" whatever"" in the coldest tone I've heard in all my months of working there and glared at me . I mentally roll my eyes and start looking for it around the register and when I don't find it I start getting inpatient (didn't know I was bipolar then, unmediated), I start talking back and forth with the woman who swore up and down that there was a discount on the ""barbie"" while staring at me like I was stupid, eventually I lose my patience and grab my coworker (who is FAR too good to work there) who is ungodly patient. While I'm helping the next customer I notice that my customer has a barbie, I smile and say ""there might be a discount on that, another customer told me about it, let me check cartwheel"" (Target's discount app, you can add things to your virtual cart and the cashier scans the barcode for all of them then it all applies) and when I get to the toy section, it dawns on me that there IS NO BARBIE DISCOUNT AT ALL. I just smile angrily and say ""she lied to me"" the customer who I was helping at the moment (who was not like EM in the slightest) told me it was okay and I collected myself, I finished helping her and excused myself for a moment to go whisper to my coworker who was helping EM that she was a fat dirty liar (not exact words), then go give her spawn some stickers because, I do like kids, raised by an evil Hamplanet of the Mcdonald's Galaxy or not. When I tell my coworker EM flipped out about how disrespectful I was being and when my retarded manager RM came, EM starts shit talking me saying how she doesn't want me to help her anymore and how I've been rude and I DID apologize said I had a bad day. (every day at target was a bad day), I shouldn't have though when i think back, I shouldn't have let that bitch see me like that. Of course EM goes on that's not an excuse blahblahblah, this is where my manager takes me to come talk with her. We go over to the food court where surprisingly the hammy EM didn't roll over and demand food from the empty food area for her ""trauma"". I instantly start telling her everrrrrrything that happened but then she goes on to say that target's new policy is basically the guest is always right and to just discount the item. Then I begin to ask her, ""but what If I KNOW for a fact that they are lying?"" then the words, and I shit you not ""That's discrimination"" left her lips. I straight up laughed in her face, I didn't even TRY to hold back or anything, it was fucking loud. She looked embarrassed and sputtered out another reason that I don't remember and the EM ended up getting the discount.

tl;dr obese entitled mom in disabled scooter demands 50% off item, argues with cashier, gets her way while my retarded manager tried to claim it was discrimination to not give it to her discounted.","Fatty lies about discount and get's it because ""discrimination"""
fatpeoplestories,"Hi people! 
Delurking to tell an enchanting tale from my late teens. Will include a TL;DR at the end, hope you enjoy!

BACKGROUND INFO: 


Years ago I used to spend time at a particular clothes' shop, owned by the lady I was dogsitting for. Let's call her SL (shop lady). She mainly sold good quality vintage items, plus a small selection of new items.


I had just recently recovered from a damn long medical ordeal that had the lovely side-effect of having me gain a lot of weight due to medical therapy + subsequent depression/inactivity. I am 5'6"" and I guess I was about 220lbs at that point in time.


Of course I couldn't shop at that place cause nothing fit me, I would mainly hang out to chat some on my way back from uni. But SL was a nice gal and always tried to find something to have me try on and make me feel better about myself. 


She tried to be nice to all of her small clientele, but she could do nothing to appease one particular woman, HP for short (Ham Planet, obviously): 50-ish years old, 4'9"", in the 350-400lbs range, beach ball on sticks type of built.

HP lived in our neighborhood and had been unemployed all her life (stay-at-home mom, y'all!!), so all she did was waddling around some when her husband was not available to chaffeur her. Of course she can't drive. Her kid probably flew the nest ASAP as I've never met him and he should be about my age. Can't blame him really.


HP is not a straightforward malevolent fatty, in public she is very well mannered and speaks in this soft voice: she's the kind of lady that calls everyone 'sweetheart' and never curses. IMHO these facts just make her more vicious. Let me give you a run down of that encounter.

-------


THE STORY


Ordinary afternoon, SL insisted to make me try on a vaguely 50s styled, high waisted skirt.
I'm in the changing room when HP enters, huffin' and puffin'.


So, I am trying on this skirt and it looks damn good! 
My crushed ego pokes its head from the dark pit it had fallen into.
I emerge from behind the curtain to come face to face with HP, that is perusing a rack of extremely small sized shirts and jackets. 

SL lights up and starts complimenting me: ""OMG! I told you it'd be perfect! Turn around, let me see! Isn't she the prettiest thing, Mrs HP?""

HP: ""Oh, sweetie, yes she would be so pretty. But the skirt shows off those big swollen legs and you can totally see her belly!""

My ego instantly falls right back into the pit.

SL comes up to me and pinches the skirt's waist to make it sit properly on me: ""Oh, it's just a tad loose, see, if we were to stitch it like so...""


HP: ""Problem is, dear SL, that these clothes aren't made to fit people that are big boned like me and this young lady!""

*[fun fact: I am a certified big-boned girl, I'll never be a slender dainty beauty. But I also don't weight 400 freaking lbs :D back off b!tch]*

I remain zen and dismiss the conversation: ""Uhm, SL I like the skirt but I need to think about it. May I come back tomorrow to try it again?""

SL grants me the chance to escape and kindly blesses my return to the Land of Changing Room. I take a bit to change back to my clothes to send some texts to my best friend to try and avoid a full breakdown in a public place. She's in the shop next door and texts me she's coming.

While I'm hidden, their convo continues:
SL (trying to remain professional): ""You see, Mrs HP, my usual stock is all vintage [blabla quality blabla specific brands] so not all sizes are available. If there is anything you like I can try to find a modern replica or we could set a free appointment with my trusted seamstress to...""

HP (interrupting): ""My dearest SL, do not take offense, I wish I just could be able to just enter any shop and buy whatever I like! Like that girl!""

""That girl"" (TG from now on) is my friend that has come to the rescue. I hear her say just 'Hi SL, excuse me.' and she comes in the changing room with me with all the intentions to eavesdrop the hell out of it.

SL (about to die from embarrassment): ""Mrs HP, I know that finding a fitting size may be troublesome, but mine is a vintage shop. Even TG may have troubles buying from me at times. As I said, show me what you would like to try on and I will...""

HP: ""Fact is that no one is helping me! I have been TRYING to lose weight, but nothing works! [blabla long MUH THYROID speech, ya know the drill] Society isn't helping, MUH HUSBAND doesn't understand and buys junk food, MUH STRUGGLE!!!""

At that point me and TG are just living our best life in our newfound territory and are trying not to laugh out loud. We decide to come out and make for a quick escape before any of us say something we shouldn't... but SL stops us!

SL buys all the crap HP fed her and is moved to the point of tears. She plops a hand on my shoulder and what she says makes me freeze:
""Mrs HP, maybe you just need a friend to join you in your weight loss journey. See, Drik is losing weight herself and she leaves nearby, maybe you could go on walks together sometimes?""

HP puts on the fakest of smiles: ""Oh, you live nearby? Let's walk together home and chat some more!""

I loathe the idea, but I want to get the truth out of HP, so I don't protest. TG fakes a cough not to laugh her ass off, tells me she still has some shopping to do and leaves the shop.

A couple of minutes later I am sloooowly walking behind HP. She's taking up all of the sidewalk. I glance behind me and loyal TG is stalking us from a safe distance. Making use of my uni major, I go full psychologist mode and prompt HP to tell me about her struggles. It was a LONG talk, will sum it up for you:

Turns out she just likes to eat and hates to do anything that isn't lounging on her couch while watching sappy female-targeted broadcasts that luckily aren't known outside of my country. 

""But what about your husband"", I ask.

HP: ""He doesn't understand MUH CONDITION at all! He always comes back from work with all this junk and keeps driving me everywhere!""

I fake astonishment: ""Oh dear, that sounds bad! How come he buys you junk food? And how come he never wants to accompany you on walks?""

HP: ""Well, I am SO TIRED so I never cook and he can't cook so he buys pre-made food. He always buys stuff from the deli! He doesn't understand that I WANT McDoland's! I yell at him if he doesn't get me McDoland's. The chicken burgers are healthier! [starts sperging about all of McDoland's menu items and how she longs a goodie two-three menus for dinner]""

As we talk and I fake opening a door that isn't my building's door a car pulls over, it's The Husband.


HP's real self emerges violently. Her face gets even more red and she shouts at the top of her lungs:
""WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I HAVE BEEN WALKING SO MUCH (100 metres, btw) MY LEGS HURT! WHY ARE YOU SO LATE!??""

The Husband waves a bag of the cherished McDolan's: ""I know honey I am late, but lookie what I got!""

HP is appeased, disregards me and hops on the car.

------

Nowadays I am long out of that gutter, back to my normal, big-boned self and healthy weight. She's still somewhere around here but I've long stopped seeing her waddle around. Legend goes that you can see her riding The Husband's white steed on a quest for 'healthy' food.

I still have that skirt, SL gave it to me as a present. Had it sized down and it keeps looking gorgeous on me &lt;3

TL;DR: Hamplanet fat-shames me in public place, I go on a quest to understand what's her problem. Turns out she's a spoiled brat. Me and my friend still laugh for hours thinking back about this.

fatpeoplestories,"Maybe be me: f19, 5’7, 140 pounds
Maybe be stepmother: f60, 5’5, a stone or two overweight but trying to be healthier
Maybe be Pool Ham’s wife: f60ish, 5’5, about 200 pounds
Don’t be Pool Ham (moon? Unsure of this sub’s lingo): m60ish, 5’10ish, almost 300 pounds

So, stepmother and I are sitting innocently beside the pool waiting for an exercise class to start when a commotion arises about 20 metres from us. We turn around to investigate - a Man of Size is approaching us slowly. His girth is blocking the entire corridor and the wheezing echoing towards us is honestly quite concerning, but whatever. Good for him for being active. He’s hunched over a pair of crutches, which are struggling valiantly to keep him upright and he almost falls several times navigating the flat, dry terrain between us. 

We look at each other. Do either of us know this man? No, but it’s too late to ask questions, he’s upon us! He laboriously hauls himself up to us (*wheeze*, *pant*, *gasp*) and bares his (surprisingly healthy) teeth. We smile back uncertainly as he squeezes around the edge of the bench we’re sitting on and collapses onto it. His wife appears from behind him (he was big enough to completely hide her from view), telling him to be careful. Oh, wise woman, if only your council had come sooner! 

He instantly topples over backwards, crutches and legs flying into the air. The bench had no back and, while perfectly proportioned for healthily sized people, was clearly not deep enough to accomodate him so he had just slid straight off. Stepmother, wife, and I somehow manage to haul him up, get him balanced on the bench, and collect his stuff (towel, crutches, etc.). 

Pool Ham is embarrassed, but thanks us for our help. It seems that he doesn’t know us but just wanted to share our bench while he waited for the same exercise class to start. Ok, cool. Cue Pool Ham winking conspiratorially at stepmother, nodding his head at the pool, and remarking to her “At least I won’t have to wipe today, eh?”. 

*Record screech*

WHAT?!

Ew, ew, EW

Pool Ham is sniggering to himself, wife is pretending she can’t hear the train wreck unfolding beside her, stepmother fake-laughs, and I sit there with a mildly horrified look on my face. See, he could have been joking. HOWEVER, this pool has very few rules, the most important of them being that all pool users must rinse in one of the showers before entering the water. Pool Ham is covered in sweat, but has clearly not rinsed and has no intention of doing so.

Thankfully, the instructor interrupts to tell everyone to get into the water. I school my features into a more appropriate expression while retching repeatedly in my mind and slip in, somehow loosing track of Pool Ham and his wife behind all the splashing from everyone else. The water is pleasantly cool, but every touch makes me feel sick - I’m surrounded by sweaty, unhygienic Ham germs. No escape. 

The class goes as well as it could. As I’m getting out of the pool (escaping the cesspit), I notice Pool Ham sitting down on another bench at the other end of the pool. He’s clearly been in the pool, but where? I lost track of him before but he wasn’t in the pool during the class...did he get in, immediately decide he didn’t like it and then sit beside the pool for the next hour?

To this day, it remains a mystery. However, when I got home you can bet your bottom dollar I spent twice as long as usual in a boiling hot shower trying to remove any possible microscopic pieces of Pool Ham.",Man of Size contaminates public pool

Hamplanet: Bridget (not her real name) about 400 lbs. 5 foot 6 inches

   
**Meet Bridget**

Bridget lived across from my dorm room when I was a freshman. She's a ""big"" girl but I purposefully pushed that aside because I didn't want to judge her based on that.

A few days later we have a chemistry lab together and I sit with Bridget because I recognized her, and I didn't know anyone else. We start the lab and I realize she is not good at chemistry... I don't think I'm good at chemistry either, but I ended up doing almost everything for the lab.

She did jack shit in the lab. All she did was cry and watch youtube videos. And yes, she cried over everything. Something went wrong with the experiment, she cried, her goggles fogged up, she cried. I was pretty damn sick of that after day one of the lab. 

We did talk a bit and decided to study together during the week since we lived so close.

Bridget and I got to know each other and I thought that she was okay. She was into horseback riding and being outside which surprised me.

The next level of friendship was horrifying so let the stories begin.

Bridget showers every other day, so she smells... and she tries to cover it up with body spray. That just makes it worse. Anyways, once while showering (she told me that it has been a couple of days since her last shower) she was scrubbing her butt and she came across something suck. Bridget picked at it and finally got it free, inspection shows it was a spider... Dead for days, smooched on her bum. She loved this story. I was horrified.

   
 

And that was just the start of the ""friendship"" between me and Bridget.

fatpeoplestories,"I was in my English class in school today and I witnessed a most interesting PowerPoint presentation. It was so interesting in fact that it defied all logic. I was sitting in my English class today (15 year old guy) and we are going through the presentations. It’s a fairly normal deal, you get up talk for three minutes on a random topic and sit down. I had already gone so I had kind of checked out, when this 5’4 probably 250 pound girl gets up. The floor audibly creaks as she walks to the podium and uses her arms to lift her leg up onto the stage. She then proceeds to open up her presentation and the first slide I see is fat phobia and false obesity. I look to my buddy sitting next to me and put my head in my hands. She then proceeds to launch into a 10 minute long misinformation filled rant. Some of the more extreme claims she made were skinny people r fat shaming by being skinny, obesity doesn’t exist and she is a perfect example of healthy woman. This girl is 250 easy. She has broken chairs. She then tried to tell the rest of the class using me as an example that I a 6’2 180 pound kid with visible abs that I was fatter than her and more unhealthy than her. The worst part was the teacher stood up and said everything she said was true. That u can be healthy at that size.",A presentation I witnessed in English class.
fatpeoplestories,"Ok, Since my last post (nearly 24 hours ago, maybe less) a lot of people demanded that I update you all: 

I got to school at 6:30 and when I got off the bus, I sped-walked to the VPs office as per her request, and I go into the office, and Mr.Edlardo is giving me the death glare. The VP is on her computer with two resource officers. I'm intimidated by them because I thought it wouldn't escalate this far.

She sits me down and gets straight to it:

VP: ""Alright u/Gas_Menocide, yesterday, you were given, this pink slip-"" She held it up 

VP: ""and it says you were sent out for Misbehavior?""

Me: ""Yes."" 

VP:""Mind walking me through everything that happened?"" 

I explain everything that happened the day prior, and how I was trying to tell Mr.Edlardo that he was pausing the video too much, putting his input in the video, how he sent me out for being ""FatPhobic"" 

VP: ""and what exactly did you say.""

Me: ""Mr.Edlardo, can you please stop pausing the video, we don't need your opinions on the video."" 

VP raises an Eyebrow at Mr.Edlardo and says to him 

VP: ""That isn't what you told me, Mr.Edlardo. You told me that your temporary student, [My Name], got up and kept disrupting the class, throwing pencils, and I quote ""She was also talking on her cell phone"" ."" 

She then turns to me and says 

VP: ""[My Name], I do believe you, I do think you are entirely in the right, however, I legally cannot reprimand him without solid proof that he did this and I'll need the [Principles Name]'s signature to approve a full reprimandation."" 

Mr.Edlardo has this shit-eating grin on his face.

Vp: ""If it is true that he *did* do these things, I will conduct an investigation. Mr.Edlardo, although the schools Code of Conduct clearly gives you rights to perform a full write-up (A.k.A Pink Slipping), I am only allowed to dismiss you for the day, you are required to see [Principles Name] when he returns from Medical Leave, for a Verbal Language write-up. [My Name] you can return to class.""

fatpeoplestories,"This just happened, and I'm just sitting in a bathroom stall shaking in anger and shock, I don't know how to react to this, I'm not a confrontational person but I'm so sorry if my thoughts aren't very clear in this post:

Background story: 

I failed health class back in 2015, because the teacher I had at the time, required us to do physical stuff, like dress out in rediculously tight uniforms and run laps, do the FitnessGram Pacer Test etc. So my school's cirriculum requires this class to graduate high school. I had offered to get that class ""forgiven"" which means you can cross out the grade you got during said class and re-do it for a better grade.

My teacher this year, was a teacher whose name I will censor for the sake of this FPS, her name will be Mrs.Mindy.
Now a few months back, Mrs.Mindy fell pregnant with a baby boy and would take days off because of doctors appointments, and when she gave birth to her baby boy, she took her leave and during the time from her taking days off and her leave, we would get a lot of substitute teachers.

Some of them were nice, others talkative, some were strict, and others woukd let us play kahoot. 
Then incomes our Substitute
 
We will call him:

Mr.Edlardo. (sorry for all the people named Eduardo) 

Now Mr.Edlardo, is a solid 300 pound 6'0"" in his mid-40's, he has a large beer-belly as he waddles into class with a caddy that held notebooks, health books, pencils, all the supplies a sub could have. 

He tells us this: 

""Alright class-"" he says through heavy breathing ""The assignment Mrs.Mindy left y'all should tell you guys what to do, once everyone is done, Ill play the video she told me to play, and you'll take notes."" 

So we do the first half of the assignment (12 questions on nutrition, and its importances) then Mr.Edlardo turns on the projector, pulls up the schools online video player and pulls up the video and it plays. 

The first few words of the video says: 

*weight loss is an important topic in modern day society, in this lesson, we will be going over the following:*

**Importance of Exercise**

**Importance Of Dieting**

**Weightloss Myths**

**Identifying Nutrition Facts** 

And already Mr.Lard, has this face of discomfort on his face, and my first thought is ""Maybe it's because he has to use the bathroom."" So I shrug it off. 
10 minutes into the first part of the unit, and this guy is pausing the video after it says how much exercise an average adult needs to maintain their weight. 

Mr.Lardo:"" That's not really true, I work out 3 hours a day, lifting weights and my body type hasn't changed whatsoever."" Maybe it was true maybe not, I'm no professor in weightloss on the body building part, but who am I to judge.

He then resumes the video and it moves onto the healthy dieting portion: 

*healthy dieting is an important factor in basic human health. Having a healthy diet is important to avoid illnesses later on in life-* 

Mr.Edlardo: ""To be 100% honest will y'all; it really doesn't matter what you eat, no one geniunely cares unless its your doctor"" 

He resumes the video: 

*an average male needs at least 2500 calories to maintain his current weight and 2000 to lose a pound. While an average female needs 2000 calories to maintain, and about 1500 calories to lose weight.* 

Mr.Edlardo: ""Once again, weightloss, nobody really cares about your body or your weight, I don't really know why Mrs.Mindy suggested this video, when it just promotes disordered eating.""

I get this itch in my throat to say something, then comes, the third part of this 1 hr video: Weightloss Myths: 

*Weightloss can vary between person to person, it depends on many factors such as: genetics, sex, exercise level - which is when you're either sedentary or active- or BMI. BMI is defined as Body Mass Index, where it measures the body on Fat content, height, and weight. This applies to adult men and women. However-* 

Mr.Lardo: ""Ok, this doesn't apply to anything, that BMI bull is just another myth to lure you guys into a life of disordered eating and-"" 

I get up and speak up: ""Mr.Edlardo, can you please not pause the video, this class is only 80 minutes long, and we don't have a lot of time for your commentary or beliefs."" 

Mr.Edlardo gets up from Mrs.Mindy's desk and waddles over to mines: 

Mr.Edlardo: ""I'm the substitue teacher, you have no right to back-talk me like that!"" .

Me: ""I'm not back-talking, I'm saying most of us here are trying to get through this class so we can all graduate. We don't need 90% of your input in a video that is directly from the school textbook."" I'm shaking, because I was a model student and never got in trouble for teacher-student confrontation;  

He begins ""why don't you go up yourself, and teach the class."" His face is cherry red; 

Mr.Edlardo: ""Well, since you think you know more about weight-loss than the video, why don't you teach the class.""

Me: ""I don't *want* to teach the class, I'm implying that there's no need to have your opinions over a video reading a textbook that was written by actual professors, and other 'smart people'."" 

Mr.Edlardo: ""Then get out."" He points to the door.

I'm in shock, I've never been sent out before (aforementioned Model Student who never gotten in trouble) Mr.Edlardo, now was sitting at Mrs.Mindy's desk, and is writing a pink slip as I'm packing up my stuff. 

A pink slip is a pass to detention. 
I read it and in blue ink it says:

*I'm sending u/Gas_Menocide to you for Disrespectful Behavior.* with a check mark next to ISS and Assistant Principals office. 

Mr.Edlardo then ushers me out the door, and says his final parting words: 

Mr.Edlardo: ""I will not tolerate Fatphobes nor fatphobic behavior in the classroom, go before I lose my patience."" 

Me: ""But-"" 

Mr.Edlardo: "" GO! Get out of my classroom NOW!"" 

Its been twenty minutes since this happened and I'm scared to go down to the assistant principle, because she likes me, and knows I'm not a bad student. I'm so worried she will think that I let ger down.

Edit: I went to the Assistant Principal, and I told her about the situation, She just told me to sit in ISS, and she will go to the teacher herself. I'm not in official punishment, It's more of a holding cell-like area. I still have yet to hear back from her. 

Edit 2: I went home and I'm expected to come back to VPs Office tomorrow morning. My friend (T1 friend from my other post, who is re-taking the same class as me because of a ""requested forgiveness"" for getting a D- in the same class in 2017) texted me saying that Mr.Edlardo, was making unnecessary threats to anyone who interrupted the video with their ""Fatphobia"" and ""Falsified statements"" and that if anyone had anything to say, they can take it up with Vice Principal. Im pretty convinced he's on a power trip.","Substitute Teacher Ham says I'm Fatphobic to call out his misinformation and bullshit in Health Class then proceeds to send me to detention for ""disrespectful behavior"""
fatpeoplestories,"A little background to start (a little more in the middle due to relevance.)

Right now I am doing a study abroad in Ireland. I am older than most of the students who attend the college or who used the same program to do their study abroad. (I'm 26 and most are around 19-21). This is interesting because of what the girl said to me. 

Regardless, I am using Tinder for what people normally use Tinder. I've met some great and meh women but (lets call her M) M was by far the most interesting. 

After matching we talked for a nignt and then in the morning I asked if she wanted to go for drinks that night and she said yes. We had been getting along nicely and it would've been great to meet up. As the night comes around, I go to meet her at one of the many pubs in our area. Now I'm a little excited because she was pretty and around my age (25). Thing is she only had two pictures and both were just her face. But she had slimming features so I didn't think much of it. 

As I get to the pub, I don't recognize her in the smallish crowd. So I order a beer and sit, about to message her if she made it over alright. Before I do so, I  hear ""Tom?"" (Thats not my real name). I look up and i faintly recognized the girl in front of me. ""M?"" Yep! It was her. Problem was she had heavily photoshopped her pictures and she was actually 20 not 25. She was around 200ish and 5'4ish. (I'm bad at guessing) I basically was catfished. Regardless, I was there, I had a beer, and I wasn't going to get up and leave. 

So we get to talking and I realize that she was a sweet person. Was. During the time we talked she would flirt and touch me to show her interest. Now, I don't care if someone touches me, I'm relaxed if someone does. But the entire time, I kept any flirting nonexistent. I didn't want to send signals or give her a reason to believe I was interested. Now what happens next is where it gets interesting. But first have to give some background 

I'm a pretty open guy to women. They can taller, shorter, younger, older etc. But I've had sex with fat women before and it's not attractive. I can't enjoy it and I've tried. I just don't see large women sexually attractive.

Well the night was wrapping up and we walk out of the bar and down the street. Classic 'she had to go left and I needed to go right' scenario happens. We hug and as soon as I'm about to leave she asks ""Are you gonna invite me to your flat?"" I sheepishly say no. She reponds ""Oh right, you are studying abroad, you probably have a twin bed."" (Which is true, I miss my queen back home.) ""Why don't you come back with me to my flat?"" Again I say no. ""Why?"" I respond by stating that she catfished me and I wouldn't have come if I would've known what she really looked like. 

Welp I guess that was the worst thing to say. M starts going on and on about how I don't like fat people, and I'm some elitist. She says that I'm not in great shape (which is trueish, I'm 5'10 and weigh around 170ish last i checked. But I haven't been working for 3 months, so I've lost some muscle.) She even says ""Your old bones would probably break after the first thrust!"" Which I actually laughed out loud at. Or how I was too afraid to try a ""healthier"" woman because I would be into it. She created this scene and one guy jumped in and asked me if everything was alright. I said shes mad that I didn't want to go to her flat after she catfished me. What he said still makes me chuckle ""You not into fat chicks?"" I shake me head. He responds ""Ya me neither, good luck mate."" And walks away

This made her explode even more. But I see the green light for crossing the street the way I need to go. I turn on my heel and walk away, not saying goodbye or anything. All I hear is her yelling at me as I walked away. As I was walking home, I deleted her Tinder from my matches. Once I got home, one of the girls that lives in the same complex sees me and recognizes my distress. She invited me out for some tea and we talked. Apparently, M had done this to one of her friends as well. So, I feel bad for any other guy who meets M out there. 

Do I feel bad for myself? Nah. Could the situation have gone any better? Nah. Will I be deleting Tinder? Nah. Haha",Unfortunate Misinterpretation
fatpeoplestories,"My health and social care class at my college is quit small,there are only 6 people in on my allotted days so we know each other pretty well and get on just fine.However there is one girl,(let’s call her Zooey) that I do not particularly like but can still have a decent conversation with, as I’m not one to bitch about people and be an asshole just because we don’t click.Zooey is your stereotypical entitled queen B, she is very confident and likes to be centre stage where ever she goes, for example in conversations she will revert any topic to herself and has an in your face personality, not to mention she is one hell of a bully. 

So anyway back to the topic you came here for, I was in class and we had about 20 minuets before the teacher arrived, so we are all just sitting and talking and somehow the conversation turned into a self pity fest for Zooey and what she thinks about her weight, this is the conversation. 
(Me:me) (z:Zooey) (K:other classmate Karl) 

Z(out of know where): “I’m so fat I need to loose weight”
Know one knew what to say and after a moment of awkward silence I decided to take one for the team so to speak.
Me: ”as long as you eat healthy and in moderation and exercise you should start to lose weight”
I said this in a casual and kind manner as she was obviously looking for a response to her comment.
Zooey: “I know but then I’ll lose my boobs”
Me: “not necessarily it’s all about your body shape”
Zooey: “you’ve  got no tits (my name) so just stop okay”
I was quit shocked and the others where quit shocked too by her comment, first what has my body got to do with this and second a B cup might not be her D cup but I don’t appreciate the negative connotations she was trying to put on the comment.
K: “what’s (my name) breast size got to do with you healthy eating.”
Z: “cos I don’t wanna be a stick like (my name) people will think I’m anorexic”

Wow I mean i had had enough at this point, I was in no way a twig, I have a slim build but hold most of my body fat in my thighs and butt(I’m pear shaped) and in her mind being a healthy weight was anorexic looking. 
 
Me: “Zooey what the hell is wrong with you are you stupid or something”(clearly done with her shit, which is out of character for me)

Z: “oh calm your tits, oh wait you’ve got none”
 
Again wow, I try and give her some advice and this is what I get is this bitch ,trying to make me feel shit,for only freaking Jesus on a bicycle knows why.
 At this point I just leave the room annoyed and a bit angry, I’m not a argumentative person at all and I am definitely a people pleaser so I just didn’t know how to even begin defending myself with out offending her.","Obese classmate body shaming me (Female, 5ft4 127 pounds)"
fatpeoplestories,"So, I work at comic conventions in a booth with my mom (who wasn't there in this story.) At this one show I'm sitting on a pillow on a folding chair to the front left side of the booth so customers can see me and I can talk to them easily without shouting.  
I am the least threatening person on the planet, 100 pounds, 5 feet, on this day wearing a cat ear hoodie and shorts. The guy is waddley level overweight.  
HNB: Ham Neckbeard Me: me  
HNB comes up to me sweating: ""I need that seat""  
Now, for context, there are no public chairs in the exhibitor hall, it's a busy place where you're supposed to SHOP and keep moving, not take up space, ESPECIALLY not in someones booth space. Vendors get chairs and a table as needed during setup. I have no table, just a chair.  
Me, a little flabbergasted, ""sorry what?""  
HNB now being rude ""I-NEED-THAT-SEAT-MOVE-PLEASE""  
Me ""Uhh I work here""  
HNB ""Then you should be WORKING. I NEED THAT SEAT""  
Me ""No I mean this booth, I'm working in this booth, this is MY chair""  
HNB now fuming, dramatically drops his bags right in front of me ""I need that chair more than YOU princess.""  
Yes, he called me princess in the rudest way possible. I start TRYING to explain: ""You can't just sit in a vendors chair in their booth, there's seating by the food"" I grab the event booklet to show the map but he interrupts me YELLING now-  
"" I have ASTHMA. A booth babe shouldn't be sitting ANYWAY. Do you see any of the others SITTING? That's because they aren't LAZY. I'm going to tell your boss you're a lazy little bitch who's rude to customers!""  
I think I paused her in shock for a bit. First I am in no way a booth babe, I sell art and it's MY business. I am deeply offended now so I said this in my bitch voice:  
""I CAN'T WALK. THERE'S my CHAIR."" I point to the empty back wall where my mobility scooter is sitting empty  
Does neckbeard apologize? Nope he doubles down.  
HNB ""You can walk. You probably ride that for attention. You don't need it if you can sit in a chair"" here he crosses his arms like he's completely outsmarted me  
""I have MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY. My mom HELPED me to sit here. Disabled peoples asses aren't glued to their chairs.""  
I am not shitting you, he took a step in so he was WAY too close to me, and said to me ""prove it""  
Again, I was totally shocked and lost it. I started to tear up and trying NOT to cry told him ""get out of my fucking booth!""  
He wouldn't move and just laughed at me. I couldn't get away (I can't even stand) so i grabbed my phone and called my mom. While looking at him I told my mom to hurry back and started explaining there's a guy who won't leave me alone and I need help.  
Once I said it like that I think it freaked him out that he might be in shit.   
He huffed said WHATEVER and left.  
I was shaken, told my mom and security but he didn't come back.  
I've had other (non-ham) scary encounters, now I make sure I'm never alone in public.

fatpeoplestories,"Greeting, FPS! First off, I am not even sure belongs here. Moderators, please axe it if need be. 

Here goes,

**Characters:**

Kinvara (me), 26 F, 5'6, 123 lbs. Down from 217 lbs over a year ago with the help of swimming, CiCo, and cycling.

CadMan, early to mid-50s, about 5'10. Will come to his weight later.

LilyPad, CadMan's wife. Maybe late 40s, 5'4, perhaps 170-180 lbs.

So I met CadMan at an event. I am an aspiring writer and the event was organised by a major publishing house. A sort of meet-and-greet where newbies like me could hobnob with stalwarts of the industry. CadMan is one of these people.

Anyway, he seemed to be a highly intelligent and knowledgeable man, very helpful, and a father figure sort. I really looked up to him. His wife LilyPad is a veteran journalist and I have met her a couple of times as well.

One day CadMan asked me to meet him for coffee as he wanted to discuss a writing deal. I have written a book of short stories which I have been peddling a while. I was thrilled beyond words and immediately agreed. We met at an upscale cafe and discussed my work at length. He said he would expedite the process and also ensure that I got a handsome advance too.

I was thrilled. He then suggested we go on to a fancy restaurant nearby  to celebrate. I agreed heartily and said dinner would be my treat. 

Up until this point, I only thought of him as a mentor. A decent, intelligent man who liked my work enough to give me a leg up in the industry.

So we reached Fancy Restaurant, ordered drinks and appetisers, and started to talk. I asked him about the early days of his career, secrets of the publishing industry, etc. Then I asked him how he met his wife. 

His expression changed instantly from joviality to something of slight disgust. He said ""Oh come now, let's not talk about her. We've come here to have a good time""

This surprised me because they seemed very much in love. LilyPad seemed to adore him and the feeling seemed mutual, at least in the few times I met them together.

So I tried to be tactful (this is something very difficult for me to do) and said something along the lines of ""But...why? She seems amazing. And she is so resourceful, really brilliant""

CadMan: Well sure. But resourcefulness and intelligence aren't enough to make a man get it up in bed...

To say I was gobsmacked would be an exaggeration. Never once had he even alluded to anything sexual before. And this was way too much personal information. I did not know what to say so I just stared down at my drink, cheeks flaming in embarrassment. 

I don't know why, he took my silence as a cue to elaborate.

""When I met her 23 years ago, she was a slim and ravishing beauty. My, she was breathtaking. I didn't care a whit about how well she wrote or how ambitious she was. She was gorgeous. Look at her now though. She's totally let herself go. She hogs all day and does not exercise. I feel repelled by her, honestly.""

By this time I was really irritated. Also like I mentioned, I am **not** a tactful person. 

""But Mr. CadMan, she looks absolutely beautiful even now. And I am very shocked at the way you talk about her. Even if at first you may have been attracted to her looks, surely you also fell for her as a person? And so what if she has gained some weight over the years? So have you, I am sure. It is really not appropriate for you to be talking shit about your wife in front of me, or anybody, for that matter""

I could see that sweet writing deal slipping away from me, but honestly, I did not care.

He was unfazed though, quite shockingly. 

""Oh but so what if I have gained weight? It's okay for a man. As long as we have successful careers, it does not matter what we look like. Women on the other hand...""

I tried to barge into the argument here before he cut me off and put a hand on my knee. The shock struck me dumb. He continued,

""A young and beautiful woman like you will go far. Capitalise upon your looks as long as you have them. In fact, you already are. Why do you think I am helping you with the deal? I'll tell you. The moment I first saw you, I knew I wanted you in my bed. Not because I love your writing. Plenty of good writers around but not all of them look like you do, you see. A man in my position is always looking for upgrades, be they in gadgets, cars, homes, or women. I am woefully lagging in the last aspect. You could be my upgrade. Just wait and watch how far it takes you...""

And then he started to slide his hand towards my inner thigh

I smacked his hand away, stood up and stormed out without another word. It was a crowded restaurant and I did not want to create a scene by yelling at/slapping him as he deserved.

I blocked him from all forms of communication. There are ways to get a book published which don't involve being someone's sexual upgrade.

Oh also, since I promised to mention his weight later, he weighed easily 320-340 lbs. The entitlement was strong in this one.

                                *The End*



","So apparently, I am an upgrade"

fatpeoplestories,"Hi everyone and hope you're all having a lovely weekend. This is going to be a little shorter because jetlag, 3 cups of black coffee and the fact that my husband-to-be is currently ooh-ing and aah-ing at the latest expensive toys from a certain big name electronics manufacturer.

&amp;#x200B;

So for context, Mr Mian (33M, 175cm, 78kg buff with panty dropping smile) has started a new job at the end of last year and I (29F, 160cm, now 65kg and still working towards 55kg) am finally starting a new job close to him after dealing with all the red tape. To celebrate this we take a short weekend break to a nearby city with a really pretty theatrical venue. Whilst we were wandering around, we noticed that Body Worlds was having an exhibition in the CBD. Being massive nerds we decided to pay a slightly painful admission fee to bring ourselves back to anatomy class, minus a re-enactment of my best friend fainting.

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst we were looking at the exhibits and being impressed on how the exhibition makes an effort to educate us on how amazing our bodies are, I noticed out of the corner of my eye a group of four whose members were of considerable size (three ladies and a gentleman, &gt;150kg per person), along with two ladies. One lady was my height and pretty much sphere shaped, whilst the other was Mr Mian's height and normal sized. They were around the part of the exhibition showcasing what people eat around the world and the effects of poor habits on the human body. The family were absolutely lovely, however I could tell they were uncomfortable with what Sphere Lady (SL) had to say.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Be us and members of larger sized family, enjoying the exhibition like normal people.  
&gt;  
&gt;Notice SL grumbling.  
&gt;  
&gt;SL: ""The organisers should know better, telling us certain diets and body weights are unhealthy is fat shaming!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Quizzical look from larger sized family. She continues her rant.  
&gt;  
&gt;SL: ""I mean I don't eat that much, and still am the same weight! Also I'm sure I'm healthier than most normal weight people, at my latest checkup everything was perfect.""  
&gt;  
&gt;SL's companion looks visibly uncomfortable, along with larger sized family.  
&gt;  
&gt;Larger family quickly move on as politely as they could.  
&gt;  
&gt;SL huffs, sits on a bench and rants some more (I couldn't catch what she said afterwards as was looking for Mr Mian who had moved on)

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I found Mr Mian near the end of the exhibit hall. Soon after we spot the dynamic duo of SL and her companion. Guess she was still ranting about HAES...

&gt;SL points at Mr Mian, and spouts this piece of gold:  
&gt;  
&gt;SL: ""After all, being larger doesn't affect women that much. My muscles are definitely bigger than his! Right babe?""  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Mian and I turn around, as SL was pretty loud.  
&gt;  
&gt;SL's companion looks visibly embarrassed after noticing I noticed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mortified me avoids eye contact.

&amp;#x200B;

Before Mr Mian burst into laughter and embarrassed the ladies even further than the damage inflicted by SL, I ushered him off to the gift shop where I nearly bought a doll. Thankfully for my bank balance, there wasn't enough room in our luggage.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Mr Mian and I go on vacation, look at Body Worlds. Run into HAES adherent and her long suffering partner. TIL anatomy exhibitions are fat shaming.

fatpeoplestories,"So some background story:

My friend, used to be anorexic from 2013-2017 and she looked bone thin, she always used to drink gallons of red-bull, Monster energy drinks, diet sodas, occasionally she would eat a few grapes and half an oreo cookie. Now this is what caused her to contract diabetes in the first place because of her terrible sugary diet. 

When we went out, it was always, diet pepsi, diet coca cola, diet dr.pepper, or when she was at school, she skipped free breakfast and lunch, and drink about 6 bottles of water on some days, while others were energy drinks.
I kept urging her to get help, but she never really  listened to me. 

It wasn't until me and her were running the track back in 2017 that she fainted, hit her head on the pavement, and was rushed to the hospital. I didn't her from her for days, until she called me and told me that she would have to go to inpatient care for a few months, and that she had type 1 diabetes. 

Now me, not having much knowledge that skinny people could get diabetes, I did my research and was shocked, so I looked for ways I could support her in her journey to recovery. I would call her every single day, to check in on her, and make sure she wasn't lonely, and kept her up-tp-date on all the drama and our first period teacher eventually found out about her incident and bought her a card which, I gave to her mom, and she gave to my friend. 

Now fast forward to 3 days ago, when my friend and her mom were in the local ham boss arena, A.K.A Walmart where we meet our entitled fat person:

Scooticus, Lord of All-you-can-eat Buffets, and king of motorized scooters. 

Now my friend was on a strict, low-sugar diet, alongside with high protein, and high calorie content and her diet was about 2,500 calories and she was extra careful not to over-do it, so she goes shopping for the ""good"" foods like hard boiled eggs, avocados, low-fat, greek yogurt, fruits and vegetables, whole wheat bread, etc. 

So occasionally, my friend gets peckish for her sweets, her sweet tooth kicks in and she's given a brutal reminder that she can't have too much sweets, so she goes to the pharmacy isle in walmart and goes to the diabetic section, where she finds diabetic socks, and one of the snacks she's allowed to have which is Keto Bars. Her mom tells her to get the last box, in which she does.

In rolls Scooticus. 

I'd say Scooticus is a good 600 pound man. His foot was hanging off the blue scooter, and you could see his disfigured leg through his pants. He stops his scooter and takes a look at my friend who was putting a box of keto bars in her cart. Her mom tells her she will be looking at the other isle, which is vitamin pills. 

Her mom steps away from the cart, and leaves her alone with Scooticus, which if he had the ability to stand up and devour her in his sweaty saggy gut, he would've. Then he says this to my friend: 

SC=Yours truly, Scooticus
MF=My Friend
MFM= My friends Mom 

SC: ""I don't get why you need those, you're not even fat enough to be on a diet."" 

MF: ""I'm sorry, what?"" 

SC: ""Young lady, you heard me, your not even diabetic, and yet your taking diabetic snacks. You don't even physically look diabetic.""

MF: ""I actually have T1 diabetes."" 

SC: ""Your still taking MY Snack."" 

At this point, she pulls out a Blood sugar Monitor, and shows it to Scooticus: 

MF: ""See!"" 

SC: ""that's probably a fake! Give me the snack, Now!"" 

Scooticus puts the scooter in reverse, and then reaches his arm (that could cause a level 10 earth quake had he slammed it on the floor)  and grabs the box and holds onto it tightly. 

MF: ""Mom! Can you help me"" 

SC: ""These are MY bars."" 

MF: ""you grabbed them out of my cart, they're mines."" 

My friends mom comes around the corner to see Scooticus waving the box of bars in MF's face and MFM demanded that he give her back the box. He doesn't and eventually MFM and MF, decided that it wasn't worth the time and energy to fight a fat guy in a scooter who could drop dead any second. 

MFM paid for the groceries, and went home. 

Since that day, my friend has been doing ok, she's been gaining two pounds per week and as of tomorrow, she's reaching her goal weight of 140. 

TL:DR Entitled Fat Person(600 Lbs) steals Keto bars from my diabetic, recovering anorexic friend and refuses to give them back. 

Edit: Yes, I was misinformed about her type 1 diabetes, thank you to those who helped me understand it better and helped correct me. At the time (2017) I was misinformed on Type 1 which led me to believe that her T1 was caused by the sugary drinks and snacks she was eating!

fatpeoplestories,"I work on a hospital campus in a building that provides lodging for patients receiving treatment for a certain disease.  I don't want to say too much for privacy reasons.  We receive lots of donations from previous grateful guests and charitable organizations.  Also some of us employees donate food and drink items including candy, bottles of water and k cups. I have been watching this story unfold for months (I'm at work right now). Overall it's a great place to work except for this greedy, thieving couple. 

The woman is tall and thin, probably in her 60s. She is receiving treatment.  Her boyfriend is about 6 ft 2 and 350 lbs and same age as her. Every time they stay here they steal something from the kitchens.  My supervisor and I have actually seen them do this. Another employee has also been witness to it. Tonight I brought in a box of K cups. (I should also mention we have cameras in the kitchen.) Well they put some of them out and took most of them.  My boss has caught the woman dumping  the bowl of creamers into her purse! Every time they stay items are missing the next day. I have caught her taking out large bowl of candy and dumping it on the table for her ham boyfriend to devour. I mean this wicker bowl could hold at least 6 bags of candy.  They are also not supposed to have food or drink in their room but we have found empty soda cans and candy wrappers in the room.  We now hide the candy bowl when they come to stay for FREE.

fatpeoplestories,"Long long ago, about around October 2018, I made a post on the Fat Acceptance movement, and how it bothers me. I debated posting this here because I thought it was petty drama but This is what I wrote

As someone who has been struggling with Binge Eating since I was 10 years old, and who has been force fed by grown adults, who had no sense of nutrition, who developed that mentality, I refuse to accept the fact that Obesity should be glorified, or how i should be obligated to move over for you in a taxi/uber, or how your fat logic spreads misinformation on nutrition facts, and how someone who wants to get healthy is bombarded with false info.

**you should choke** 

**As someone who was over-fed as a child, you're a disgusting person, and people like you are the reason why I- as a Fat Acceptance individual, Choose to love my body**

Second comment: 

**Wow, if you think commenting on a Fat acceptance tag on tumblr about how you hate fat bodied people is going to change us, youre wrong sweetie, besides, you're just a Fitspo blog, no one is gonna take you seriously. Your binge eating is probably faked.**

My replies:

Comment 2: *read my first reply, to the first O.P. I post my Fitspo, you post your fatspo, I don't care if you love your body, just don't go around spreading misinfo to people who are trying to lead a healthy lifestyle.*

fatpeoplestories,"I don’t understand the logic behind eating like crap and then exercising thinking it’s a healthy lifestyle. It’s not. 

Multiple times at work women who are slightly overweight/obese would comment on how tiny I am and tell me to eat more/b less concerned about sugar/processed food consumption because they lowkey think I’m anorexic. I just don’t constantly eat snacks where sugar is the first ingredient and instead cook my own meals with actual nutritional value. 

One woman literally spoke about how she goes to the gym everyday and eats a jar of Nutella/ice cream every night, a few minutes later she complains about how little weight she looses. 

My father recently became really invested in going on bike rides and immediately eating any sugary/carb heavy snacks as soon as he gets home. I told him it essentially makes his exercising efforts futile and he just said he’s “burning the calories”. I don’t think it works like that, it really doesn’t work like that. 

(I hate seeing my dad who suffers from low blood pressure (who is also extremely susceptible to heart issues) eat kfc and whatever snacks are open in the fridge whenever, he’s educated enough to know it’s not good for him yet still indulges.)

Me: '5""3 139lbs today..(lost three pounds, probably water weight) works out diligently. Was a much heavier little Butterball (229 and dropped to 181 ) during  the time of the story)   Also uses ADD superpowers along with the rule of no treats in the house to manage junk food cravings(If it is not available I'll forget to eat it. ) 

Shelooklikeaman: Ex friend and former roommate from many years ago.  5'9"" female, claims to be 187lbs, claims to go to the gym, claims to be doing keto , claims to be eating clean, etc. Her real weight will be revealed later. 

So, today I had to go to Hellmart to get my usuals -yogurt,skim milk,eggs,  fruits, veggies, beef tips and....ADD meds refill.

I didn't see Sad little piggy from my previous post, but saw something else instead.

Shelooklikeaman...I had not thought of her in many years. 
 
Sidenote:  she got that name from 
my new neighbors(don't remember
names, cuz moved again since 
then) . We were all drinking whisky shots by the pool on my first Friday  night there.  One neighbor knew and couldn't stand Shelooklikeaman. 
Neighborlady was an  Asian woman in her early thirties and had previously worked with her.  Shelooklikeaman called  New neighbor lady .....Mrs. Swan (from the old Mad T.V. skits).
she got tired of her shit and did the 
catch phrase every time she saw 
Shelooklikeaman. I showed pics all around to confirm and neighborlady, plus  all of the neighbors agreed...she looked like a man. 

Go back in time:
Just after my divorce from the vile, evil  entity I was once stupid enough to have married, I ran into an old college aquaintance.......Shelooklikeaman.
We decided to rent a 2 bedroom apartment together because she had just had a breakup too. 
She was overweight. That was okay. So was I at the time. I thought it would be an ideal arrangement. We both worked, liked keeping things clean, needed our sleep, were eating healthy, needed a friend for support, etc. 

Lies. All Lies. 

Reality?

Shelooklikeaman was a dirty, lazy, food thieving hoe, FILLED with HAES, fatlogic, entitlement, zero nutritional understanding, closet eating,  rage fits over food and imagined man stealing, man shoulders, weird monster hips, board shaped ass,foot odor and delusions of sexiness. She was not pear shaped. She was not apple shaped. She was linebacker shaped.
I'll give her props for her contouring makeup skills though.

She was a food hoarder and binger. We had problems with the kitchen cleanup and storage space from day one.

I didn't cook or eat at home during the week. Most of my meals were from a healthy(owner was a health fanatic) and cheap(thanks to discounts) eatery near my job.  Mostly soups, salads and vegetable dishes with an occasional keto brownie or an awesome black cherry mousse that he made with stevia and other healthy stuff. The only thing I  kept in the fridge were my yogurts, milk and eggs  (which she helped herself to.). I had to keep my apples in the fridge too( get to that later). I kept a few cans of tuna in the pantry. Still not enough room.

Shelooklikeaman for the life of her could not figure out how she couldn't lose weight. She bemoaned that she went to the gym every day after work.

The problem? Well, let's take a look at a typical weekday of food for Shelooklikeaman. Again. I said weekDAY not week.

Breakfast: 2 cups of coffee... Not black.. She drank a quart of sugary liquid creamer per week.... That's 9 servings a day (I freely admit I myself love this stuff, but buy it only if I know I'll have house guests because, it is bad for you and... I like sugary junk) 
2 frozen grands biscuits
2 giant sausage patties
2 thick slices of cheese
2 scrambled egg omeletes (usually  my eggs) for her breakfast biscuit sammiches for extra protein which she slathered with... One with grape jelly, the other with  a spicy mayonnaise mixture that she claimed was Remoulade sauce. I can assure you it was not.  It tasted more like jalapeno mayonnaise with honey and garlic salt. It smelled like mayonnaise 'n shit.  She used it because... It was organic and.....don't you know anything? Organic food is good for you. 
2 frozen hash brown patties-deep fried loaded with ketchup,  16 oz orange juice. Total= 2100 calories

Ready for a work snack?

Every single day she would take an apple(usually one of mine) 100 calories, and a protein meal replacement bar 280 calories,   to work.

Lunch-- she packed that too- in all fairness, it SEEMED normal.... A breast of chicken over a bed of greens, black olives, salad peppers, and cherry tomatoes with vinaigrette. That didn't count the bowl of shredded cheese she packed separately, nor did it count the bag of Texas style parmesan croutons that never left her work bag(I still think she bought a new bag everyday) .  Asian neighbor lady told me later that...yep...she had a quart of ranch in the work fridge that she made every Monday morning. I'm gonna just guess....1500 calories. 

Those croutons and the ranch? I never saw her buy them at the real store anytime I ever shopped with her.  In the times that I went to her gym (I alternated at the time between 2 locations of the same gym depending  on where I was going or what mood I was in.) I never saw her there. I did see her leaving the junk food store (that had prominent displays of the croutons and ranch in the front)  or  eating chips in her car while playing on her cell phone and chatting on tinder, plenty of fish, etc. In front of the discount junk food megastore  across the parking lot on more than one occasion. She always said it was her treat...cuz...just finished working out before I got there...... 🤔 Treat, my ass. I know she didn't waddle her fat ass across the parking lot. 

Dinner anyone?

A typical dinner.. because I watched her eat this many, many times. She NEVER, EVER offered to share. AT ALL. She would sit like a pit bull guarding her food while she ate....not exaggerating. 
One California Kitchens frozen spinach pizza....well, that's not toooo bad, cuz..whole thing is ONLY 790 calories... Yeah, until you add more shredded cheese, jalapeno peppers(cuz, duuuuhhhh, they burn calories) , more black olives(I think she ate a whole can of those everyday too) , a quarter pound of deli ham, a few dozen Pepperoni's(cuz keto, need fats) , on occasion, my leftover fried chicken fingers from a monthly cheat day, now don't forget a four ounce bowl of garlic butter dipping sauce. (Again need fats.... Makes hair shiny) 

I have no idea---gonna guess 2,000 calories?

Two glasses of red wine everyday(sometimes mine) ---240 calories. Did I forget to mention? This is because don't y'all know? Red wine helps the blood. That's why people with high cholesterol should have it everyday . Doctors ALL agree with her.  

Dessert? She would either steal my prized yogurt (usually two or three), go to Starbeetus for a caramel, mocha, white chocolate  frozen slurpee coffee thing,  or just eat a pint of ice cream a few times a week, cuz....it's okay to cheat once in a while if you are eating healthy and exercisin'....mmmmhhmm, okay, whatever. 
 
To her credit, I never did see her drink diet soda. .......I guess her weekly Saturday morning ""real"" juice nectars-- those syrup in a can things  aka, purestbeetusjuice as treats were enough. They must have kept her energy up enough to remind her take care of her feet long enough  to grind her corn chip looking dead skin all over her sofa cushions while sending toenails flying. Yes, she did a weekly manicure so her tinder dates might want to suck her giant piggy toes. No, I never sat on her sofa . (More on that in a minute)

Anytime I did bring in any junk food whatsoever it would just disappear like magic. She was especially fond of Ritz crackers with cream cheese and pepper jelly. I specifically told people at work I would bring that. I ALSO, specifically mentioned to her that I was buying that for a work potluck in a couple of days  and was having none of it because? Too fat. Don't need it. 

Why yes, Shelooklikeaman ate it. All of it. She was sitting on the sofa when I walked in from work ...hmmmm... Supposedly she had already showered from the gym.  Hmmmm,🤔  due to traffic, and her work schedule, the semantics of showering, etc. I calculated that she either left work an hour early or spent eight minutes changing and working out at the gym. 

I heard a suspicious crinkle. Well, I immediately thought that a roach was hiding somewhere, maybe behind the blinds?  Yes, that is why I had to keep my apples in the fridge. More on why (but you can probably already guess) we had roaches. 

I asked her, ""Did you hear that?""

Shelooklikeaman: Whut? ....
 
Did she really think I did not see that her mouth was filled with whitish, brownish goo.... I started to ask her if she was gnawing on a cockroach. 

She attempted to cover the sleeve of Ritz with her fat thigh to hide it. I acted like I didn't see it. I saw the tip of the wrapper of the cream cheese block peeking out of the drawer of the end table. I walked into the kitchen, got one of my yogurts (noticed I had only three of the eight I bought even though I had only eaten...hmmm ...none?) The 2nd block of cream cheese and the entire  4 sleeve box of crackers as well as the jar of pepper jelly were just....gone. Like they had never existed. 

Yes. She thought just stealing all of the food was a really smart gaslight maneuver as long as she successfully got rid of its evidence. She would then flat out deny ever having seen any such thing in the first place and would point blank with a totally puzzled look on her face ask if I was sure I had bought it or maybe I had taken it to work already. The best? She would accuse me of having eaten it all and blaming her. She even went so far as to say, once,  after two 12 ounce bags of chocolate, two cans of condensed milk and 12 Snickers bars,  all meant for my crack cocaine fudge for work went missing ... ""Well, If I ate your food, where are all of the wrappers ? "" I told her she probably ate those too. In reality, she had a garbage bag in her room under the bed. She would sneak it out into the garbage dumpster when nobody was around. 

I'll always wonder though... How did the guys she slept with not smell that garbage bag. I guess though, maybe they thought it was her. Even worse? They liked it. Temporarily at least. 
In the miserable year we honored the lease, she brought home and slept with 13 different men. Scratch that. She found a boyfriend between lease signing and move in date and was exclusive with him for three months. So, nine months.... Scratch that....she found a different boyfriend and was with him for the last two months . Yes, in 7 months she slept with 13 random really weird internet hookups.  That I knew about. I have no idea how many she brought home on the weekends when I went out of town to visit other people. 

 Tattoo guy,
 Recovering heroin addict guy,    Threesome offering guy(ick), 
Guy who brought his friend as if he were trying to fix me up(no thanks, you need teeth and good hair to ride this ride) 
Cigarette, lighter, alcohol, and blanket stealing guy(yes, he actually took the blankets off of my bed for them to use. I bought new blankets and a door lock- never did get my lighter back.)  

Oh, and how could I forget? crotchshot guy.

 I saw her texting furiously with her man hands to give directions to her tinder date. I stepped outside on the side patio to smoke while she was in the shower getting ready to go out. Apparently she just left the front door wide open so her date could let himself in. Yes, I walked back inside ten minutes later to some random guy already  drinking one of my beers while stretched out with one foot propped  on my coffee table and the other draped across the  back of my sofa. 
The problem? He was buttassed naked taking dickpics. 
Just as I was asking him what he was doing she came out of the bathroom in a little towel(no, it didn't cover her) 

She barreled into the living room screaming at me.

Shelooklikeaman: ""Whut the hail dew yew think yer doin! Git, rat now, just git, Inyerroom !!!! Gitcher ass outta here an stawp tryina steal my man!!!!!

Crotchshot blushed and followed her into her bedroom while she changed. I guess he put his clothes on because they left about ten to fifteen minutes later . Maybe he was the only one that she didn't get to sleep with. He showed up the next day while she wasn't home. He had a cup of coffee and smoked a cigarette with me on the patio , apologized profusely said he got carried away, didn't realize anyone else was there and ........... She had asked him to send her a pic when he arrived. WTH?
He  told me he was chagrined when he actually saw her for the first time in just the towel.  To help him I told him if she messaged him just to say her roommate scared him away.  She was mad at me for weeks and told me I had scared crotchshot away. Yeah, it was me...mmmhhhmmm.  


Oh, I almost left out the part about the roaches. No, neither of us were nasty enough to have brought roaches with us and no, we didn't have a true infestation, but we have monster flying roaches in the south. They live in the trees. We have a lot of trees. 

Shelooklikeaman decided that she needed some sun because, well, tanned fat is more attractive than pasty fat . 

Her roasting outfit was a baby blue one piece at least .  She had three bath sheet sized towels. She would drag those across the patio, drape one over the old chaise lounge , wad one up to prop up her stereo (She didn't want to waste her unlimited data on streaming music from her phone.. cuz...I never figured that shit out) . The third towel was used to have snacks. Usually Krispy Kreme  or a party sized bag of tostitos with cheese sauce (usually mine cuz, well, that was one of my few vices..and apparently she was helping me to lose weight because if I didn't see them I would forget I bought them.)  What are roaches attracted to? Food. She tanned on the private  back patio area with a ton of beetus snacks.  She could watch the pool while on our back patio, but nobody could see her. She kept the back door open..this is how the roaches flew in. They were trying to get out of the insufferable heat and..find more food... seriously...... She kept the door wide open why? Because it was too hot outside ...the AC kept her cool. 

Finally, it was move out day!!!!! My friends and family help me and her friends and family helped her to steal my things. Okaaay,  just all of my food, my entire liquor collection which had some pretty expensive and rare stuff,  my cooking utensils,  cook books, etc.  

She tried to flirt with one of my friend's sons. She had to backpedal when he told her she was a fat pedophile. In her defense...he was 6'6 235lbs and didn't look 15. 

She cleaned some, but bitched the entire time . I made sure she cleaned the oven and stove as... I used it a total of three times in a year. I got my deposit back, but discovered a gross thing about her after she had gone. I definitely reported it to management as I wasn't cleaning it.  I don't know if she got her deposit back and do not care.    Her hidden filthy habit? She was too lazy to get out of her bed and blow her nose. She was too lazy to put tissues by her bed.  Her solution? She just flicked her boogers or wiped her snot on the wall by her bed. It wasn't visible while the bed was in place. 

When I saw her in Hellmart I was waiting in line at the pharmacy. I don't think she saw me. I do know she was smaller, but still not the 187 she claimed years ago. She looked to be about 220.  I don't know what she was picking up. It could have been her anti anxiety pills or blood pressure meds. Or. It could have been STD stuff cuz....randos. 

Her real weight during the time we lived together? On moving day I needed to get the rest of my bathroom stuff. I heard her talking to herself in the bathroom. She was saying..268? That's bullshit! After I put my scales down in my new bathroom at the new place,  I stepped on and noticed they flickered 268 before registering me at 181.  The oddest thing? She had to have known my scales did that. I, because ADD had forgotten . Unless the reset button is pressed they will show the last weight measured before registering correctly. While I lived with her they always showed zero first then my weight. Hmmmm🤔

Note: even though she did a ton of random, stupid and very selfish things , she was at times okay to be around . She wasn't totally bad. I do sincerely think she had an eating disorder and suffered from severe  depression. She wasn't always mean and bitchy. She, like so many other fat  people (I can relate because I used to be fat) want the same things as everybody else, love, acceptance, true friendship, to know that somebody would give a damn if they died, just once to be told sincerely that they are valuable or beautiful(maybe they do art, maybe they save lives, those are beautiful things too.) They want to know that they are meaningful.  Unfortunately, many of them grasp at every tiny shred of evidence that could provide them with this knowledge only to see it disappear (sort of like the raccoon trying to wash the cotton candy... Some people feel like that little raccoon everyday.)  because their intentions were misunderstood due to their weight overshadowing every single situation.

I didn't wish to speak to her, not because I think she's horrible, but because I simply cannot allow myself to be in her drama.  As for the beautiful things? She DID do  amazing  paintings. She had an innate ability like a Michelangelo or a Davinci. She could sew  like crazy and designed her own clothes... She did dress very well (except for the towels) and made clothing for underprivileged children sometimes in her spare time... She had a big heart for kids and would just fall all over herself to  make babies smile even though she couldn't have any of her own. I sincerely  wish her the best and hope that since she looked smaller, maybe she is fixing herself. 
















","""Shelooklikeaman"""
fatpeoplestories,"Long-time reader here, and I realized I have my own story to contribute. When I was in college, I briefly lived with three roommates. I was skinny, Sarah and Maria were overweight, and Eva was obese. I don’t know her height or weight, but she was approaching a spherical shape.

The other three already knew each other from classes. One night, when Eva was out, Sarah, Maria and I were hanging out in their bedroom. We talked about chores, buying groceries, sharing food, and keeping the apartment clean. On the topic of cleanliness, Maria, the outspoken one, said “Speaking of cleanliness, Betta, you’ve got to stop leaving your bras lying around the apartment.” I asked what she meant; I never left my clothes lying about, let alone my unmentionables. Maria said, “There is a bra in the kitchen right now.” Well I had to see this, because it couldn’t be mine.

We all walked into the kitchen and Maria pointed to a bra on the counter. I told them it wasn’t mine. Maria said it had to be mine. The tag said 34C. I was the only one living there small enough to fit a 34C. Then she picked it up by the straps to show me. The elastic fell and the bra stretched out to at least double its intended length, almost touching the floor. We stood there in silence, then put the bra back on the counter. Eva was wearing a bra meant for someone much smaller than her. We knew she was in denial about her size, but wowza. Even stretched out it too small for her. She must have been in severe discomfort during the day, which explains why she took her bra off when she got home. 

When Eva got home, Maria asked her to stop leaving her bras out, but no one said anything about the size. About a year or so later I learned that Eva developed gout in one of her feet. While she was still in college. I’m not sure if she ever addressed her weight issues.",State of Denial (short)
fatpeoplestories,"Haven’t posted here before, but scrolling through here reminded me of the probably most traumatic event of my entire childhood. Btw English isn’t my first language so sorry for any grammatical errors present.

So personages principale:

I, aged 9, petite and thin for my age but very sporty.

My brother, age 13, tall for age and athletic too, but also wiry.

(I do not like calling people hams but as it is the lingo of this subreddit, I’ll make an exception)

Ham lady, short (maybe 5’2) and about 300 pounds. Not a very considerate person

So, I’m on a skiing holiday with my family in Austria. So my brother and I being bold kiddos, decide that we’re old enough to go up the moderate slope by ourselves. So to get to the summit of this slope, you have to take a chair lift. If you’re not familiar with skiing, a chair lift is just a row of seats on a loop between the bottom and top of a mountain, meaning that you’re basically dangling about 100 feet in the air with just one big roller coaster pole to keep you in place. These things don’t stop and let you out once you get to the top, they just slow down and give you plenty of time to get up and out on the snow. 

So we get in line for the lift, and because we’re only 2 people and this is a 4-person lift, we have to share it with others, which is fair. We get to enjoy the privilege of sharing this lift with ham lady. Now ham lady is huge, like I remember being shocked at her size, we do not usually see people this big here in Europe. Because of this my brother and I decide to split up and sit on each side if her so the lift won’t tip to either side. We get in first, and then she gets in. She is so big, that even though she has 2 seats, her side butt (?) spills onto me, taking over my entire right thigh. I didn’t mind though as it’s cold as shit and the fat kept me warm lol. Everything is peachy keen, until we get to the top. 

This happened very fast, but I remember it in vivid detail. We get to where the ski lift slows down, and the lady starts to mosh her way to the edge of the seat, this movement, that would take a normal person like 2 seconds, takes her way way longer. So my brother and I try to get off now, because we’re about miss our chance. My brother is bigger and is claustrophobic so he panics and pushes his way off. This offends ham lady, who is still trying to move her ass out of the way. I try to get off, but being maybe 60 pounds at this point I am not strong enough to get off ham lady. When I start moving she gets angry and uses me as a push off and finally gets off the lift. However because she is so fat she is also very strong, and the sucker punch to my stomach knocks the wind out of me. At this point we were already about to miss our get off point and ham gets out just in time. I however, am still in the lift when it starts speeding up and turns back around. This is not supposed to happen. I am about 50 feet over the ground with no bar to hold me in place and I am crying from the pain of the ham lady’s push and also fear. Because of this the guy who supervises the lift stops the whole lift. So now I’m dangling in a lift that’s not moving and people on the ground are stopping and staring at this little kid clinging the side of an otherwise empty lift going down instead of up. So I’m just dangling there (along with everyone who’s going up the mountain), crying, for about 20 minutes before they get the lift going again. I have to take it all the way down with no pole or anything just praying I won’t fall out and die. And my brother had to race down the mountain so he could be there to get me when the lift gets down. 

On top of all of this insanity the force of the ham lady’s ham arm bend like 3 of my ribs so I couldn’t ski for the rest of the trip. However the resort did give my family the whole trip for free, and I got a lot of hot chocolate afterwards so I mean at least something good came out of it.

Still haven’t been on a chair lift since though

TLDR: kid gets stuck in open air chair lift because huge lady with limited mobility use her as a set off. Kid gets bend ribs and psychological trauma.","A ski lift, child endangerment and a lady the size of a bouncy castle"
fatpeoplestories,"I had an enounter this afternoon that immediately brought this subreddit to mind. I’ve lurked here quite awhile and I’m a bit excited to actually have something to share. 

So, this afternoon I was walking through the downtown area of my city. This area used to be junkie central until a university set up shop and attempted to clean it up. While it is much better than it had been 10 years ago, there’s still an abundence of skeezy, sketchy people around. You cant go more than a few feet before someone asks you for change and/or a cigarette. This is especially bad around the Tim Horton’s. Because of this, when I have to go down there, I wear headphones so I can ignore these people (I hate talking to randoms so I’d rather just pretend I cant hear them). That was my strategy this afternoon. Until a very large woman stepped directly in front of me. 

I had already heard her say she was homeless and I knew what came next so I tried to just keep walking, as if I couldnt hear her. Well, she wasn’t going to let me ignore her. She stepped directly in front of me, causing me to stop short lest I walk into a wall of flesh. I took one headphone out and waited to tell her no to whatever she wanted. 

“I’m homeless and need some change”. No, this wasn’t framed as a question but I answered anyway by telling her that I didnt carry change or cash (this is actually true). Instead of getting out of my way, she replied “Please? I’m really thursty and I need to buy a drink”. Again, I told her I didn’t have any money to give her as I attempted to go around her, which was made difficult by the fact that she took up most of the sidewalk space. Still not giving up, she pointed to the coffee cup in my hand and asked “Could I just have a sip of your coffee then?”  I think my exact response was “Ew! No! What the fuck is wrong with you?!” 

By this time, I was almost around her and away when she whined “But its just a sip! I didn’t ask for your whole coffee! I’m thuurrsty!”  A grown ass woman actually whined to a stranger like a goddamn toddler! I think I called her disgusting as I was finally able to escape. 

I have never experienced anything like this! Whether or not she actually was homeless, she sure didn’t have a difficult time getting food as she has got to be, hands down, the biggest person I have ever seen IRL. I just dont understand what makes a person think they can ask for a drink out of a strangers coffee. Does this qualify as “ham behaviour”? ",“Homeless” Ham
fatpeoplestories,"Hey everyone, long time lurker here with a doozy.

So I am a female Latina finishing up my master's degree to become a therapist. Graduating in May and super excited. Part of completing the degree is working as a therapist intern for a year. I do groups sessions and individual sessions at a site that treats people with more severe mental health diagnosis. Things like schizophrenia, bipolar, major depression, etc. It has been really amazing working here and I have learned so much. My supervisor is very supportive and nice. 

Let's start at my first week there. I was greeted warmly by everyone there and was told that I would spend my first 2 weeks just shadowing other clinicians and getting to know the ropes. Cool, pretty standard. After the first week, my supervisor asked how I felt about stuff and I said I was fine and excited. She asks if I want to just start my groups and I said yes. The next week I have to ask one therapist for a curriculum for a grief and loss group, let's call her Psychoham. Because we are state-funded we have to cover certain topics in order to keep our funding. But we still have lots of freedom and it allows the group to be run in a therapeutic manner. So I ask Psychoham for the curriculum and she points to some binder in the corner and won't even acknowledge me. I say thank you and again she doesn't show basic manners but whatever I guess it's cool to be rude to the lowly interns. 10 minutes later I hear her talking shit about me in Spanish to another therapist, ""she doesn't even want to do groups, when I started here I did groups on my first week."" Now I'm Latina but blonde and look pretty racially ambiguous so I have caught people doing this before in the past. I already hate her, such an unprofessional pussy who won't complain to my face. Also, I never said I wasn't going to do the group I specifically asked you for the curriculum you whale. Whatever, kept it profesh and did my groups.

A few months later she starts critiquing my lunch and saying that my salads are not going to fill me up and saying omg how can you not eat meat blah blah blah I have to eat my mcgriddles and tall frappe every morning. She even told me that replacing soda with water makes you retain water weight which makes you gain weight. Mind you she is a least 350 pounds middle-aged and single living with her mom and preteen son. I'll pass on the advice homie. She is either gorging herself on 5 piece popeyes meals and large coke or bringing in a tiny lean cuisine and shoveling out terrible diet advice that no one asked for.

Back to the therapy. When I came onboard I was transferred one of Psychoham's individual clients, let's call her Carolina. Carolina is in her 20s and has a history of abuse and struggles to regulate herself emotionally. She has loud outbursts and curses people out when she is frustrated but is never violent. Unbeknownst to me Carolina and Psychoham had beef. They have a very toxic dynamic that didn't allow for them to have a good therapeutic relationship so she was switched. Very unprofessional, I will be saying this a lot. Psychoham is no longer her individual counselor but Carolina still attends her group sessions. They do small things to each other like Carolina won't put her phone away during sessions and Psychoham responds by scolding her in front of the group and asking her to leave. There are rules to group sessions but putting on your best cranky mom voice is not how a therapist should do things. This all escalates to Carolina calling Psychoham a fat bitch to her face. This breaks Psychoham and she files hella complaints, calls HR, demands a meeting with the director. Wayyyy too much hoopla for this one event. In a different setting this makes sense but in our program, there are times where clients are not going to be the most polite and will curse us out. I have a paranoid client with Schizophrenia who somedays says go away don't talk to me I hate you and other days he asks me about the weather. It happens, taking a job with this population means you have to expect this.

My client is suspended and forced to apologize to Psychoham and if she doesn't then she can't come back. It is very forced but I thought it could be a good way to make peace with each other. Cut to this meeting with me, Psychoham, supervisor, and Carolina. Carolina warmly apologizes and Psychoham just stares at her and walks out of the room. Poor Carolina is crushed and is given a terrible example of behavior and states that she can tell she hates her. At our next individual session, Carolina states that the last time she had a group with Psychoham she audibly sighed at her and rolled her eyes. She let other people talk over her and didn't acknowledge her at all. My client doesn't lie and I believe her. I go to my supervisor and voice my concerns because I can't let her get stomped over. The power dynamic is so toxic. And it puts me in a terrible position because I'm just an intern and now forced to snitch on a therapist.

My supervisor believes Carolina as well; she even said that last week Psychoham came to her and said she refused to work with Carolina. When asked why she just said she couldn't and didn't have a big reason. So fucking terrible. My supervisor then asks me to type up what I said verbatim in an email for her own documentation purposes. Say less. She says some people are overly affected by the things clients say to them when they get upset and we need to work on our professionalism. Awesome.

fatpeoplestories,"First post. I don't know how to green text.

Maybe be me  5'3""  female 142lbs , not fat though.  I work out hard and I lift too because I'm superficial sometimes and  want men to check out my butt  and... because I  like fried chicken. 

Don't be Sad little piggy  Also 5'3"" ,female,  but more like 230

Definitely do not be POS. 
Sad little Piggy's leach. 
6'4"" about 220, but of muscle. Perfect hair, perfect abs, Hollywood smile, nice tan.  


I try not to be biased against fat people. Here's why. I went to a popular warehouse store the other  day that I'll refer to as Hellmart. While there, I was seriously craving an ice cream sandwich. An obese girl with what would have been a beautiful face if it weren't for the fat hiding it  was in front of me wearing khaki uniform pants (scrubs, actually, she just became an RN so, this part is important later in that she makes really good money) She was bending over to get her ice cream from the bottom shelf. I noticed her pants ride up as she bent over and watched her self consciously pull at them when she stood up while also pulling her shirt to make sure it covered her stomach . She was about twenty four. I decided to skip the ice cream and opted for Greek yogurt instead. She was very sweet as I passed by her . She asked me why I put my ice cream back. I told her I was trying to eat healthier and already have chips at home. Okay, I lied to her. The truth?  I refuse to keep chips or extra junk at home at all, ever ,  because I know I'll eat it. If I don't buy it I can't eat it. I was only buying a two pack of sandwiches because....rules. oh, almost forgot and because..... I also did not tell her I was going to get my favorite fried chicken, Cole slaw and frenchity fries with extra buttery garlicky Texas toast from the drive thru on the way home. I especially didn't tell her I'd be drowning the chicken  with sweet hot pepper sauce and? What else?  That stuff that comes in the green envelope with a sunrise on it. The one the chicken place has to mix up in vats daily. The one with buttermilk.  You know, the crack cocaine of sauce. No, I  did not tell her because?  Have you ever seen the scootypuffs stampede in Hellmart at the mere mention of the word Ranch?  Do not judge me. I walked an extra mile that day(or at least I told myself I did)  
   She sighed and said she was trying to eat healthy too, but her husband was a junk food fiend and she always had to buy extra for him. She did admit that sometimes when he went out with his friends without her she ate junk food, but said that was only because he usually ate all of the healthy food and would leave the junk for her, yet if sweets  weren't  readily available he would complain.  She also told me he was in school and worked part time so it seemed like his friends came around and ate food too while she was at work. (This really means his girlfriend)  I bid her a good day and continued shopping. A few aisles over yep , scooty puff man was trying to reach the ranch . Even though I was getting mine at the drive through, I politely handed him a packet. No, he didn't ask for four and he didn't stink. He was actually about 90 and only a little fat. He politely said thanks sweetie. As I  continued my shopping I couldn't help, but stare cat a very handsome man dressed like he walked out of a fashion ad. I walked by him. Guess he noticed the butt.  He started flirting with me while I was picking out laundry detergent. He asked for my phone number . I didn't see a ring nor a tan line.  I was happy. I started to talk him, but before then  I heard, ""Honey, did you want me to buy you the Reece's cups or the caramel ones?"" He looked sheepish and told his wife Reece's . Yep, that little fat girl was his wife. She said hello to me again and introduced her husband. He nodded and went over to another aisle. He was waiting for me in the next aisle and  proceeded to try and talk to me. He said his wife was too dense with her fat in her brain to notice. I told him I wasn't interested.  Later I saw them in line. I saw her give him her bank card after she unloaded the groceries. I noticed he got cash back and put it in his wallet. She asked him how much cash back he was getting and reminded him she needed to pay his car payment plus hers.   He said 100.  She asked why. He said he was going out with some people who ""had class with him"" (in case you didn't catch the double speak, think about it) . She looked like she was about to cry. 
    He left her waiting for the groceries to be bagged and went to the parking lot. Guess who tried a third time to talk to me?
 No. I did not get his number. I told him I didn't care how physically attractive he was. He was a hideous pile of shit for treating his wife that way. I got in my car and cried. Then I cried some more. I cried all the way home. Why did I act that way? Well, when we meet people , we don't always know their backstory.  
See, what I failed to mention in the intro?

fatpeoplestories,"So this probably doesn't seem like a big deal, but when it happened, it was all I could think or talk about for a couple of weeks. It was just so weird!


I had to fly Lufthansa coach for work. I had just had surgery, but this travel was unavoidable. The plane was the 2-5-2 seating arrangement. I was in a window seat next to another average sized woman. 


Now if you've never flown Lufthansa, allow me to fill you in about their flight attendants. They really are not 'attendants' so much as dictators. They do what they do. Unapologetically. And they will have no argument about their decisions.



So, a man/woman couple enter the plane. They are about 5 rows in front of me. They attempt to be seated, but there is CLEARLY not enough space for two super morbidly obese people to sit next to each other without one of them hanging halfway into the aisle. I can't even believe either of them got away with purchasing one seat each. They were really big people!!!



The flight attendant notices the dilemma. She doesn't say a word, just grabs the woman by the arm and brought her to my row. She says ""get up"" to the woman next to me and exchanges my neighbor for the female ham. 


First thing, my new neighbor says: ""I need to raise the arm rest, it's digging into me"" and she tries to push my arm off of it. God I can't stand it when people touch me like that. So I tell her ""First, don't touch me ever again. Second, I just had hip surgery and I can't stand to have anything pressing against it. So, no.""


Then she seriously whined at me ""but it's uncomfortable for meeeeeeeee!"" I looked at her and said ""I think excruciating pain beats discomfort any day of the week lady!"" After that, it was a passive aggressive pitiful noise party at me until the meal was served. All that somehow stopped when the meal was served though.


For me, traveling + pain meds = ikky stomach. The meal came, I picked at the salad and decided I was done. I was drinking tea, trying not to vomit when my neighbor reaches out to my tray and grabs my entre! Like my meal was some kind of annex to her tray!!! I looked at her and said ""Ummm, what are you doing?"" She stammers out ""I... Well... I thought you were done!"" I said ""Even if I was, don't you think it would be polite to ASK before grabbing food off of a stranger's plate?"" She just huffed at me. Then she asked me if she could PUH-LEEZ have my cake.


So the flight attendant watched the whole conversation.  Also I was a little loud because I had earphones on. She pushed her cart to our row and said ""I see you're done with this"" and took the tray away just after my neighbor asked for my cake.

I swear those flight attendants must have seen it all before.",So I was on an airplane...
fatpeoplestories,"I'm back with my *favorite* Cousin Carnie story. This is my favorite because it's so over-the-top obnoxious you almost can't believe it. At the time I was furious, but now I can laugh about it. It's funniest when I'm telling this Drunk History style at a party, but you'll have to settle for this version of the story.  
 

I apologize for language, but I can't get through this story without some swears.  I apologize for the length, but to do it justice, it has to be long. TL;dr at the bottom if you are in a hurry.  


If you're new to this series, Carnie is a long-lost, shirt-tail relative I didn't meet until well into adulthood when, by some unfortunate twist of fate, we both ended up living in the same town far from where we grew up. She and her husband were middle-aged, obese, super-lazy and often shockingly dumb.   I'm sure the bot will post previous chapters in the comments to help you get caught up if you need it.   
 

This story includes a preface very similar to the one in the Air Conditioning story. Just like how, when my A/C went out, Carnie couldn't bring herself to even fake some sympathetic noises yet needed massive amounts of sympathy and consolation when the same thing happened to her later, a very similar situation happened about moving.  


About a year after having met Carnie, before I was fully sick of her shit, I was moving to a new house. She knew about it because this was during the time she'd been hanging around my house watching her TV shows and even if I had perhaps forgotten to mention the move to her, not even someone as oblivious as her could have missed the boxes everywhere as I was packing everything up. Not that I ever expected her to, but, as you can imagine, she never once offered to help me with the packing or with the move. And to be perfectly fair, I'm not sure I'd want to help someone else pack, either -- you never know how picky the person will be about how stuff is packed, or blame you if something gets broken, or they can't find it later, etc.   
 

But yeah, no one following this series is the least bit shocked that she didn't even offer to help as a polite gesture.   


We got moved with the help of actual friends and all Carnie wanted to know was what our new address was and when our cable would be hooked back up so she could come over and watch her shows.   


At the time, she was living in a dingy, run-down, small house on the literal wrong-side-of-the-tracks. She'd have all these stories about how the house was falling apart and the slumlord was doing patch work to hold it together but it just kept getting worse. Here are some examples: The plumbing was all messed up and the septic kept backing up into their tub. The roof was leaking, the foundation was cracked/settling and there was a lot of structural damage to the building because of it, like doors not closing or locking properly, floors slanting, big cracks in the walls, etc. The refrigerator died so he brought them another fridge that was too large to fit into the fridge-cutout in the kitchen, so he just parked it *in front of* *the fridge-cutout*, blocking some of the cabinets, making an already small kitchen smaller. (No worries, she's not using the kitchen to cook anyway!!)  The washing machine hookup had some kind of leak so instead of fixing it, he just turned off the water to the washer-hookup and told them to start going to the laundromat. (You can imagine how she, more than anyone, resented having to haul her clothes to the laundromat.)

  
The final straw was when the electrical system overloaded and shorted out one day, leaving them with no electricity. Resetting the fuse box did no good. The electrician the landlord brought in apparently was horrified by what he found and demanded that the whole electrical system had to be rewired to bring the house up to code. The landlord either didn't have the money or had no interest in sinking any more money into that crumbling house, so the house was essentially condemned. I'm fuzzy on the details, but I recall that they temporarily jury-rigged the electricity enough for them to get around in the house for a few days until they could get moved out, although as I recall, they never got electricity working in the kitchen again. I distinctly remember being horrified as she told me a tale of running the fridge via *extension cord* from the living room. (shudder)    


The house clearly wasn't safe enough for them to continue living in. We all can agree on that. Like most of you reading this, I'd have been out of that death trap immediately.   
 

Carnie and Harry didn't sense the urgency.

  
Well, initially, Carnie was a little hysterical about what they would do and where they would move to, since they had no money for a traditional first-last-security with a new place. But then it turned out Mr. Slumlord owned other properties, including a small apartment building (the one they lived in during the whole A/C ordeal). He offered them one of the apartments and while they complained that it was smaller, it was at least nicer than what they had been living in (I mean, what *wouldn't* be?) and they agreed to move there. He immediately gave them the keys to the apartment because (I believe) legally they could not continue living in The Death Trap. Landlord just agreed to move their monthly rent they'd already paid for that month over to the new property, even steven, no new first-last-security required. Great deal for them.  
 

This is where it gets fun. This is where it becomes another Batshit-Crazy Cousin Carnie Story.  


Our saga beings sometime in the fall, fairly early in the month. You may recall how large and allergic to any physical activity Carnie and her husband Harry are. So right away, she cried to me about how were they ever going to get it all moooooved? WHEN would they EVER find time to get all packed with their work schedules???   


To recap, she was working two part-time jobs (but you know, no more than 30 hours a week) and her husband also had two part time jobs (pizza delivery all weekend, and the on-call mechanic job which had him sitting on their sofa most days during the week, waiting to be called in to work).  I suspect they had a little bit of free time on their hands in which to get moved.  
 

Seriously, what does she think the rest of us (some of us with *full time* jobs and commutes!) find time to pack when we have to move? They needed to stop whining, suck it up, and just get it done!  


By the time of this drama, I was pretty much over Carnie's shit. When she whined to me, I politely made sympathetic noises about moving and how much it sucks, I gave a couple of hints and tips that had helped me through my move the previous year, but I didn't volunteer any help. It wasn't as petty as, ""*You* didn't help *me*, so I won't help *you*"" as much as I wasn't going to make it my problem. I knew how lazy she was and that if I went to help, I'd end up doing three times as much work as she was doing. Anyway, she had those mean dogs... Even locked in a crate or another room, they would bark and snarl viciously if someone was in the house.  I didn't want to go help her pack and listen to that all day.   


And it's not like the rest of us didn't have jobs to go to, either. I didn't have endless hours to spend at her house packing!  


One day she apparently tired of waiting for me to offer to help and came right out and asked if we'd help them move. Under normal circumstances, my husband and I don't mind spending an occasional weekend afternoon helping someone out if we have the time and we generally don't expect anything in return. We just like the good karma of being ""good neighbors"". The actual moving of boxes and furniture isn't all that bad if it's not upstairs, and can be an excuse to skip the gym for a couple of days. If I know someone is appreciative, I'm more likely to want to help.   


But these two were different and we knew immediately we'd absolutely regret helping them move. My husband's reaction was swift: ""Oh hell no! They'll end up making us do *all* the work! They won't do *anything*! Count me out!""  
 

I knew he was totally right. Harry claims to have all these heart troubles, and Carnie claims to be unable to lift anything over 10 pounds because she's a *girl* and anyway, she thinks she can't bend or twist much and that her knees are bad. Apparently they had no other friends to ask, though (shocking I know), no money to hire movers, so I sort of felt bad, like how else are these two planet-sized people going to get moved out of the Death Trap at the speed of a waddle? They *had* to get out of that place.   


Somehow guilt got to me. I sort of feared a lecture from my mother if she ever heard Carnie's version of the story through the family grape vine. I could hear it already: ""Well, you could have sucked it up for *one day* for pity's sake! They are FAMILY after all, and what is family for if not to help each other out in a time of need?? I'm really disappointed in you!"" And just imagine my mother's reaction if she finds out Cousin Carnie died in an electrical fire because I didn't help them move. I'd *never* hear the end of it!  (My mother is not as mean as that makes her sound, but you know mothers and their guilt trips!)  
  

With Mother's cameo appearance of Good Angel On My Shoulder ringing in my ears, I reluctantly decided we'd have to help.   
 

This was maybe a week after they'd been given the keys to the new place, and I assumed they were frantic to get out of that garbage house.  I told her, ""Tomorrow we both work, but we can be there Saturday. Is that okay?""  Oh no, she said, that wouldn’t possibly work! Her husband delivers pizza all day Saturdays! He has to work! Oh, okay. Sunday then? No! He delivers pizzas on Sundays, too! They NEED the money!   
 

Look, I understand they need the money, but I didn't understand why they weren't in more of a hurry to get out. It was a freakin' fire trap and they had a place to move to. Why not just get it done?   
 

So I asked: ""Okay, Carnie, which day DO you plan to move?"" And…. she didn't know. She was super vague about it because they really had no plan and had barely started packing yet.   
 

\*throws hands up in the air\*  
 

I said: ""Look, you get packed. Get the boxes and small stuff moved on your days off, and when you're ready to move the furniture, let us know and we'll come over after work one evening and get all the big stuff knocked out at one time."" That's all I could offer.  
 

I didn't hear much from her for the next week or so, and I thought, ""Oh, did I piss her off, and they just decided to do a little at a time on their own and not to bother us? What a relief! I should piss her off more often!!""  


But then around the 21st or 22nd of the month, she called me. ""Hey, how'd the move go?"" I ask. What do I mean? They weren't moved yet. They were *still packing*! What the fuck, Carnie! Here I thought you'd **want** to be out of the place with only half the electricity working and *the fridge operating on an extension cord* and an electrical fire waiting to happen, as soon as fucking possible before it burned down around you. But for you, no rush or anything. Just take your sweet time! No worries! Who thinks like that??   
 

""So when ARE you moving?"" I asked. Well, they’ve been doing a little every evening, she claimed, but Harry thinks he can get a Monday off from the mechanic shop so they plan to move on a Monday. Okay, so like, this coming Monday? Oh no, she says, she couldn't get that Monday off from work, but would probably have the Monday after that off, the last day of the month. Hmm. Okay. Then she asks, *""Do you think you guys could get that day off and come help us?""*  
 

Gee, that kind of a big ask. But she's all, ""What else can we dooooooo? We need help! And you have paid time off, don't you?"" Well, yeah, but, you know, that's not how I wanted to use it! I hedged and said I said I'd see what I could do.   


I looked into it and managed to work a comp day to get that day off, but my husband was all, ""No, I'm not wasting my time off that way! Not on these two! If you really want me to, I'll help a couple of hours in the evening to help with the big stuff, but that's all. They better get their shit together and get most of it done on their own.""    


I loaned them my hand-truck to use to help get stuff moved in the meantime, and reminded them to get as much done ahead of time as they could, so we could be finished that Monday.  They said great. I said, ""Seriously now. I'm not showing up at your place only to find you haven't even started moving and are only half packed. I swear I'll turn around and walk out if you're jerking me around."" They said okay.  
 

A week later, a Saturday or Sunday before The Big Move, I called Carnie to ask what the plan was for Monday. Firstly, I wanted to get a sense of how much they'd actually already gotten done and how much we were going to have to do that day. But also, I knew enough about them by this point to know they are not ""morning people.""  I didn't want them to decide to sleep until one in the afternoon and then not get started until two or three pm if there was a lot to do, you know?  I'd taken **a day off** for this shit, so I was not interested in wasting half the day while I waited for them to roll out of bed.  
 

So I called because I wanted them to know we'd better get started early or I wasn't playing, because I didn't want to be at this until 2 or 3am. SOME of us had to work the next morning.  
 

Hold on to your hats.  
 

She's again vague about when they'll start, because they still don't really have a plan. That makes me itchy. I mean, I don't care if you don't mind planning your own shit, but once you involve me, I need a plan. I'm weird that way.  In the course of the conversation, however, she let it slip out that it was just going to be Harry and me doing the move that day.   


**Me:** What – what do you mean? I thought you said you have the day off.  
*Her: Oh, I do. But my license plate tabs are due this month and I have to go to the DMV on Monday.*  
 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  
Every time. Every god damned time. Just when you think a story can't get any dumber or any more obnoxious, Carnie will find a way to ratchet that shit up to a level 10 on the WTF scale.  


**Me** (flabbergasted): … … … What do you mean?   
 *Her: Well it's the last day of the month! I HAVE to have it done by the end of the month! It can't wait until Tuesday! I'll get a ticket.*  
 **Me:** Well- why the hell didn't you get it done earlier this month?  
 *Her: Well! I've been* ***working*** *and* ***packing****. I haven't had time! Tee hee hee!*  


Let's revisit her part time jobs situation for a moment. She'd work four or five days a week, much of that evenings and weekends because her jobs were retail and a hotel. She certainly had other days off on weekdays during that month. Yet she wants me to believe that she just (shrug) didn't have even ONE day off to get to the DMV that whole month?!!   


**Me** (trying to remain calm and civil): How long. Could it possibly take. At the DMV? Maybe two hours max?  
 *Her: I don't know! It depends on what time I get there! But you KNOW how busy it is on the last day of the month! I could be there three or four hours!*  
 **Me:** Yeah, that's why sensible people don't wait until the last day of the month to go there.  
 *Her:* *I had no* ***choice****!*  
 

I don't know about elsewhere, but driver's license renewals in town, if you have to do them in person, can take four or five hours, which is freakin' ridiculous and is a rant for another day. But vehicle registration renewals go fairly quickly and even the car inspections don't take long, although I've never actually tried to go the very last day of the month.  I felt like she was planning to hide out all day and only pretend it was taking ""hours"" at the DMV.  
 

**Me:** … … … Okay, but you should plan to be there when they open, and be one of the first ones in so you can get out in a hurry and we can get started.  
 *Her: I can* ***try*** *but I don't know what time I'll get there!*  
 **Me** (totally in Mom-mode now): SET. YOUR. ALARM.  
 *Her: But I have to stay up LATE the night before to get everything PACKED for the MOVE. I'll be TIRED.*  
 **Me:** I thought you have been packing all month?  
 *Her: I* ***have*** *been but I'm not done yet!*  


The house wasn't more than 900 square feet. It was small and four total rooms plus a bathroom How much could there possibly be to pack??! She wasn't working that many hours herself. She had no kids and nowhere else she had to be but work or home or the fast-food drive-thru. Her husband had all those hours sitting at home waiting to be called in to work. HOW COULD THEY NOT BE PACKED YET?!! This is almost an entire month from when the house got condemned and they found out they *had* to move.

  
**Me:** So? So you'll be a little tired! That's called Being a Grown Up. You **have** to get up early and get that done so we can get you moved.  
*Her: I'm going to need some SLEEP you know! I can't do all the work of the move when I'm super tired! Tee hee hee!*  
 

In other words: She literally waited until the last day to renew her plates ON PURPOSE so she'd have a **motherfucking excuse** to get out of helping with her own move and already had planned out to stay away all day. These two jackasses had hoped my husband and I would use up *our vacation time from work* to help them while Carnie arranged an ***excuse*** to avoid doing any of the work herself!  **Un-believable!**   
 

This is why nobody likes you, Carnie!!! *This is why you have no other friends!!!!*  


I had no words. My brain was just so angry it had stalled out and I could not form words. Instead I just hung up.  I didn't care anymore how these two got moved. I didn’t care if they burned up in a fire in that death trap. I didn't care if they choked on their next cheeseburger. They deserved it. All of it! 

  
*Now* I laugh about the crazy situation, but at the time I was absolutely livid.

  
I went to work that Monday instead and saved my comp day. They tried calling me at 5pm and I ignored it. If I had taken the day off from work, only to have them wait until 5pm to want to start moving…. I might have gone all Jack Torrence on their asses with a roque mallet. This was the time of year when it got dark early, too!!  I guess that doesn't necessarily mean they only started at 5pm – it's possible they may have just been hoping my husband would help them come move the big furniture that evening as he'd originally planned.   
 

He did not.   
 

I never asked how it went and she never said a word about it. Somehow they got moved but it wasn't my problem. Thankfully.  


At one point a few weeks later, she mentioned they had left stuff behind in the old house because they ""didn't have room"" for everything in the apartment. And when they went back one day to look through some boxes they'd left, they were shocked that someone had broken into the abandoned building and gone through the boxes and taken some stuff. I didn't have much sympathy. While I absolutely agree that people shouldn't break into buildings and take anything that isn't nailed down, I also can see someone assuming that the stuff was abandoned and they didn't think anyone was coming back for it. Lots of people move or get evicted and leave their ""crap"" behind that they don't want to haul away, and other people enjoy scavenging.

  
I didn't actually stop speaking to her at this point, but I was certainly passed the point of helping them. This isn't my last Carnie story, though. I still have at least a couple more for your amusement.  


Sorry this was so long. I'm not succinct. 

  
**TL;dr:** They had to move out of a condemned house that was in really bad shape. Both are obese and claim to have so many health issues that they couldn't do much of the moving work and said they needed our help. They had the entire month to move, waited until the *very last day* of the month, expected my husband and I to *take time off from work* to help them while she chose *that day* of all days to spend at the DMV renewing her plates, all to avoid having to do *any* of the work herself. And then I suspect they didn't even get started until late in the afternoon/early evening - if I'd taken a day off from work for them to wait until 5pm to start working -- well, I think I'd be in jail for assault.  Needless to say, we did NOT help them and they suck as human beings. Somehow they waddled their way to getting moved but I never asked for details.

fatpeoplestories,"So I decided to bring in some Valentine's treats for my coworkers and decorate a little before everybody arrived.  I made a few different things and happened to put peanut butter in most of them, except for one item.  I mean, it's Valentine's day so PB + chocolate or GTFO.  So she comes in, sees the food right away and starts heavily examining what everything is.  As soon as she sees there's peanut butter/pb cups in almost everything she starts complaining.....LOUDLY.

* Manny: 33M, 175cm (5'9""), mostly muscle and American Traditional style tattoos. Bears an uncanny resemblance to Manny Jacinto, hence the nickname. Epic shitlord and amazing PT who will kick your ass if you try to be lazy.
* Captain Pecs: 26M, 178cm (5'10""), buff kickboxing god, pecs like Chris Evans' assets in Captain America. Huge fan of The Rock and Arnie. Has disproportionate number of thirsty clients.
* Thor Jimin: 23M, 178cm (5'10""). Face of Jimin and the body of Chris Hemsworth. Deep inside a smol innocent child who must be protected at all costs.
* Cute Chick: 26F, 155cm (5'1""), beautiful bantamweight. New instructor in the gym and secret badass. Joined her spin class for the cardio, left with a new Pinterest board buddy.
* Ronnie II: 45M, 170cm (5'7""), bear dad type. Veteran trainer, loves pointing out everyone's gainz. Legend says he yells ""Lightweight Baby!!!"" during his own lifting sessions but have yet to witness this. Wicked sense of humour to the point of being a bit of a dick at times.

**Part I: Manny's Not-So-Secret Admirer**

Flashback to the last week of September. I was nearing the end of my notice period after accepting a new job offer and was really excited about it all for career and also some slightly selfish reasons... ^(Got engaged. I love you, future Mr Mian.)

&amp;#x200B;

Due to progress being well on track, it was agreed between Manny and I that I'd be stepping up to training for 2 hours, 5-6 days a week with a combination of lifting heavier weights and circuits. Way-hey!

&amp;#x200B;

It was leg day on the evening this incident occurred, and whilst I was re-racking weights following my last set of squats I espied the approach of the one I shall dub Hungry Eyes. Standing no taller than 150cm (5'1"") and packing what must be at least 95kg (210lb), she had long stringy brown hair with a very 00's highlight job and a complexion so pasty it put Morticia Adams to shame. What unnerved me the most was how she was looking at Manny the same way that my cousin's dog looks at steak that's just come off the BBQ - *very* hungrily, but unlike Poppy the rough collie she was nowhere as adorable. Manny looked like he was actually nervous - something that would have been funny if not for the Fatal Attraction-esque vibes I was getting from this lady here. I started to feel uncomfortable, lest one of us got cannibalised.

&amp;#x200B;

Hungry Eyes winked at Manny and went ""So, have you thought about my offer yet? I bet you can't wait to get your hands on these curves!"" and proceeded with giving the poor man a prolonged bicep squeeze. Manny visibly shuddered as she bounced off to the spin studio, whilst I blinked really hard wondering if my flu medications had hallucinations as a side effect. From Manny's shell-shocked but still pretty face and the audible snorts of repressed laughter from Ronnie II and Captain Pecs... I got to the conclusion that I was not hallucinating. I decided to try and snap my poor trainer out of his daze before considering calling an ambulance for sudden unresponsive state.

&gt;Me: Hey Manny, you okay?  
&gt;  
&gt;Manny: Uh... yeah. I didn't expect that to happen again after last week. 😭😭😭  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Dude, let it out. Those jokers are shitting themselves laughing over there, I think this is as humiliating as it's gonna get.  
&gt;  
&gt;Manny: *Glares at Ronnie II and Captain Pecs cracking up now that Hungry Eyes is out of earshot*  
&gt;  
&gt;Manny: Those bastards.... well might as well tell you, everyone is laughing about it now.

&amp;#x200B;

From the boring conversations that ensued with Manny and Cute Chick, I managed to piece together the events that had led to the episode of swolestation and likely sexual harrassment. Hungry Eyes was a new-ish member who had been in classes for the better part of the last 6 weeks, with Cute Chick as one of her class instructors. Apparently 3 weeks ago Hungry Eyes had approached Manny on the pretext of wanting to take fitness to the next level, along with learning kickboxing. Now Manny is the type of trainer who loves it when people get motivated to improve themselves and agreed to give a free trial hour of training. Sets a time and date for the trial with Hungry Eyes, then she cancelled multiple times until Manny gave up on gaining a potential new client. When she did finally turn up, that's when things got creepy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Be Manny, chilling out at the PT counter between clients with Cute Chick and Thor Jimin.  
&gt;  
&gt;Spot Hungry Eyes approaching the counter. Wonders if she is actually going to take up the free training trial.  
&gt;  
&gt;Puts on professional face.  
&gt;  
&gt;Manny: Hi, haven't seen you for a while! Still up for the trial?  
&gt;  
&gt;Hungry Eyes: *Bats eyelashes*  
&gt;  
&gt;Hungry Eyes: You know what? I rather have you in bed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Manny: Excuse me??? Ma'am it's not appropriate to proposition staff...  
&gt;  
&gt;Hungry Eyes: You heard me cutie! I heard guys naturally prefer bigger women with **curves**... think about my offer!  
&gt;  
&gt;Hungry Eyes: *Butt jiggle as she walks off to Cute Chick's spin class*  
&gt;  
&gt;Thor Jimin: 😲  
&gt;  
&gt;Cute Chick: 😶  
&gt;  
&gt;Manny: Oh God why... 😫

&amp;#x200B;

So began a game of cat-and-mouse, only that the mouse was pretty decent at making himself scarce and keeping his schedule secret from the cat. It got to the extent that on Manny's day off, Hungry Eyes walked up to Ronnie II, demanding to know where Manny was because she missed him *that much,* before everything culminated in the swolesting incident. Before any rabbits were harmed, Hungry Eyes showed a diminished level of gym activity, not turning up to Cute Chick's classes 2 weeks after the incident and disappearing from view by October. The general consensus was that those hunger filled eyes had found a new target and Manny finally knew how it felt not to have to look over his shoulder every 10 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

*In actuality and unbeknownst to Manny... Cute Chick, Thor Jimin and Ronnie II had reported Hungry Eyes to management with the help of witness statements from gym members and managed to get her banned with her membership revoked. No news has been heard of her since.*

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I witnessed a ham sexually harrassing and stalking gym staff. Ham gets banned.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Part II: Why won't the scales shift?**

Now earlier I mentioned that Captain Pecs had a disproportionate number of thirsty clients. As hilarious as those tales may be those stories may not see the light of day here due to lack of fatlogic in most of them, but today we shall focus on one of his non-client admirers who we shall refer to as Scale-Hopper. Scale Hopper was a lady of about 157cm (5'2"") and in the mini planet stage, of about my starting weight of 85kg (187lbs) when I first saw her. However unlike many gym-goers who shed the kilos with a combination of healthy eating and exercise, Scale Hopper only seemed to be static at best. Twice a day she would check in, change, step on the scales and run off with her report. This would happen practically every day including weekends.

&amp;#x200B;

I can hear the question now: ""Hey Banmian, maybe some people have weight fluctuations that make it necessary for them to weigh themselves a bit more frequently?"" Well yes some people do need closer monitoring like a person preparing for a contest, someone who is adjusting their sodium intake to minimise swelling or someone with monstrous PMS and needs reassurance (uhm hi there, only during my period). However, Scale Hopper didn't seem like one of those individuals, she seemed like more of the average gym goer who went to classes and did some independent weight training as they saw fit. Then as the weeks became months, and I came in more often for late morning workouts on my post call days... I noticed one thing: Scale Hopper didn't seem to go to that many classes and didn't touch a piece of equipment by herself, not even the bikes or the ellipticals. Usually she would come in at 11.30am then again at 6.30pm to weigh herself, then leave immediately afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently these times coincided with Captain Pecs' allocated hours to manage the PT counter which was next to the body analyser scales. Okay, maybe it was just coincidence at best, a harmless crush at worst. Then one evening in October I stopped seeing Scale Hopper. At the same time a notice was pasted on the wall with the following words:

**""DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THE BODY ANALYSER SCALES WITHOUT ASSISTANCE FROM A MEMBER OF STAFF.""**

Initially I found it funny. How could someone hurt themselves with scales? Did someone accidentally trip on a wire or bump their head on the display when taking off their shoes? Well news travels fast amongst regulars and from a regular client of Ronnie II's who was lucky (or unfortunate) enough to witness it, this was what transpired...

&amp;#x200B;

Captain Pecs was minding his own business at the PT counter when Scale Hopper turned up one morning. Seeing him there and with hardly anyone else around, Scale Hopper does the usual rigmarole of using the body analyser scales i.e. take off shoes, step on, wait for analysis, etc. Only this time she steps on with one foot and then... dramatically falls onto Captain Pecs in what suspiciously looked like an embrace as he picks up the counter phone. Both fall over backwards and end up in a pretty awkward position where Captain Pecs is pinned down by Scale Hopper who had gotten considerably bigger since I first saw her. Ronnie and his client along with the other gym staff rush over to check if anyone was hurt and are greeted with the scene of Scale Hopper crying at a bewildered Cap.

&gt;Scale Hopper: WHY DO YOU HAVE A RING?! I was waiting for a chance with you!  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Pecs: Huh? I don't get where you're coming from Miss, if you must know yes I am married\*.  
&gt;  
&gt;Scale Hopper: *Bursts into tears and runs off*  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Pecs: O.O  
&gt;  
&gt;Everyone: *WTF just happened*  
&gt;  
&gt;Ronnie's regular: Guys are we on an episode of Punked or Just For Laughs?  
&gt;  
&gt;Thor Jimin who had just walked into work for the late shift: Hi! Uhm why was there a lady crying outside?

&amp;#x200B;

\*Captain Pecs has been happily married for 5 years with 2 adorable kids who thankfully resemble their gorgeous mum.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Mini-planet evolves whilst weighing herself a bit more than the usual gym-goer, secretly has crush on pectorally endowed member of staff, tries to smother object of affection with curves. Thor Jimin remains blissfully unaware of pre shift drama.

&amp;#x200B;","Swolesting, stalking and indecent propositions oh my! (a couple of hammy tales for V-Day)"
fatpeoplestories,"First time posting and I’m sorry to subject y’all to a long story, but I kind of need advice on a certain “friendship”, and in order to explain everything... it needs to be a little long. I could honestly turn this into a series. 
 So, some minor background on my friend, L and myself. We’ve been friends for roughly 15 years, both female, 28 years old. When we first met, I was a lot larger than L, who was petite, while I was rocking XL clothes and just didn’t really take care of myself. As we went off to different colleges I started being more proactive about my health and lost a lot of weight. At 5’3”, I went from close to 190 to 130 pounds. With a healthy diet and exercise routine I was very proud of myself for doing something that required so much discipline and patience, which are two things I struggle with. I was also just happy to be healthy physically and mentally. I was never considered a cute girl and never had romantic attention from the boys I went to school with. I was the typical funny, fat girl friend. I was fine with that title until I realized I deserved better. I even started getting more male attention and even had my first kiss at 20 years old. Just to clarify, having a boyfriend and getting more attention WAS NOT the reason I started losing weight, but I’m not gonna lie and say it didn’t make a girl feel good. L was a typical petite and fairly attractive girl, 5’4” about 120 lbs. We always got along as the outcasts and black sheep of our bigger friend group. We had the same taste in music, movies, and other things like that. In high school I started to not really care about school and while I graduated with honors in history and English, I never considered myself “bookish”. L, on the other hand, was in all of the honors clubs and really prided herself on being so smart. At first, I admired her intellect and wished I enjoyed school as much as she did. I would soon learn that her pride in intellect was actually a toxic obsession with being right about everything. (If anyone cares to read it, I could make an entire post about all of the petty and unnecessary things she’s had to “prove me wrong” about.)
        
So, where I had lost weight and gotten healthier as I left high school, L took the more average route of gaining the dreaded freshman 15. However, I really think her freshman 15 doubled. And as most of these stories go, she kept gaining and kept wondering why she was gaining as a meal of Big Macs and large fries with a dessert of Krispy Kreme dozens sat in front of her. Now, one of my biggest pet peeves is continuous complaining without making the steps to improve or fix the situation. There’s only so much advice that can be given and pity listens to griping that someone can do before you have to realize that changing what your unhappy with takes work and effort on your part. That’s all that L does. Complains, makes minimal effort to lose weight, then keeps complaining that she’s “a fat monster who’s going to die alone”, among other things. 
     
About three years ago, I got really sick and the medication that I was put on and some of the side effects from the medicines I was on cause me to gain weight. I didn’t go back to 190, but with all the work I put in to lose it and feel better, I became very self conscious and developed the worst body image that I’ve ever had. And while I know gaining 30 lbs was kind of out of my control and is preferable to being sick and in and out of hospitals, it just took a toll on me mentally more than physically. But to her credit, L was actually pretty supportive of me when all of this was starting and would let me vent and whine about gaining weight like I had been for her. That was one of the last real times we’ve had that amount of mutual support, because it’s usually L and her life that takes center stage. Which is another common characteristic of most of the subjects of the posts here on this page I’ve noticed. I wonder what makes these people so selfish and self centered. 
      
L has never really had a boyfriend, and I doubt she would’ve even had one if and when she was smaller because she has a very toxic and draining personality. In 2017 I met my now husband, R. The second I told L about him, I could pretty much tell that she was never going to respect this relationship or R or me. I’ve never been the kind of girl who just talks on and on about their boyfriend or relationship, and I wouldn’t to her because I knew she was struggling with being single and I didn’t want to be rude and talk endlessly about mine. But obviously I love him and knew this man was going to be my husband right after our first date, and I guess expecting just a little happiness from her was way too tall an order to ask of her. Every time his name was mentioned, which again, wasn’t often, she would just dismiss everything I said or just grunt a half assed reply. I really did see how one sided this friendship was when I met and started dating R and maybe that should’ve been my cue to cut back on this friendship. When R proposed, her response was more of a disgusted “are you joking?” than a “congratulations!”  She kept making all of my big moments leading up to the wedding, showers, bachelorette party, rehearsal dinner, etc., all about her and saying things like “he doesn’t love you as much as I do” or “he doesn’t know you like I do”, which was funny because she was too up her own ass to know that I was actually pulling away and ready to end our friendship at any given moment. 
   
R is in the military and we got married in December of 2018. After spending most of last year planning the wedding and trying to somehow get myself warmed up to the idea of moving away from the place I’ve lived my entire life and all of that, R told me he was being sent oversees a couple months after the wedding. I knew this would happen, but I was still hoping I’d get to spend the first year of marriage with my husband and I was just overwhelmed from all of these big changes I was making in my life. I told L what was happening, and what kind of response did I get? If you guessed one that in no way involved my feelings and compassion, you’d be 100% correct. L’s response was “well you knew what you were getting into. But at least you’ll be able to stay here so I’m not alone!” I was floored but somehow, not surprised. Even though I was sad and stressed, this person, who claimed to be my best friend, was reveling in my distress because she wouldn’t be “single” alone. I could post sooooo many stories about L, with parts and chapters for each. And maybe that’s what I should’ve done.  And you would think that having all of the “evidence” of her behavior should make this a cut and dry situation, but I am admittedly a pushover and sometimes I need the advice and opinions from others to help see things clearer. 
  
Like I said I’ve never posted my own story before so I’m not sure if this was too long for one post, but I’m kind of lost on what to do. This story doesn’t nearly begin to cover the entire storm that is L, but I guess I needed to start somewhere. I just need to know if I should cut my losses. And if you guys would want more stories involving L and specific situations involving her awfulness I’d be more than happy to share!! 

P.S. I know this post is very jumbled and I apologize if it was difficult to read and gather!!   And thank you for reading this!! ","My “Friend” is a toxic, selfish ham. What do I do? (Possible series of stories?)"
fatpeoplestories,"I was reminded of this instance last evening when video-chatting with the boyfriend, he was pretty annoyed hearing it (though it did happen before we started dating) but I hope y'all aren't! 

&amp;#x200B;

Around last year August or so, I was visiting family in my home city for a bit when boredom led me to swipe right a couple of times on Tinder. One of my matches was a complete dreamboat, his height mentioned as 1.90 m, his pictures showing him playing rugby, those leg muscles...ugh, I'll just stop here. I'm pretty passionate about being active myself, very much enjoy lifting heavy things, HIIT, hiking and generally being on my feet and my country is one of the more fat-permissive Asian societies where women on the side of overweight are seen as desirable (because 'curves') while I'm (at 5'2 and 116 lbs) seen as slightly malnourished in comparison. Its difficult finding others who share the same hobbies so I felt we could hit it off immediately. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reality was...I don't want to be rude but he really should've updated his pictures - they were at LEAST 15-20 years younger and what would earlier have been a hard, strong body was now...just soft, with a belly that stuck out at least a few hands and a butt wider than I stood shoulder to shoulder. I did still find him kinda attractive, he was well-dressed and did have a head full of hair, very Richard Branson-esque. He hadn't lied about his height either, phew! 

&amp;#x200B;

He did have an annoying habit of talking over me several times though, completely ignored my wincing at the billowing clouds from his e-cigarette and would snarkily comment on my 'manly calves'. 'Yeah, its because I used to be super overweight earlier,' I said, keeping my tone gentle, despite swallowing back a little hurt. I'm pretty conscious about my big shoulders and thick arms and legs. 'I do really enjoy strength training now, so I guess that's helped.'

&amp;#x200B;

He snorts. 'Oh yeah, you women with your tiny pink dumbbells.'

&amp;#x200B;

'No, actually, my deadlift max is around 165 lbs.' (Its 200 lbs now, guys!)

&amp;#x200B;

Silence. Dude hides behind his drink. 'Oh.' The continuing silence gets awkward. 'I can probably lift that up with one hand,' he says huffily a minute later. 

&amp;#x200B;

I smile back, not doubting it, but feeling a bit of disappointment sink into the pit of my stomach. What part of this is a competition, I remember wondering and I wish I'd said that out loud. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the evening carried on, I ask him about rugby and get an 'Oh yeah, I likely weigh less than I did when playing because I haven't been working out in a while.' 

&amp;#x200B;

I nodded into my drink, okay, maybe that makes sense, muscle is denser than fat, let's give the man a little benefit of doubt. The speed and alacrity with which he polished off our starters was both a source of fascination and mild disgust. 'I need it to maintain,' he wheezes in between bites, not taking a minute to see if I've gotten anything to eat myself. 'Not like waifs like you need it anyway, huh?'   


I laughed back - come on, benefit of doubt, dude's just kidding - but inwardly, was already calculating the Uber fare for the ride back home. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure why I accompanied him to his room for wine, dude marched up right ahead at least ten strides ahead of me without waiting which was probably when I realized it wasn't gonna work out - not really him being monstrously bigger than his pictures on Tinder or whatever. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few glasses in, he tried to kiss me and that gigantic belly squashed me down so hard I think he mistook my gasp for air as pleasure instead because he started roughly pawing me after. The thought of being crushed under that mass all night pretty much dried me up then and there and I somehow managed to find the breath to mention needing to head home soon. 

  
When I didn't receive a response, I had to undertake the Sisyphian task of wrestling his enormous ravioli-like girth off me and somehow managing to wriggle clean, feeling very much like some kind of reptile slithering out of the mud. For a minute I even wondered if all the bumping and grinding from earlier had induced some kind of cardiac arrest. It was then that I notice the tiny hint of puke on the pillow. Dude rolls off to the side and lies snoring on the sheets, a trail of vomit emerging from his mouth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Never in my life did the Uber I called right after take so damn long to reach. My hair and dress were thankfully untouched but christ, the smell...I hovered around, concerned, just to make sure I didn't have some kind of murder in my hands, but he seemed to be fast asleep, snoring happily, and no more uh, digestive emissions followed. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the longest time, I pretty much just sat there wondering what I'd done for things to end up like this and only getting the gurgling of that enormous abdomen in response. I suppose I do have to thank the guy for providing some unintentional strength training that evening. 

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up the morning after in my own peaceful bed to a pretty pissy barrage of texts about why I'd just up and left when 'things were getting hot and heavy' and was it because he didn't look like his pictures? Hey, at least the man was aware of it, to which I replied politely that yes, it might be better if he did update them to a more uh, recent version. 

&amp;#x200B;

The explosion of abuse and insults that followed ('fucking shallow Indian bitch', 'dumb cunt', 'stupid skinny whore') could've rivaled the average middle-school attending 4chan-user's. I sighed, blocked him, unmatched him from Tinder and enjoyed the rest of my banana pancakes.  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Met a guy from Tinder who was a lot heavier than his pictures, makeout fail, puke involved, instant block. 

&amp;#x200B;",Fatfished by a 'former rugby player'
fatpeoplestories,"Genesis as is the creation of me as the life saving extraordinaire. Duh. 

Obviously, before one becomes a life-saving ham-toting 300k-miles-ambulance-driving EMT, you gotta done get learnt by taking a semester of classes, do 24-48 hours of clinicals, be cute, etc. My class was at a local community college, about 10 of us, and let me tell you - I *loved* it. Made a few good friends and I’m a total nerd so I like to school, but that just made it all the more worse when I started working and ended up loathing it due to being overworked and underpaid while breaking my back lifting Hams that should’ve had a crane instead. 

As always, there was a Ham present in the class, and again as always there was the elephant in the room 😉 in regards to how one would be able to perform EMS duties when they clearly already had a full time job as one of Jupiter’s moons. Our Ham we’ll call Kevina, as she was the only person who irritated me even close to his level (Feeling lost? Read my previous posts and admire my magnificence, then return here). 

Kevina was an overly-emphasized-southern-drawling beachball on sticks for legs. She had been an EMT-I in KentuAlamabamLousiana or something and was getting registered in Ohio since naturally to make life harder there’s not a ton of reciprocity between the states. 

Educational note: EMT-I(ntermediate) was a level in between basic and paramedic that’s been phased out as EMS in the US finally got its act together (not really just better acronyms), it’s now EMT-B and EMT-P as basic peons like me and our overlords the paramedics. 

So it’s all well and good, I could understand Kevina would be a bit irritated as I would be too since these classes plus the registration exam aren’t exactly cheap. 

After the first week in which we did soul-withering ice breakers and other nonsense, we were given a polo with an EMS logo plus our school and we had to wear that with EMS pants, so many pockets me gusta, to every class. Since class was only 2x a week, that wasn’t at all an issue. Except for Kevina, it was a case of an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. 

First day post dress code, Kevina shows up with an alarmingly large amount of makeup on, a crop top (no) with skin tight (no) jeans that left nothing to the imagination (no). 

Our badass teacher was THE MAN, a firefighter paramedic who you could tell took no shit just by looking at his jawline. He reiterated that being out of dress code equaled a zero for the day and asked Kevina to get gone. 

Cue her pulling out every single sort of fat discrimination bologna you can imagine, one of which was that she couldn’t find her size in the required pants. Yours truly rebuffed that as I ordered mine off amazon because I don’t want to leave my house ever, and they had sizes big enough to fit an elephant with room to spare. As she waddled out I was given a glare hateful enough to make my insides boil had I been somewhat of a conscientious person, but I don’t have a heart so I was unbothered. 

Our class moves on an Kevina magically finds pants that fit her, using the plethora of pockets to carry any sort of makeup possible which she liberally applied during class. As if that wasn’t disrespectful enough, she would often interrupt our teacher to say the words that would become ingrained into my mind forever: 

“UmmmmMmMm so I was an EMT-I in the bayou (where I presume she lived alongside the alligators in the mud) and like that’s not what I learned while I was simultaneously rescuing six pregnant mothers and the entire continent of Africa soooooOoOOoooo...”

BadAss teacher would have none of it and quickly shut her down, but he wasn’t our only teacher. Enter DeAnna or whatever her name was who had the spine of an invertebrate. She would entertain Kevina’s bragging BS and what should’ve been a 4 hour class designed to crunch in as much info as possible turned into a 1 hour learning session and a 3 hour discourse on why Kevina was ~soooo~ right and zomg etc. 

It got so bad to the point that multiple members of the class would walk out once it was clear this was a Kevina/DeAnna lovefest, I only wish I could’ve joined them but I’m a lil bitch sometimes so I stayed put. 

DeAnna disappeared after everyone wrote enough complaints to fill the library of Congress, and we got another teacher named Tré, who was just as jawline-blessed and awesome as BadAss. This coincided with the movement of our course from learning to doing, aka practicals. Practicals meaning performing CPR on a mannequin and getting all dramatic like “dammit don’t you give up on me now!!!”

One practical in particular highlighted the massive disconnect between Kevina and reality, which was the EpiPen administration practical. We had these mock EpiPens that imitated the force needed to inject a patient with the needle and their life-saving serum, it had a plastic end that would only retract once a decent amount of pressure was applied. 
So naturally once we finished the lesson we all went around stabbing each other in the back as us kids will do. 

Kevina decided to wait until all the fun had abated, came behind me and “injected” the faux EpiPen into my temple. 

I was a collegiate soccer goalie, have gotten near about 7 concussions, and so my temples are on my and my doctors’ list of places on my head that are extremely vulnerable to a repeat and possibly debilitating TBI from minimal pressure. I heard the click and that was all until I woke up in the ER surrounded by my classmates and Tré. I was released that day, but had a resurgence of my post-concussion syndrome that was tension headaches to the max. 

Conspicuously absent from my maybe deathbed/worship session was Kevina, but she would become a major part of my life for the next year. 

Why? Sing it with me everyone! LAAAAAWWWWSUUUUUUIIIITTTTTS! I wasn’t really into the idea of filing against her, I had great health insurance and was mostly concerned with trying to mitigate my headaches. The decision was solved for me however, when Kevina sued both the school AND ME for fat discrimination. 

Because obviously the only reason I went to the hospital was because a Ham knocked me out. Had it been one of my non-Ham classmates, I would’ve been content to lay on the floor unconscious and then toddled on back home with no issue. 

The lawsuit was rapidly dismissed, I don’t know the details as I was trying to get myself to a point where I could read without feeling like there were 19 knives in my head, but I was able to complete the class and obviously get registered as an EMT as I couldn’t write my previous stories without that precious license card that I had to go to Staples to get laminated. 

Kevina was neither seen nor heard from again, but I always look over my shoulder in case she’s coming after me with another for-teaching-purposes-only EpiPen. ",EMS-trainee vs. The Hams: Genesis
fatpeoplestories,"TLDR: Annoying ham is obsessed with tapas at a Spanish restaurant. 

I had dinner with an obnoxious ham a few weeks ago at a tapas place (Spanish restaurant that serves appetizers in smaller portions. You are meant to order several and share). We were four normal sized women (my mother, myself, and two acquaintances) and one female ham at least 115 kgs. I don't normally eat meals with hams, so I was interested in observing her behavior and seeing if it was much different from normal human consumption. 

The ham immediately ordered a plate of warm tapas for the table, despite the fact that half of us weren't really hungry. Then it kept foisting the food on one of the friends. I think she did this because otherwise she would be the only one eating, as the rest of us were chatting and sipping our drinks. She kept insisting that this one friend eat. She kept looking over the tapas, picking the best ones for herself and pushing the ones she thought ""weird"" to the side. She was so possessive about these damn tapas! 

She had a very judgmental, know-it-all personality, although I was impressed with her ability to identify all the locations you can buy obscure ingredients, since I like to cook. I found her oddly toward hostile toward me, and it's not the first time I've felt that vibe from a very fat woman. She kept criticizing me in subtle ways. 

One of the friends had recently lost weight and was very happy about it, and I really felt like delving into diet talk, just to annoy the ham, but kept quiet. At that point, my mother and I had to leave, so we put money down for our drinks. I offered some money to the ham for the tapas, although she had greedily eaten most of them, and was annoyed she took the money (20 euros for a couple of pieces of potatoes and ham). My bad, but I was a bit drunk.  

Overall, despite the ham's obsession with the tapas, I was impressed that she hadn't gorged herself or eaten that much. As we leave the table, I see another tapa arriving at the table, which the ham had quietly ordered earlier. Of course, oily potatoes, which she immediately begins to huff down. I have a feeling the first round of tapas was her trying to act normal, but once we left, game on!

fatpeoplestories,"Hi everyone! Today we are doing some wibbly-wobbly-timey-wimey stuff (please don't sue me BBC, I'm poor) by time traveling to last June, during my final days of working in the Office of Pain prior to my transfer to the Hospital of Great Knowledge. Having been 3 weeks into my life rehab plan, the kilos were slowly but surely coming off. Thanks CICO (and Manny, my long suffering PT).

&amp;#x200B;

For context you can have a peek at my previous stories, but as a reminder of who today's main players are:

* Thirstyham (TH) - 33F, 100+kg, 165cm. Pinches snacks and dreams of Prince Charming, self-sabotages via HAES mindset and fatlogic.
* Banmian (me) - 29F, 85kg --&gt; 80kg during this tale, 160cm. Began a wonderful journey to happiness and fitness.
* Ruby - 28F, 55kg, 165cm. Quiet, hardworking mum. Loves tea.
* Sammy - 26M, 75kg, 183cm. Fitness enthusiast, super chill guy. Supportive about my life rehab plan.
* Mike - 45M, chunky non-ham, 175cm. Foodie, slowly working towards becoming swole.

&amp;#x200B;

In spite of my best efforts to keep it hush hush, Mike and Sammy got wind of the news of my impending departure and decided to use it as an excuse to take the remaining original members of the Corner of Sighs (now just Ruby and myself) along with their team-mates for a slap up lunch at a local place famous for Cantonese soy sauce chicken. Surprisingly, there was no ThirstyHam tagging along for the ride as she had plans to have lunch with her team at McBeetus and claimed to not like soy sauce chicken that much anyway. Verdict on the famed chicken: it was delicious, more so because I was having a portion appropriate for human consumption along with steamed greens in lieu of noodles/rice. Unfortunately Mike being the overly generous bloke he is had over-ordered\*, which is how our band of merry men and women carted 2 takeaway boxes worth of leftover chicken back to the office.

*\*The food was ordered family style with common serving spoons, so there was no cross-contamination. End of public health announcement.*

&amp;#x200B;

After prolonged debate since no one else actually wanted the responsibility for the chicken, I sent a text to Mummy Mian (my mother and a huge fan of this particular restaurant) asking her if she wanted a box as part of the compensation for having to put up with my annoying self. Mummy Mian's reply was a swift and enthusiastic ""YES! I told Daddy Mian too"". Mike kindly informed me he had set aside a box for Mummy and Daddy Mian and he'll bring back the other box to his girlfriend for their supper. With the great leftover chicken debate of 2018 all settled, we hunkered down to do some actual work.

&amp;#x200B;

4.30pm: I head to the main pantry to brew another mug of green tea so I could finish up those darned spreadsheets in time for my workout. I glimpsed a familiar form sat at one of the pantry tables, hunched over a takeaway box in a pose similar to that of a zombie from Resident Evil feasting on brains (or was it The Evil Within? Hmmmm). Remembering that Mummy Mian didn't raise a wimp, I stepped closer to what I could now determine was ThirstyHam demolishing the contents of a box of chicken. The ham turned and acknowledged my presence.

&gt;TH: Oh hi Banmian didn't see you there! I saw this chicken on this table and was hungry so just helped myself, *teehee*. The gizzards and the wings are so good!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Hey TH it's been a while... uhm just curious, did Mike tell you to help yourself?  
&gt;  
&gt;TH: Oh I didn't bother asking! It wasn't labeled so I assumed it was free for all! I was STARVING, nowadays the portions they give you at McDonalds are so small\* it's not going to sustain me in spin class later!  
&gt;  
&gt;TH: **Omnomnomnomnomnomnom**  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: 🤯

*\*I found out a bit later from Kai, one of ThirstyHam's team members that she had the following items from McBeetus: double spicy chicken sandwich, 6 nuggets, large fries, large normal Coke (ThirstyHam always gave people grief for drinking Coke Zero)*

&amp;#x200B;

My brain and heart nearly broke at the idea of having to explain to my loving parents that some ham might have scoffed down the dinner they had been looking forward to all afternoon. I resisted the strong urge to throw my mug of hot tea at the still nomming ham, politely made my excuses and made my way to Mike's desk.

&gt;Me: Hey Mike, I got some bad news for you but it doesn't involve any of us getting sacked.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mike: Huh? What is it?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: TH has eaten the chicken.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mike: WTF?! Why doesn't she leave people's shit alone? Wait, which box did she eat?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I dunno, both? You left both boxes on the counter no?

A few seconds of uncomfortable silence pass...

&gt;Mike: Ah shit, I realised I left mine on the counter! However I put yours in the fridge and labelled it. Go check if it's there. If it's untouched, tie a triple knot with the plastic bag handles. TH can't pick apart tight knots, she always complains knots are too tough on her nails.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Oh gosh thanks bro! Will go check it. What about your missus though?  
&gt;  
&gt;Mike: Not sure. She doesn't know as it was meant to be a surprise, seriously don't worry about it. I'll figure something out for her.

&amp;#x200B;

A quick check in the communal fridge revealed Mummy and Daddy Mian's supper clearly labelled, intact and undisturbed by anyone, ham or otherwise. As per Mike's advice I tied a tight triple knot on the plastic bag before carefully storing it behind a pack of Ruby's green apples. From the corner of my eye I spotted ThirstyHam shuffling back to her desk, after she had picked Mike's and Mrs Mike's intended supper clean to the bones and left said bones out in the open on the communal table. I proceeded to clean up the ham's mess, scrubbed my hands with antibacterial handwash thrice before continuing on with my day, whilst wishing that my planned prayers at the Iron Temple would cleanse my mind of the horror I had to witness that afternoon. For a while I also felt really bad as Mike's girlfriend was one of the sweetest people ever, but further catch ups confirmed this was not the first or the last time such nonsense had occurred in the office.

&amp;#x200B;

Gentle readers, there is a happy ending to this tale. Mummy and Daddy Mian thoroughly enjoyed their supper and vowed to go to the same outlet to procure further meals the next time they were in town. I discovered burpees were not torture but actually pretty fun. Mike's lady love never found out about the chicken and they had an amazing date night featuring one of Mike's show off steak dinners.

&amp;#x200B;

As for ThirstyHam?

I got a text from her during my morning workout the next day: ""Worst stomach upset ever! I had to go to the toilet 5 times today!!!""

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Team has farewell lunch for yours truly, leftover chicken gets packed for my parents and colleague's partner to avoid food waste. Ham comes back still hungry from McBeetus lunch, proceeds to polish off a box of chicken in the pantry. By a stroke of luck my parents still get to have their dinner. Karma is a bitch to the chicken stealing ham.

fatpeoplestories,"Hiya guys, long time lurker, first time poster etc etc, y'all know the shindig. 

So I'm at my cousin's 18th birthday party and, being the only one in this place who is the same age as him (I'm 20 days younger than him) and also part of his family, I'm in a weird in-between. Basically, I don't know any of his friends and all our family is mostly comprised of 40+ year-olds, except for his sister who is 9. Therefore, all night I've been sitting at a table reading up on all the beetus goodness I've missed and something fitting of this sub just happened.

Let me give you a bit of context on my family: everyone except myself, my mom and the cousin whose birthday party I'm at (we'll call him Andre) is obese. Yes, including the 9-year-old. Let's call her Dee. 

Now, before I get started on telling you the story, quick disclaimer. My family isn't really filled with fatlogic, they're just ignorant/uneducated about healthy eating and drinking habits. They're mostly nice people.

I can't give you a lot of details about Dee. I'm gonna try and estimate her height to maybe 150 cm ish. The closest estimate as to how much she weighs is that at my thinnest (165 cm, 60 kg) her wrist was thicker than mine (probably still is now, when I'm 65 kg) and when we sat down her thighs were a bit larger than mine.

So it's midnight and the cake comes out. After the singing and celebrating and all that fun stuff, it's time the guests get their slice of cake. Andre, being the birthday boy, gets a separate mini-cake while the rest of us get the normal cake. No big deal, it's his birthday after all.

As the servers put the slices of cake on the tables, I take a look around the room and see Dee at the table we, the cousins, sit at, with the special mini-cake in front of her. I don't think much of it at first, I only saw it for a couple of seconds.

I come back to the table a couple minutes later to wait for my own slice of cake. A server comes round and puts a plate in front of me. He notices that the mini-cake is not placed at Andre's seat so he puts it where it's supposed to be, and gives Dee a normal slice of cake.

Dee comes back shortly and swaps the two plates. I stop her and tell her that the mini-cake is for Andre, since it's his birthday. She answers:

""But the waiter put it at my seat""

Doubt. Both waiters who were serving us knew where Andre's seat was.

""The waiter came back and gave Andre this cake and gave you the normal slice.""

""But the waiter gave me the plate""

""Well the waiter who came in later gave Andre the cake""
 
(For the sake of clarity, by ""gave the plate to someone"" I mean that they put in front of their seat on the table)

She pouted and looked sadly at her slice of cake. 

After a couple minutes, Andre still hasn't come to eat the cake so Dee took some of the fondant star decorations on top of the mini-cake, muttering something under her breath.

Fast forward 10 minutes. Andre comes back, is happy that he gets a special cake and eats about half of it. That mini-cake was about twice size of a normal slice; that cake is very sweet, any more than the slice I had would've been too much for me, and keep in mind that I am essentially addicted to sugar.

After eating half of the cake, Andre goes off to dance with his friends. Dee goes to sit in his chair and takes another star decoration off it, then looks at me (I'm sitting right next to Andre at the table so I can see very well what she's doing), presumably to see if I was looking (I was looking at my phone, but still watched her from my peripherals). When she sees that I'm not looking, she eats a bit of cake that was left on his spoon. I call her out, asking her if she's eating with Andre's spoon. She says no and leaves.

A couple more minutes pass and she comes back in Andre's chair, takes her spoon and takes a bite of the cake. Then another. And another. At this point I stop her.

""Dee, did you ask Andre if he lets you eat his cake?""

""He didn't eat all of it.""

""It's still his.""

""He's going to the club.""

""At three. It's 2 o'clock right now. There's still an hour left.""

""So?""

""Go ask him for permission""

She does and comes back to me, telling me that he let her and takes another bite from the cake, then leaves.

Maybe I'm reading too much into this, maybe this is just normal 9-year-old behavior and I'm letting myself be influenced too much by this sub. I wouldn't know. She's the only kid I've interacted with in 2 years ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I think I did the right thing, but am I too harsh? I feel like I need a second opinion. Seeing that herself *and* her parents are obese, I am a bit worried. I recognize that behavior/impulse in myself, and since I am addicted to sugar (and to food possibly), that doesn't put me at ease.",Normal 9-year-old behavior or ham behavior?
fatpeoplestories,"This story is from way back, about a decade ago.

I was visiting colleges with my mom and we were spending the day at a university in the midwest that I’m still not sure wasn’t a stockyard

The tour ends and we decide to go to a local place for lunch.  We go to a Mexican place, which is always a tossup in the midwest.  The food is pretty average, not really that great.

And then they entered. 3 incredibly not-skinny land cows had escaped the farmer and found their way to the resturant.  I couldn’t tell if it was 2 kids and a mom, 3 sisters, or just 3 friends.  They all had this related but distantly-so look to them, and their bulbous physiques had long since removed any sort of identifying body features they once posessed.  I quietly prayed to Mantequilla that they would be seated in a different part of the dining room.

Nope!  They get placed at the booth directly behind ours so that the back of my head was basically right in the middle of their conversation.  It took a great amount of shuffling and effort to wedge themselves into the table, and there were grunts and complaints about how bad the seating was.

Then they all started to complain about the menu and how it had nothing they wanted.  Now, when I say this was a Mexican resturant, I mean that you could tell from across the street that it was a Mexican resturant.  There was nothing subtle, and no hidden innuendo that required decoding.  The building had an outlandish color scheme, and the name literally said “Cocina Mexicana” and a Spanish name.  And even to a person who had misplaced their glasses, the Meriachi band radio station that played at all times was another obvious giveaway.

What I’m saying is, they were very open and honest about the ethnicity of food you could reasonably expect to find in their menu.  I think Helen Keller could have figured it out.

Anyway, all 3 of them end up ordering the same thing: A hamburger.  And they complained about that too.  And that the srver was hard to understand.  And that they couldn’t read the menu.  And that the music was annoying.  And they used every foul work I knew of.  We basically quit eating and left asap.

The moral of the story is... there is no moral to this story.  Hamplanetry knows no bounds.  Protect those you care about.  Write to your loved ones before its too late.

fatpeoplestories,"TL;DR at bottom; this requires some SET UP

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, ayo--been lurking here and on fatlogic for a while. Gets me to wreck the thoughts that carried ~~me through~~ my (not chub but pretty nutritionally inept) self through highschool, which several ex-roommates of mine only exacerbated into my eventual 20lbs weight gain with their Weapons-Grade Fatlogic, Pseudo-Empowerment Horse Shit, and Thinly Veiled Excuses for Being Lazy as Fuck.

**Background**: I was freshly 18 and wanted to feel more independent and try living on my own. When my boyfriend's sibling, their partner, and their friend who lived in his late gram's house brought up the possibility of moving in together, I jumped. I was just starting college and wanted to have ""my own space,"" wanted to feel all \~grown up\~ and live with my boyfriend, and this value pack of 2 Hams and a Mini-Ham (who later became regular sized Ham) seemed to be the *perfect buddy pals to have my first independent living experience with!!!!*

*Narrator voice: She was wrong about this.*

Edit: Boyfriend is 2yrs older than me, these people are 7 years older than me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Our Cast of Characters for This and Any Other Story I Might Share:**

&gt;Me, **Srazzie**: (5""2, 117 lbs now, 140lbs living at this house. Young and impressionable because I was too trusting of the wrong people, and by this point, was already in a mental and emotional low due to my sanded-down self esteem thanks to living in this house and always being manipulated by these people.)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Boyfriend**: Boyfriend (5""8, 160lbs. Doing gen-eds and generally trying to avoid these fuckers because he never liked any of them and only moved for me smh poor lad)  
&gt;  
&gt;**FamilyHam**: Boyfriend's Sibling (5""8-9, 260-280? Always complaining about everything, insists they eat very very very little but still stays huge, Fat and Okay With It™)  
&gt;  
&gt;**AdultHam**: Friend who had his gran's house, oldest of us all (5""9, 240? Always just grunting and yelling his frustrations around the house regardless of whether or not polite society would consider screaming rude and unpleasant.)  
&gt;  
&gt;**GlutenFree**: AdultHam's partner (5""8? and decently slim before moving there some 6 months into this situation and having access to the gluten free bakery down the road. Celiac don't keep you thin with all these gosh darn gluten free cookies around.)

&amp;#x200B;

So, the story I tell you today is the turning point, the point I reached critical mass on their fatlogic and, in one swift motion, had the curtain of Weapons-Grade Fatlogic torn away.

\*Ahem\*:

One individual, FamilyHam's partner (who I shall call SkaterHam) was a recent inductee to the world of roller derby. They threw themselves into it with a *fury!* A *passion*, I tell you! They, approximately 270-280 lbs at perhaps 5""8, and the kind of person who blamed literally ANYONE ELSE ON THE PLANET for their shitty life and failed dreams except themselves. They decided that they would get into their *dream sport* and that they would do *whatever it takes to improve and succeed with the community of roller derby babes!*

Great! Exercise is good, goals are nice, fitness is cool! But this meant:

* starting the paleo diet
   * where they meal prepped for an entire day, used every single dish in the house, and then left it a giant disastrous mess when Boyfriend and I needed to make dinner because they were ""too tired"" after all that good cookin' to, you know, *clean their fucking shit*
* getting a gym membership
   * And going maybe twice a moon cycle
* seeing a nutritionist
   * Who told them, the Paleo Eater™, how many fucking \*fishy crackers they could eat in a day (\*our Neanderthal ancestors used to hunt those golden-gilled wonders in the frigid waters of Beetusland, don't you know!)
   * smh it doesn't take a nutritionist to tell you to stop eating half a pack of double stuffed oreos regularly
* coming home smelling like a 280lb gym locker and refusing to shower for like, hours
   * My fave was when they shoved their smelly ass wrist bracers in my face as a ""joke.""

But low and behold, one day, SkaterHam slipped, fell, and totally fucking decimated their ankle. Unfortunate, but also probably made worse by the fact that an extra 130lbs that didn't need to be there fell on it. Whatever. #feminism #bopo #fatandproud

So in the healing process of this ankle conundrum, SkaterHam is stuck in a wheelchair and can do basically nothing but eat, do child-esque crafts on the couch, and try to micromanage everyone from said couch because they like to feel in control of other people at all times. SkaterHam begins to eat quite a bit more than usual, and GlutenFree has recently discovered the gluten free cake mixes at Shaw's, meaning she would constantly buy them and just make a whole cake, cheap shitty frosting and all, every now and again for no reason and offer it to us all.

&gt;But hey! I see you took a bite; could you pay me back for the 0.83$ worth of ingredients that went into that bite? Also, can you wash all the dishes I used to make it? It's only fair uwu

Now, GlutenFree had made a cake and it was just as shit tier as you'd expect a half-assed Shaw's (gluten free!) box cake to be. It sat there on the stovetop, in the dark, dish-bombed kitchen, just begging to be eaten. I was about to go to bed, because I was a college kid working those early fast food hours for that good-good minimum wage. It was 11:30 PM I suppose, and the crew I lived with liked to stay up until like, 3-4 AM.

SkaterHam decided it was a good time to have a ~~delicate slice~~ straight-up *fifth* of the cake. It was served to them lovingly *without* a plate as they sat in their wheelchair, in the middle of the living room, wearing just a tank and shorts as people do at home.

I, passing through the dark kitchen after refilling my water glass, was returning to my room when I noticed the *size* of that fuckin slice. Y'all, it was bigger than their hand. And they were just fisting it in that Peter Pettigrew-looking maw.

I stood in wonder, shrouded in shadow and simply watching SkaterHam talk with mouthful of shitty box cake, shoveling more in all the while--and then, to my horror, saw the wall spackle these people called vanilla icing begin to give way between their fingers.

It slipped.

It thudded on their open chest, smearing crumb and spackle all over them.

It tumbled down their hammy frame, greasing their clothing as it made contact, then bounced off their knee and splatted on the living room floor.

&gt;I was already grimacing, thinking about how these fucks would probably leave the cake stain and crumbs on that nasty ass, perpetually cat fur and dirt-laden hardwood floor after tossing the piece away.

SkaterHam picked it up, to toss it away of course--oh. Oh, no.

No, not to toss: to continue shoveling it in their face between squeaky, pealing laughter (TEEHEE).

&amp;#x200B;

I've had this image burned into my fucking retinas for over a year now. I still don't think I did it justice, telling it this way, because it was a moment: just seeing someone that I suddenly realized I *never* wanted to be like (as our friendship was going quite sour by that point), and seeing them just... in such a fucking state of being. It's my motivator to literally never ever, in my life ever, let myself start slipping again.

&amp;#x200B;

(And yes, Boyfriend and I did get the fuck out of there eventually; tis how I stopped myself from also slowly becoming a ham.)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Ham starts roller derby and starts (but does not stick to) all the trappings of getting fit, such as ~~bombing the kitchen~~ starting a paleo diet, going to the gym (occasionally), and seeing a nutritionist. Ham breaks their ankle skating and starts eating more, and in this case, took a gigantic chunk of cake, which they then dropped and smeared all over themselves before letting it fall onto the very dirty floors. Then they picked it back up and kept eating it. Because cake.",The Moment the Curtain was Ripped From Mine Eyes [Long]

So reading all these stories on here has reminded me of my ex boyfriend. Normally I date people who are larger side I guess cause I like cuddles but this one really took the cake.

I'm not exactly secretive about my former eating disorder so obviously to someone that I'm dating my eating habits are a bit weird.

Normally this isn't an issue for people beyond them being concerned about me so I didn't think it would be an issue for this guy who seemed self-confident even though he was a bit on the larger side. Okay a lot on the larger side. Apparently I was wrong though at first he just asked me for diet advice and to help him stick to his diet which he was trying to cut out soda. I thought that was a good start so I supported him entirely including reminding him not to buy soda he asked me to keep him on track. 

However eventually he decided that I was being too controlling. Okay maybe I was so I decided to back off and not comment on his eating or soda drinking at all. So I thought things are going to be fine now on. Nope. We end up going getting into a discussion about food and our perception of food. It started out fine we are having a reasonable discussion about how I'm vegan and he is not. Which didn't go as horribly as you would expect. And then he comes out with this bit of intelligence. Apparently fruits and vegetables are bad for you I would take so many servings to get any actual nutrients that they are not worth eating. Also apparently the fact that they are low calorie, for the most part, is a bad thing. Which I guess is why he survived on Burger King and pizza, because more calories means it is healthier.

The fatlogic does not end there. One night I spend the night and he calls off work the next day so we spend all day together. It's about 2 in the afternoon and I'm happily surviving off zero calorie monster because that's the kind of person I am and he looks miserable for some reason. I asked him what's wrong and he says nothing, so trusting that someone in his 30s can be mature enough to be honest with his girlfriend I decide to drop it and continue gaming since that's what we were doing together. Then he randomly gets up and goes to the kitchen and microwave something. He comes back 5 minutes later with a disposable plate tortilla chips with melted cheese on top. Okay gross but whatever. He pouts while he eats this travesty and I tried to ignore him and continue gaming. Then later that night he gets upset with me. Apparently the fact that he knows about my former eating disorder means that he decided I would judge him for eating which I never have before and it took all his courage to eat those chips earlier. Please note because of my eating disorder I never comment on other people's food choices unless they specifically asked me to, because I know what that's like. 

I'm sitting there thinking, he is overweight and because he's scared I will judge him for what he's eating, he decides to eat something that unhealthy and completely devoid of nutrients. Yeah that makes sense. 

For the record that was the only time he apparently felt awkward eating in front of me. We would often go out to restaurants together and he wouldn't care that I only got a drink or two while he got a full meal that was extremely unhealthy most of the time. 

And like many fat people, he was aware of his weight problem. But of course it was everyone's fault except his own. And while when we started dating he said he wanted help losing weight, he never actually put any effort in. And this was despite having health issues that were related to being overweight, like a bad knee and difficulty sleeping. 

Oh well. He's apparently dating some overweight girl now so I guess they're good for each other. I guess every story can have a happy ending?",In which I date the poster child for fatlogic

Manager comes up to me after and says something along the lines of *""you know how.. larger people, can get when they're hungry. Don't let em get to you. Maybe at least acknowledge them next time?""* And all that about being more attentive to customers, basically saying we still have to serve assholes.

Still makese crack up the manager was instantly like, low key, *""try not to piss of fat people, they anger easily when hungry""*

It's also very memorable to me as the one time I *sort of* stood up to an asshole customer. I wasn't gonna say some shit and jeopardize my job, but damn was it satisfying to just be like *""nah""* to a rude bitch for the first time.

TL;DR: The planet Jupiter demands the garbage man bring her food at McDs. Manager tells me to beware around hangry fat people. I still think it's funny.","Yeah, of all people, you demand the janitor in the trash to get you food"
fatpeoplestories,"Some background: I work at a horse rescue and have made quite a few friends in the local horsey community. I have lost 49kg over the past year and started riding again, only casually but enough to hack out with friends and attend some local shows. This quick story features Showham and a heaping plate of fatlogic. Showham is about 1.6m tall and probably pushing at least 115kg.

I know Showham from local shows and she always has something to say when she sees me because I've lost more weight. Normally along the lines of how I can stop now (why thank you very much for giving me permission!) or asking how I'm doing it (and then saying she loves her bread and pasta and koeksisters too much to make herself miserable by trying to lose weight).

She does some jumping and cross-country and man, do I feel sorry for her horse. He's a tall, chunky warmblood but she's pushing the limit of what he can carry.

She had a nasty fall three weeks ago and can't ride until she's healed. Broken collarbone, plenty of bruises and some torn ligaments. Nobody else is allowed to ride her baaabyyyy so he's getting a rest as well.

I went to visit and see how they're doing and take some chicken soup and horse treats because they make everything better. She says she's putting on weight and can't understand why because ""isn't healing supposed to use up a lot of calories?"". I ignore it and comment that her horse is looking pretty good for being on rest.

""Oh, yes. He was getting fat and I cut his feed so he won't be fat when we start training again.""

She can understand CICO for her horse who doesn't need 7kg of concentrates daily now that he's not being ridden every day but can't understand why she can't lose weight!?

I pointed this out to her as diplomatically as I could but apparently it's different for her because she needs calories for her body to heal and besides, humans can go into starvation mode where they hold onto fat. When I asked about why the horse wouldn't go into starvation mode and gain fat, well that's apparently because animals don't have starvation mode. Only people. You can tell because animals without food always lose weight but people on diet often don't lose or gain it all back. I think that has more to do with people either not counting everything or miscalculating portion sizes but what do I know? 

I had a headache after trying to follow this logic so I left soon after. I swear if mental acrobatics burned calories she would be as thin as a whistle. ",How I learned that CICO does work. Only for animals though.
fatpeoplestories,"If you will indulge me, I want to talk some shit about Cousin Carnie's husband Harry. Partly because part of this will come up in the next chapter, but also because I hate everything about him! This chapter is a bit mean-spirited, but I feel no guilt over talking shit about this guy. He's awful. I tend to complain about him often; somehow I've developed some sort of Tourette's – any time someone gets me started on the topic of him (or an adjacent topic), I start ranting uncontrollably. I *hate* this guy.   
 

For some reason, Harry was born in the mid-1960s, and so was a young adult in the 1980s. Of all the style choices in life he could pick, he decided to model himself after Ron Jeremy (a chubby porn star from the 80s with shaggy, longish hair and a big mustache). Jeremy was known for having a very large dick and so my best guess is that Harry, hardy-har-har, thought if he reminded women of Jeremy, they might think he, too, had a large dick. 

&amp;#x200B;

(I'm going to guess he does not, but for the love of all that is holy, I refuse to try and picture him naked.)  
 

Even if that Ron Jeremy look was a hit in the 80s, I'm not sure why he stuck with it all these years, since it's kinda out of style now. Probably laziness.   


I met the two of them when Harry was in his mid-40s, and he's in his early 50s today. Harry is about 5'8"" and he was nearly, yet still under, 300 pounds when I first knew them (she mentioned his weight at one point), but has continued to put on weight since then.  He's a high school dropout, didn't get his GED, and he's a professional pizza delivery driver. He has three ex-wives, four ex-kids, and the name of one of those ex-wives still tattooed to his chest. His credit rating is somewhere in the neighborhood of -87 because he's never paid a bill he could get away with not paying. The guy didn't have $15 to his name and if he found $15 somewhere he'd spend it all on cigarettes or fast food before anyone could show up collecting on a bill. The only hobbies he seemed to have were sleeping, smoking cigarettes, and eating and I'm not just saying that to be snarky. The guy doesn't have much personality and doesn't have many topics of conversation to engage him with – not even the usual stuff like video games, movies, sports, or television programs. I've never known anyone else with such a bland personality and no real interests.   
 

And yet he still managed to find a fourth wife in Carnie. How this loser jackass kept finding women wanting to marry him is *far* beyond my comprehension. There was a line in the show Frasier from the 90s where Frasier laments that ""Murderers on death row can find women to marry them but I can't find one to sit through coffee with me!"" Exactly! I can only guess there are some women with just such low standards they simply don't think they can do any better.  
 

Carnie, being not terribly bright, felt she had a real catch in him.  In fact, she'd always talk about how much she loved that man and what a great guy he was. I don't know what she was basing it on because I couldn't figure it out. Occasionally she'd enjoy telling me what qualities my husband had that she felt were undesirable and how her husband was better because he wasn't like that. I guess it was that frenemies thing again. I was often too hard on her, and I guess she felt she needed some ways in which she could feel better than me. That's human, that's fine. I'm not even mad, only amused because her ""brags"" about her husband were so freakin' stupid!! Things like sports. My husband occasionally – but not obsessively – watches sports on TV. Well, Carnie had this idea that men watching sports was just terrible, a huge character flaw, the sign of a real asshole.  


Carnie, smugly: ""Harry doesn't watch any professional sports at all! In fact, Harry doesn’t even like sports at all!"" Of course not, Carnie, because the only sport he's ever participated in was competitive eating! Of course he has no interest in anything involving physical activity. No shock there.

  
She also saw beer bottles in my recycling and expressed her disapproval. ""Harry doesn't drink beer! I think beer breath is gross! And I wouldn't want him spending his money on beer!"" Carnie! Harry's a *chain smoker*!  What do you think *that* costs? Oh, you think ashtray tongue tastes so much better than beer breath? I beg to differ! And the crazy part is, my husband doesn't even drink that much beer! Maybe if my husband was a heavy drinker, I she'd have had a point.  And at least he recycles! lol  
 

Meanwhile…  


Carnie missed her family and friends back home and often talked wistfully of moving back. However, the reason they were living here and not in the state they were from had something to do with Harry's mountains of unpaid child support. I don't know the specifics of their home state, but Harry ""couldn't"" go back until the statute of limitations expired on his child support debt, least he face some consequences.  I guess maybe their home state might have revoked his driver's license or were threatening to throw him in jail or something.  


Apparently in certain states, the debt expires something like 10 years after the last child has reached maturity, so that was his goal. They were planning to move back in 2020, I think? but not before because they had to wait out this statute of limitations. (At least, that's what they believed, or at least that's how I think she explained it. They or I could be misunderstanding it.)

  
On one hand I felt a smidgen of sympathy – I can't imagine how rough it must be to be buried under so much debt that can't be charged off in bankruptcy (like child support, student loan debt, tax debt, etc). On the other hand, I'm not a real fan of deadbeat dads, and anyway, it's not like Harry was feeling overwhelmed by the mounting debt or felt bad about it. He literally didn't give a shit other than being annoyed. He just didn't want to deal with any *consequences* of his poor choices.   
 

In case you might have some smidgen of sympathy for him yet, just wait.   


As far as he was concerned, he had it all figured out, he'd outsmarted everyone! Why pay for child support for kids you don't even like anyway? Why visit your kids if the ex-wives were just gonna nag you? And if your kids hate you later on, just blame it on their bitch mothers turning them against you! *Nothing* is every your own fault! Why waste your money paying for health insurance when the ER has to treat you for free? Why bother to get a GED when no one even checks if you graduated from high school, and jobs ain't gonna pay you more for having one anyway? Why work hard to get a better job just to be in a new tax bracket and have to pay taxes and have people try to garnish your wages? This was Harry's Chronic Underachiever Success Plan!  


He was proud of how slick he was (but he often bitched if anyone else found some loophole and exploited it). He was just a lazy son-of-a-bitch who'd figured out early on that for someone like him with no real ambition or intelligence and a strong dislike of work, it simply didn’t ""pay"" to work hard, it was better to look for every scam and loophole and then justify it by bitching that other people were getting away with stuff, so why shouldn't he? He had no intention of ever doing the honest, ethical or responsible thing.

  
So what if you end up living in a dump? If your only hobbies are eating and napping, what do you care? So what if you end up living in the bad part of town? Just find some mean, mangy dogs to frighten the criminals and buy some guns. So what if you and you never have any fallback savings? There was always a new credit card offer in the mailbox or a rent-to-own place willing to sign a contract with you. So what if bill collectors might sue when you don't pay – as long as you own nothing outright, there's nothing to repo. Ha ha ha! #Winning!  
 

Sounds awfully depressing to me, but they seemed totally okay with it.  


God, I hate this guy.  


The obesity and smoking are catching up to him now. He won't take care of his health, doesn't have health insurance, and keeps landing in the hospital for heart troubles. But he isn't too worried about it because they can't make him pay the hospital bills, anyway! Haha! That's the rest of society's problem, right? When the doctors would stress to him he *must* change his lifestyle, he basically says fuck off, they don’t know him, they can't tell him what to do!   
 

But since he had no insurance, he couldn’t follow up with a primary care doctor or take his prescriptions, so he said he didn't care – it was all bullshit anyway. And again, to some extent I can sympathize – it's kinda f'd up that people can't afford to have insurance or go to the doctor or get their prescriptions. On the other hand, knowing Harry the way I do, even if he could have afforded insurance, he still wouldn't have, not if it meant he had to spend his own money. And even then, even if someone else (say the government) paid for insurance for him so he could get routine care, he still wasn't going to take care of himself. That would mean practicing delayed gratification – he'd have to change his diet, and he doesn't want to give up his greasy foods. He wouldn’t give up smoking, he damn well wouldn't start exercising, because none of it would be any fun.  
 

There is just no saving him from his own self-destructive nature.  
 

In the beginning, after he landed in the hospital the first time, he might have been a little concerned about his heart and lung problems, but not enough to change. And after four or five years of being in and out of the hospital, he seemed to have adopted the attitude of, ""Well, they keep telling me I'll die if I don't change my eating and exercise habits, but I'm still here, so clearly they are full of shit! Stupid doctors!!"" No, Harry, you're alive because you've been lucky to get to the hospital and be stabilized each time you were having a health crisis. You're alive because society is paying for your medical costs. Which is astounding since **you** don't even care about your health!!   
 

One time he said, ""Ah, who the hell cares! If I get sicker, I'll just go get on disability like everyone else and then I can retire! HaHaHaHaHa!"" I thought that was just a shitty joke, but it was true to Harry's attitude: mad that someone else was getting something he wasn't getting.  
 

(Wanna know what he's doing now? He's retired on SSDI – it wasn't a joke; it really was his plan all along.  He thinks he's SO slick that HE got to retire in his early 50s unlike other poor slobs, and they could finally move back to their home state since you can't force a guy on SSDI to make back child support payments #Winning!)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
At the time I was dealing with them,  his primary profession was pizza delivery driver, which he did on the weekends. Apparently he made pretty good cash tips doing this three days a week, enough so that nothing else could take priority on the weekends. At times he had other part time jobs during the week, but mostly preferred work that paid cash, presumably to avoid garnishments and taxes. (He didn't want to pay a damn bit to the government, especially since even if he didn't make much that year and had a refund coming, they'd just garnish it to pay off his debts.) 

  
But here is the part I needed to tell you because I want to reference it in the next chapter:  
   
His other part time job was working as a car mechanic at a tiny mom-n-pop shop. He didn't have any certifications to work on cars, but this wasn't a reputable shop so it didn't matter. They didn't care too much about worker protections or safety, but he didn't mind because he didn't care about that stuff, either. They paid him in cash which suited him just fine. During ""normal"" working hours (M-F, 9am to 5pm), they expected him to be ""on call."" When they got a customer, they'd call him to come to work, a few blocks from his house. They only paid him for the time he was *actually* working, though, yet supposedly expected him to be available on a moment's notice, so he claimed he couldn't work another job during the traditional work-week. This suited him just fine. If Carnie asked him to run errands while she was working he'd refuse. ""But Carnie, if they call me I have to rush right to work! What am I supposed to do if they call me while I'm in middle of (doing whatever errand)? Nope, sorry, no can do!""  His on-call job was the perfect excuse to be as *utterly lazy and useless as possible*, laying around the house and eating, napping or watching TV all day.   


Admittedly, maybe he couldn't find a better job, and yeah, it sounds like that job didn't treat him well, what with expecting him to be available but not paying him for those hours. I'll give him that. I just think he enjoyed the excuse too much. Example:  


 One day my phone rang:  
 

*Carnie: Could you go pick up some dog food for me?*  
**Me:** What??  
*Carnie: I'm on my way to work but I was out of dog food today and the dogs haven't eaten. I can't go get it or I'll be late for work!*  
 

(For whatever reason, I wasn't working this day and she knew I'd be home. I could have done this for her, but even if I didn't mind running an errand for her, I don't like her damn dogs. They are mean!)  
 

**Me:** I'm not going to feed your dogs for you, Carnie.  
*Carnie: Oh, no, you don't have to. Harry is at home! Just bring him the dog food, he'll pay you for it. He just can't leave the house because he's on call for work.*  
**Me:** You live two blocks from the grocery store. It's all the way across town for me! That's crazy. Tell him to just get off his ass and go. It'll take him seven minutes max.  
*Carnie: But he CAN'T!*  
**Me:** Yeah, I'm hanging up now, Carnie.

  
Yep. He was a real winner. No wonder he was such catnip to women and found **four** women to marry him. But apparently, he's catnip to the ladies!   
 

Just keep in mind how much free time he had hanging around the home when I come back with my favorite Carnie story.",Cousin Carnie [Part 8]: Husband Harry
fatpeoplestories,"Omg where has this subreddit been all my life..well the past year. I have so many stories about the guy who I share an office with I can fill a book. 

So I work armed security for the government. It is a great job, awesome benefits, pays well and best of all 3 12 hour shifts and that’s it. Four days off, cannot beat that. 

Anyway I am a former hamplanet, at one time I was almost 500 pounds. Thanks to my awesome best friends dad who is a former drill Sargent he helped coach me to shedding over 300 pounds in five years. Also my SO who helped push me as well. 

I am now 195 at six foot 2, I cycle six miles uphill to work and then six miles downhill home every day as well as keep a healthy diet and work out at a gym. I started my job a year ago and met my partner I will call Hamilton. Now to do this job you have to pass a physical, and a pt test. However to be honest, it isn’t exactly strenuous. Therefore we get some big boys and girls that squeak by on their tests. Hamilton is former military, Marines and at his peak he was probably 200 pounds of muscle on his six foot frame but Hamilton loves food. He is probably 280 now, and has a gut. Now the way our job is we sit in a office watching cameras for half the shift while the other does foot patrol and patrols in a golf cart around the facility. 

If you guessed that Hamilton sits in the golf cart all the time instead of patrolling on foot you would be right. He also is constantly snacking he blames it on his fast metabolism.. whatever you say hamilton. 

Anyway I normally pack a cooler full of my food, sometimes my SO packs my cooler and she will make me homemade trail mix or a special treat.   One day she packed me a small little baggie of atomic fire balls thats my weakness i love them.

I occasionally will offer Hamilton a handful of something to be polite. However this day i was not going to share my fireballs. It was my turn to do the foot patrol/ golfcart part of my shift so I left our office. 
When i got back to get my cooler for lunch Hamilton’s face was bright red, like a tomato. He was covered in sweat and he was chugging his bottle of sweet tea.
Im thinking the dude is having a heart attack and then i see the wrapper. Dude grabbed a atomic fireball out of my bag. He is practically weeping, “how can you eat those it burnt my mouth.”

Needless to say he was wary for a long time about messing with my food.  ",My mouth is on fire!!

*miniplanet* &amp; Weightlossham (me) have the same stats *we're both 5"" 4' (162 cm)* and both are overweight at that time with 170 lbs (77kg) which gives us a *BMI of 29.3 (upper end of overweight and almost obese)* I lost 13 kg and lost another 3 since the holidays

I went on holiday with a good friend (Miniplanet) and there were several fat logic moments which I wanted to shareSo obviously I was watching what I was eating during the stay.

(this got a lot longer than intended)

**Through our journey** to our destination miniplanet tells me *she wants to lose weight &amp; seems to struggle* (she got a dog in March and goes for walks in mornings and evenings and is standing pretty much all day long at her job but still didn't lose a single gramm)

I give her a few recommendations (because she asked).

On the **second day** Miniplanet &amp; I go to a restaurant for lunch. Actually we wanted to order a milk shake there because they just looked really lovely but we ended up being really hungry so we decided we go for lunch. I order a salad with chicken sticks. *She orders Spaghetti carbonara.* The plates were HUGE and filled up. I tried a bit of her pasta which was cream and cheese overload. Of course she ate it all even though she seemed to be full during half the plate. She didn't say anything about weight loss that day so well.. okay ... still she ate through my entire daily intake of calories in just one sitting and complains often about struggeling to lose weight.

Later the day I got a terrible headache and we go to a pharmacy because I didn't bring any painkillers. *I joke about the weight loss aid section (which tries to sell ""wonderpills"") she jokes with me*. (Not important for now but keep that in mind since it is important for later)

*Miniplanet wants to grab some McD for dinner*. Which upset me a bit because we were in a place where eating out was much cheaper than in our home country and we could have gotten healthier food still cheap in comparison to my home.. but I accepted.

**Day Three**

Miniplanet and me are both tired from all the walking went to eat early dinner. After dinner *Miniplanet suggests we could just buy some snacks and watch a movie*. Good for me. We enter the store. I grab some celery sticks and rice waffles since I spent a lot of my calories already on this day (same as her). *She comes around the corner with two giant chocolate-filled donuts and a big pack of chocolate-covered chocolate cookies and a sugary energy drink.*

....

Okay.

While we watch the movie *she eats a donut and half the pack of cookies*. I eat a few celery sticks and a bit of the rice waffles.

**Day four**

*Miniplanet eats the other half pack of cookies and the second donut for breakfast* (it was 11:00) while I ate a celery stick.

We wander around the city and *in the evening she wants to go AGAIN to McD* \*sigh\* I order a small McChicken menu and leave half of the bun and at least 1/3 of my fries.

*She orders a big portion of nuggets and fries and eats my leftover fries as well.*

For dinner we went into a steakhouse. I ordered a small steak medium-rare with mushrooms. She ordered the same but with *fries.*sure why not eating fries once in a while....

**Day five**

We were going to the airport to go home. At the airport *we drink a milkshake* (at this day I ate too much as well but I was definitely aware of that) we go into the Pharmacy/Grocery store(?) You could get sandwiches and drinks there as well.. we see again the weightloss section. *She walks towards it and tells me she wants to buy those ""magic pills""* ... I tell her that there is no magic pill to weight loss.. Luckily they were out of stock..

The funniest part about it all was that *she turned to me at the airport and was like ""we ate soooo much the last few days""* to which I though ""actually it was YOU eating SOOOOOO much"" but by the amount she consumed during our stay i'd say she would be fatter if she'd eat like that all the time so probably she was just like ""meh f\* it.. it's holidays..."" but still.

outcome: i lost 1 kg during our stay while *she... gained nothing (according to herself)*

I'm happy that she knows she should lose weight but very unhappy with her choices. And sad that she doesn't believe me that there's nothing like a magic pill to lose all the weight one gains over (usually) years of overeating

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr:** Miniplanet eats a lot on holiday but complains about not losing weight and searching weight loss wonder pills as a solution for her problem

However she is a serial, failed dieter, and is about 250lbs at 5'3"". I have never seen her close to a healthy weight, and she's getting to the age where I'm very concerned about her health .

Last night we had a family dinner which involves most of my extended family going out to eat(about 20 of us). And my aunt was talking all about how much she loves the new Weight Watchers because apparently a lot of foods are 0 points now. She was talking about how she had 5 apples as a snack, and it was 0 points. She ordered a salad with chicken because the chicken is 0 points. Yet she was saying that she's not lost any weight this week... I pointed out that an apple has around 100cal, so her snack was 500cal. ""It's not about calories though! You'll lose weight just by eating unprocessed foods!"" Of course all my other overweight relatives tittered and agreed with this... and yet I'm the only person at the dinner who has lost weight(60lbs) and kept it off for a year. 

By WW points my entire diet(WFPB vegan) is basically no points... and I can definitely pack on the pounds if I'm not careful. What upsets me is that these programs changed to embrace fatlogic, don't teach sustainable  methods for health eating and portion sizes, and perfectly kind, wonderful people who I very much want to live long healthy lives are being strung along.

fatpeoplestories,"Hello everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing as it's Lunar New Year in a couple days time I'd like to share a snippet of the lovely Thirstyham's antics a year ago involving beetus filled goodies. For some background, these treats are often served as snacks for guests in this part of the world during the Lunar New Year period, and a vast amount of them are really unhealthy. Think pineapple jam tarts, crisps made from arrowroot, prawn crackers, bak kwa (think jerky made from pork or chicken, glazed in a sugary sauce and grilled on the barbecue) and the now very popular salted egg flavoured crisps.

&amp;#x200B;

So my former workplace was actually pretty relaxed in terms of having snacks around, as long as your beetus fuel remained in a sealed container and you behaved like an actual human being by not leaving vermin attracting crumbs all over the place. As my desk was located in a a cluster of workstations known as ""The Corner of Sighs"", there was a modest morale building stash on one of the empty desks come the fortnight before the New Year.  It didn't do much as within the next 6 months, 90% of the denizens of ""The Corner of Sighs"" had left (including myself, but that's for another day)

&amp;#x200B;

Before I continue, here's an introduction to those involved:

* Thirstyham (TH) - 33F, 100kg, 165cm. Dreams of Prince Charming but alas self sabotages via a lethal combination of unrealistic standards, fatlogic and being creepy.
* Banmian (me) - 28F, 65kg, 160cm. New to the office, already wishing she could go back to the madness of hospital life.
* Lisa - 35F, 60kg, 180cm. All round lovable person, plans to escape and explore the world. Enjoys running and cat memes.
* Ruby - 28F, 55kg, 165cm. Quiet, hardworking mum. Loves tea.
* Dave - 40M, slightly tubby, 178cm. Fabulously flamboyant. Talents underutilised in this place, also making escape plans. Lisa and Ruby's boss, very protective of his team.
* Sammy - 26M, 75kg, 183cm. Fitness enthusiast. Most relaxed guy I know, every so often mouths ""Fuck this shit"" i.e. putting our sentiments into words.
* Mike - 45M, fat non-ham, 175cm. Foodie, fun guy and loves dirty jokes outside of office hours. Making steps to get healthier via home cooking and starting to train with Sammy
* And of course a cameo by Crazy Bint (CB), my boss. Late 40s to early 50s, 150cm, spherical shaped. Not a typical ham but vicious in her own way. The memory of her sends a shudder down my spine to this day.

Let's resume storytime!

&amp;#x200B;

It was Dave's idea to start the mini stash at one of the empty desks (otherwise piled with folders) for morale building. Each of us would contribute a packaged snack (healthy-ish please) in order to partake from the rest of the collection, and it was understood it was a thing between the Corner and of course any friends we'd allow to partake of the stash. So far so good, even Sammy and Mike who were not officially part of the Corner put in something to walk away with some of Ruby's sour plums or Lisa's biltong.

&amp;#x200B;

Then one day Dave, Mike and I decided to bring in those once a year treats for the Corner and the main pantry's snack collection. Dave would bring wafers, Mike agreed to bring in peanut cookies that were his neighbour's specialty and I would bring pineapple tarts from a famous bakery, along with some salted egg crisps (still can't stand those things, sorry my fellow countrymen and neighbours) given by my landlady. 2 containers of each calorific treat were brought in by each of us: a large one for the main pantry as the office is huge, and a much smaller one for the Corner. Lisa was thrilled with the salted egg crisps much to my surprise, but hey am glad to see someone enjoy something I brought in. We thought that should tide us over for the next couple of weeks... OH BOY were we wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

The first clue that something was amiss was other colleagues asking within the same day if there were any pineapple tarts left in the pantry. Okay NBD, that's why I stored another jar of pineappley goodness in the cupboards for the pantry in case this happened. The cupboards were under lock and key by the office manager so the spare containers of artery clogging goodness were brought out and the contents devoured over the course of a few days. Soon after, Dave and Lisa noticed a rapid decline in our morale stash, particularly the peanut gut bombs from Mike and the pineapple tarts. We joked that it was probably stress eating on our part, chided ourselves for bad behaviour and went on with our day. That afternoon, the Corner of Sighs had external engagements - Dave, Lisa and Ruby to a meeting, whilst I joined CB to another meeting. Later that afternoon Lisa, Ruby and I returned to the office to write up minutes and reports, hoping that we'd finish in time for Ruby to tuck in her little boy.

&amp;#x200B;

As we walked into the office there were few people left at 6pm. What we saw though, was the large round shadow of TH crouched over the morale stash, helping herself to the crisps and wafers, licking fingers before grabbing another mouthful. The empty jar of pineapple tarts lay sadly on the table. As I walked past TH's desk, I saw what looked suspiciously like the jar of Mike's peanut cookies perched next to her monitor. Before we could say anything, TH stood up without an ounce of shame and yelled across the nearly empty office...

&gt;TH: ""Those chips are amazing guys! No wonder you guys wanted to keep it to yourselves, but there should be enough left!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Lisa: *Internally screaming ""OMGWTFBBQ bitch you just contaminated everything""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Ruby: *Sighs louder than usual, then puts on a sweet smile* ""TH, there was a large pack in the pantry. Has it already been finished?""  
&gt;  
&gt;TH: *Red-faced from embarrassment at being caught red-handed with no possible way to defend herself* ""Yes I finished it but I was still hungry! I've been going to the gym so I need more calories to keep up!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Lisa: *Tries not to roll eyes* ""Hey TH, if you want a snack or anything just feel free to ask us okay? You know how Dave is with these things""  
&gt;  
&gt;TH: *Glowers at Lisa whilst probably doing intense mental gymnastics over how Lisa and Ruby are anorexic and need feeding up and that Dave will take the side of his crew no matter what* ""Okay, fine.""

TH then shuffles back to her desk, packs up and heads home. Without washing her hands.

&gt;Me: O.o  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ""I say we get rid of the contaminated stuff?""  
&gt;  
&gt;Lisa and Ruby: *Slow nods, faces still shocked* ""Yep, let's get rid of it""

&amp;#x200B;

We binned the contaminated snacks and empty containers, wiped down the desk with disinfectant wipes. We worked in silence until about 7.30-8pm and headed home, too exhausted and shocked to say anything\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning, I get a text from Mike.

&gt;\*Insert photo of stolen cookie jar on TH's desk\*  
&gt;  
&gt;Mike: OMG what is this doing on her desk!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Morale in my old workplace is shitty, colleague starts healthy-ish snack corner for morale. Has unhealthy snacks accepted temporarily for Lunar New Year, along with much larger contributions of same beetus fuel to main pantry's Beetus Collection. Ham depletes Beetus Collection in main pantry, eats and contaminates snacks in the corner whilst probably stealing a half eaten jar of cookies.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Lisa and I did laugh over it over coffee months later, after we escaped to find true happiness.

&amp;#x200B;",Thirstyham's New Year snacks
fatpeoplestories,"To start, I am an EMT so I staff an amulance. About a year ago I conquered my depression which made me have no appetite and began vigorously eating. In short, I'm now sixty pounds overweight and finally decided I needed to do something about it. I restrict to about 1200 calories a day because driving an ambulance is far less active than one might think, and usually save those calories for dinner and a dessert. So on my day shift I don't eat, I just drink water with mixed in electrolytes.

I did not realize that it was going to be TERRIBLE to diet around my coworkers. Crabs in a bucket 100%.

Alongside my normal shift I work a lot of extra shifts so I have had multiple medics as partners so here is a few of my experiences trying to diet around my coworkers.

1. My normal partner called in and I was paired with an obese lady we'll call Kate. Lunch time hit and Kate asked me to pick a fast food place to stop and eat lunch. Once we got there I decided to go inside with her because I was extremely sick of drinking water and thought a diet coke could bring back my resolve. Kate orders first and orders a large combo and asks for no salt on anything. I order after and since she is still putting away her change she hears me order just a diet coke.

She asks me if I'm on a diet and I gave her a quick run down of how I was restricting. Kate then tells me ""you're doing it completely wrong, if you starve yourself under 2000 calories then everytime you eat dinner it just gets stored immediately. You should try my diet."" Willing to humor anything I then asked her exactly what her diet was. ""My doctor said I would be sure to lose weight if I cut out the extra salt, so now I just eat like normal and just get it without salt!"" I asked her what about the sodium processed into the food since I was pretty sure all the food she ordered had a shit ton of sodium in it."" Oh that doesn't count! He just said extra salt! So like the salt they add to the fries after they come out."" I thanked her for the advice and kept drinking my diet coke.

2. I rode with an extremely obese male medic. Like fupa getting bounced on his knees kind of obese. I actually had issues fitting into the back of the ambulance with him to help do vitals because he would spread his legs as wide as possible so his fupa could rest on the seat and not put pressure on his thighs. We'll call him Charles.

Charles asked me to stop at this very popular barbecue joint for lunch and I agreed. He got confused when I didn't get out of the ambulance when we stopped and I jokingly waved my water bottle and told him I had lunch already. He huffed and went to order TWO plastic bags of food. He then relentlessly made fun of me drinking water for the rest of the shift. ""Is that water everything you hoped for?"" ""Look I'm not even going to eat this side of rice because you inspired me with your diet."" ""I hope I don't need you to help me with a patient because you'll snap in two with your twig self!""

I kindly request not to partner with Charles anymore.

3. My last story is riding with a female medic we'll call Cassidy. Cassidy was far shorter than me so even though we were actually almost the same weight, she looked a good bit... Rounder. 

Of course none of that was fat! She talked at me the entire shift talking about how she was the ""peak of fitness"" and ""trained endlessly"" for this job so that she never needed a man to help her lift patients. She carried an entire backpack filled with nothing but snacks and packed lunches but of course she needed it as ""fuel"" for the amount of muscle she was carrying.

So color me surprised when we went to lift an obese patient and it took three tries because Cassidy could only move her two or three inches with each pull before having to take a break to huff and puff. She told me it was just because she had already worked four days in a row and missed dinner the night before.

Thank you for reading this far guys! I won't even get into the patients or the nurses whose fat logic I get to deal with. Ems is just a motherlode of these stories.",My EMS partners get annoyed by my diet
fatpeoplestories,"My workplace is full with fat people, one just had a quadruple bypass and has been WOKE to working out now. He walks around on lunch now to lose weight which I’m happy for. This got me thinking I should help promote some fitness. I asked around and proposed a push-up contest around the office and some of the guys liked the idea. So I said great and dropped down to crank a few out. I got to about 10 before the bigger folks stopped their work and started saying “What are you doing this is a work place! HR, HR!” So I stopped and was baffled that pushups are so bad. I’m now doing them in the board room away from people but what saddens me is the people who were interested don’t want to do it anymore out of fear. I’m still going to ask them to come with and do them in private though. Not sure if I should still do them around people or not..",People at work hate pushups?
fatpeoplestories,"So to follow on from a post I made here a few months back, I thought I'd throw up a... what's the word for a group of hams? Like a murder of crows, or a school of fish. Let's call it a glutton of hams. Or, more specifically, a glutton of hamservations.

It's been a bit since I've encountered them all, so some small location details might be off, but I'll try to be as accurate as possible.

Here we go:

Stockholm, late spring. Enjoying a morning stroll around the waterfront, only care is finding a place to have some breakfast that isnt overrun. My headphones bit it a while ago, so I'm back to enjoying the sounds of the city instead of the isolation they provided, when I hear the by now almost cliche sound of impending death and/or hilarity. Wheeze. Scrape. Wheeze. Curiosity gets the best of me, and it ain't like I have plans, so I slow down enough to have them shuffle past me. 

5'nothing, wider than she is tall, what I would call an extra-hard 40 and already on a walker. Flanked by a tall, impossibly lanky kid and a nondescript third party. Rough, but nature makes fools of us all, time to head on by and-

""I dawnt get it! Ya saw me, I never order extra fries, yet you keep skinny and I don't!"" 

Well fuck. Not only do we have a ham, but one blubbering loudly in the most scraping... midwest-south accent. In the middle of goddamn Stockholm. I only hear her, as the kid and the third party all speak at normal volume, and I'm not going to get up close to eavesdrop.

""Yeah but them's good carbs! Now where are we going, you know I cant go too far!""

Ok. Now I'm captivated. And hungry. Let's see where they go. A couple frustrated exclamations and about two dozen wheezes later, our motley group makes it to the middle of the next block, to some hotel's restaurant. Place is empty enough and has a gorgeous view of the harbor from the outdoor seats, so hey. A view and a show? Sign me up. The group gets a table inside, I grab a seat outdoors and get lost in my own gastronomic desires for a while. I am a curious creep though, so once in a while I glance inside, see how our group is surviving in the land of inhumanely tiny portion sizes (can I get a BULLSHIT! From the crowd?)

Well, I never saw her order extra fries, that's true. The three different sandwiches, topped off with some kind of custard bowl made up for that, though. The other two picked at something salad-y the whole time. By the time I walked away after thoroughly enjoying some version of eggs and stretching out a couple drinks, she was still stuck in, I counted 6 plates on the table. Good thing for no extra fries, though. Only bad carbs there.

A few ham-free weeks pass, and I'm now in Vienna. Its turning into a rather hot and rainy summer, but I'm in the capital of classical music, centuries-old metropolitan cafes, and a surprising amount of pop-up cocktail bars. 

It is in one of these cafes, dripping with history and a very specific kind of reserved grandeur, that we have our next sighting. People are talking, but the sound never rises above a low murmur. The door opens and closes with a soft whoosh. I'm sitting in my favorite spot, on a red leather sofa in the corner of the shop, working my way through a coffee and a piece of chocolate cake decorated with gold leaf, when all of a sudden, the door slams wide open. Ripped out of my semi-meditative state, I am now paying acute attention to the culprits, my fellow countrymen.

""They better have some Real Food in this one, I'm tired of looking at stupid menus!"" Bellows the shorter one.

Now I'm sure all eyes are on this lovely pair, and not just because they're bending light around their massive figures. Without saying another word, they stomp over to the table in the center of the cafe and descend on chairs that look to have survived decades of use, but are now creaking and desperately trying to contain these invaders without getting sucked into their nether regions.

The murmur picks back up, and it seems like all is well once again, until it's time to order. Once again, a showstopping roar emerges, only now centered in the cafe, so the stone walls echo it perfectly to everyone.

""Do you have fries!?""

""Good! We'll take two! And that chocolate cake!""

A quick aside here. That chocolate cake is a piece of decadent heaven. It is served in small slices, and is filling/sweet to the point that it is more than enough for a normal person's breakfast and lunch put together. You see where this is heading. 

They get their fries and sandwiches, and seem satisfied for a time. It's quite a bit louder in the cafe, but everything is almost back to normal.

""Excuse me! What is this?!"" Again the bellow pierces the cafe. The larger one is pointing at the two pieces of chocolate cream heaven perched on the table. ""I said we'll take it! No need for samples!"" If I could sink deep enough into the cushions to hide my nationality, I would. 

I had a couple more, but my memory is failing me at the moment. Safe to say, the hamcurse was strong with me last year.
",Hams out of place
fatpeoplestories,"Since the other incidents, I’ve been very distant with her, going as far as straight up telling her that I feel disgusted when she touches me. She still won’t stop being an asshole.

I was in the library &amp; she sat next to me, took photos of me to put on her snapchat story (although I’ve said to her before that I don’t like having my photo taken in general and I’d prefer it if strangers didn’t get any information about me). If that wasn’t bad enough, she pointed to a display on childhood obesity and told me, “You should read those!” I know she meant it as a joke but she got so upset when I replied with, “Yeah, maybe we could read them together seeing as we both need them.” 

She ranted in about how I wasn’t being a good friend &amp; how I shouldn’t make fun of her for her weight issues since mine are worse... not being funny but she’s visibly three times my size, it’s not hard to see whose weight issues are worse. 

Her smell also bothers me &amp; it’s not certain that her weight causes it but it’s probably a factor. She sat next to me in the psychology lesson we had before lunch and kept leaning her head against my arm, I got sick of her after I’d leaned away a few times and she kept getting closer. I whipped my arm out from under her &amp; her head slammed on the desk, kinda mean, very funny. She glared at me but to be honest I don’t even feel bad because I’ve told her before that I hate being touched and that her specifically touching me made me feel disgusted. 

She just never gets the message when people have issues with her. Yeah, her weight might be her parents’ fault since she’s only sixteen, but her not being able to respect personal boundaries even after multiple warnings is all her own fault - so is the fact that she constantly points out when someone looks above average weight but gets angry if anyone so much as looks at her funny. 

I’m thinking I’ll just go to security because at this point I’ve told her on many occasions that I want her to leave me alone and she still follows me around campus, going everywhere I go. She only leaves me alone if I walk into the city because it’s up a big hill, but I don’t want to have to do that every time I want some peace.",Update on the Obese Classmate who Bullies Others
fatpeoplestories,"So I mentioned the fatty from my previous story who threw a fit about the ice box. Here's one about a different fatty from the same place who is too lazy to even pay attention to where she was supposed to go.

So I'll start off by saying this tub of lard is one of those short round balls of blubber. She decides to wear leopard print all the time. It's disgusting because it's the tight fitting shirts that clearly are too small. I try to avoid looking at her but it's hard because the spectacle she makes pushing her rolly walker thing as she  goes to the lobby, sits down for 20 minutes, babbles about retarded shit. I intentionally troll her in the most professional way I can.

This story is about my first run-in with tons-of-not-fun.

We're having a big meeting for the corporate side of the client's security team and our company's account manager for this national account. Important people who are meeting with the regional new people to tell them what's expected and essentially a raw-raw meeting combined with training.

I'm pulling a double because half the staff at our site is new and is required to go. I'm tired, it's 8 in the morning and I've been there since 7pm the previous day. Not really in the mood for shit to be honest.

I'm walking the head guy from the client side to the conference room. We're talking and having a nice little chat. Suddenly when we open the door to the call center floor, right there in an unoccupied desk if the Leopard Lardess herself. Don't get me wrong here, a lot of people dress horribly tacky in a call center. I have to wear a suit and tie and I like it. When I wear gloves in the winter I imagine I'm Agent 47 but not bald.

It's not the dress of her that is disgusting, it's her immediate demand to know where the new people are supposed to go. Well here's a little trouble with all of this.

1.) We don't know because security isn't told this shit. We simply guard the building. The inner workings of the company are inconsequential. We're more concerned with doors not being locked and people not having badges.

2.) She openly admits they showed her but she forgot. You're a grown adult, you are expected to remember where to go for your job.

3.)She's sprawled out on a chair like a cleofatra and expects that I'm going to jump at helping her.

I tell her to hang on while I show this person to the conference room they are heading to.

He's trying to not laugh at her protesting about how she's gonna be late to work in that obnoxious weezing that comes from fatty jowls. Anyone who has dealt with the severely morbidly obese...ah hell, everyone here, right? It's more annoying than when you go hog hunting and you get one but it doesn't die right away so you hear that ungodly screeching they make.

I simply hold up a hand to shut Shamu up and show the guy to the place. I come back and I'm trying to be professional and polite and also point out that they showed her so to ""jog"" her memory I ask her what department she's in. She mutters general customer intake.

Essentially these are the scrubs who do the bitch work for the company. They are in and out all the time because the other departments require skills and degrees so we tend not to have a problem with them on stupid shit like this. I tend to not bother learning who they are because they rarely stay very long.

I tell her it's upstairs and to the right. As soon as I say stairs, fatty is going full hippo aggro.

""I hate stairs! I can't go upstairs!!!! Blah blah blah, my walker doesn't let me go upstairs!!!""

Seriously, it's like dealing with Cartman but with a vagina and none of the cunning/intelligence that fatty has.

""There's an elevator. It's in the main lobby.""

She huffs like I should have mentioned that earlier. Struggling to get her large self from the chair, she grunts and generates the kind of noises that make you think you're seeing a National Geographic special on the mating habits of warthogs. Smelled like one too.

She grumbles as she has to walk down a hallway that is barely 20 meters long, if that. She gets to the elevator but grumbles that we should have signs to the elevator.

I shrug and half-assly reply ""Oh I'll definitely mention that to my boss."" In a tone that is clearly sarcastic and backhanded.

It sadly isn't my last time dealing with this pain in the ass. Every time she comes in from the parking lot, she demands to sit in one of our chairs at our desks as we are doing paperwork or reviewing something like logs or camera footage. I've explained to her that we are busy and need to do things and to use the main lobby for an empty couch.

The entitlement of some fatties is amazing. I think Fat Acceptance has made them think we should feel bad they stuff their faces stupid to the point of being nigh immobile.",Leopard clad Lardo (or is it Lardess?) proves that elephants can indeed forget.
fatpeoplestories,"Hello everyone! My first time posting here after lurking for a while... so feedback and constructive criticism encouraged :)

&amp;#x200B;

So here's some background. I have worked in healthcare for about 4 years and in the first half of 2018 I did a stint in an office role after having heard about how amazing it was from colleagues who have done the same. Location was great, plenty of lunch options and I made some great friends (who I will introduce in further stories). It was also during this period of time I succumbed to a toxic work culture, ballooned from 65kg to my highest ever weight 85kg (at a height of 160cm, that means my BMI was 33.2) and was a miserable excuse of a human being. In that office, I met this lady whom I shall refer to as ThirstyHam (TH) who was 34, 165cm and about 95-100kg when we first met. She had a penchant for thick makeup, cleavage and generally being really nosy regarding peoples romantic lives.

&amp;#x200B;

For all her hammy behaviour and fatlogic she exhibited over the time I knew her, TH was the one who introduced me to her gym and I'll forever be grateful for that. She had been going to this particular gym for a year when I expressed interest in getting my shit together in early June. So she lets me tag along on a Friday evening hoping to introduce me to her regular dance class with the ""super hot Brazilian instructor, you'll love it!"". Instead I decided to sign up for personal training with a strength and conditioning coach who I shall refer to as Manny (33M, 175cm, 80kg buff and tattooed). We drew up a workout and diet plan, established goals. Manny and I parted ways with a ""see you Saturday morning bro"". So far so good. I even brushed off her texts of ""why didn't you choose a cuter trainer"" and ""they should give me free membership now"" as her being jokey.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next 5-6 months life continued to get better from my end. I started therapy. My weight dropped from 85kg in June to a much stronger 74kg at the end of November (CW 70kg), well on my way to my goal of a strong 55kg. Bloodwork improved, managed to reverse that high cholesterol. Left the toxic workplace and moved to a good hospital where I was often exhausted but came out safer, smarter. For the first time in 10 years, I was becoming happier.

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime, TH was lurking in the background. Still in the same classes she had been going to (dance, spin, I don't know what else) and despite her experience refusing to go beyond beginner level. She'd moan to me about not losing weight, but would be like ""Well, I'm only exercising so I can eat whatever I want! I'm craving cookies SOOOO MUCH"" then would proceed to send me a picture of her hand holding a chocolate chip cookie that was the size of 2 fists and probably at least 800kcal. With the caption ""Who needs guys eh?"". Let me tell you folks, it was well known in my former workplace that TH was, and still is actively yearning for love but sabotages herself by refusing to sign up for online dating or declining blind dates for fear of the guy being a psycho or too ugly. At that point I just shrugged and let TH be TH.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometime in August, whilst I was doing some post circuit LISS cardio my phone went off:

&gt;TH: Hey Banmian, do you know anything about that guy who was training next to you?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Uhh not really, he's one of the other trainers I guess. Why?

I really didn't know who as it was a busy evening and there were several guys around the training area. Anyways...

&gt;TH: Oh he's exactly my type but I'm a bit shy. Can you get his number for me?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I don't think that's a good idea as we don't know each other. Besides am not sure which one you're referring to. Point out to me next time you're in?  
&gt;  
&gt;TH: Oh fine. Yeah I will. I've been watching him work out and train his clients, I don't want to distract him with my youth and beauty!

I swore I could have heard a ""tee-hee"" at the end but I was tired and on call the next day so didn't overthink it.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 2 days later. I was post call on a Friday so did my workout just before lunch and went to bed. 7pm my phone buzzes.

&gt;TH: This is him!

She has sent me a photo obviously taken from the spin studio, featuring another trainer whom I shall call Thor Jimin (TJ) 23M, 178cm, with the face of BTS's Jimin and the body of Chris Hemsworth. He was training his usual 7pm client. Before I could ask her why the hell she was perving on gym staff when she should be cycling, I get another picture. Of TJ's trainer profile.

&gt;TH: So handsome, right?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Uhm why are you sending me photos when you should be spinning? LOL  
&gt;  
&gt;TH: So are you going to get his number for me? You'd better not try to take him for yourself!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ...  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Why don't you ask him yourself? I really don't know him.  
&gt;  
&gt;TH: But you talk to him sometimes! You're friends with him aren't you???

BTW, saying ""Hi"", ""Bye"" and ""Bro, you done with this?"" does not a friendship or relationship make. It's just being a decent human being who wipes down equipment and reracks the weights. I brushed her off by saying something along the lines of probably introducing them at some point, then went back to bed. Woke up to this:

&gt;TH: I can't wait to see TJ on Monday! I don't think you need to introduce us, am sure he'll fall for me as I'm gorgeous and am just his type! Am sure he'll appreciate my curves and my personality, see he likes girls who are a little lazy and enjoy Netflix in bed!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Wait a minute, how did you know this???  
&gt;  
&gt;TH: I saw it on his Facebook! Look!!!

Cue screenshot of what looks like this guy's page with some cheesy meme about his ideal girl... but that didn't disturb me. What disturbed me was that she found him on Facebook. She took the effort to ~~stalk~~ find him on fucking Facebook guys. Sigh. I typed a reply as I prepared to go to work at 6am on a Saturday morning.

&gt;Me: Well I guess you can go say hi to him then, let me know how it goes.

The weekend otherwise went really well. I discovered I had dropped another kilo and made some strength gains (broke my first deadlift PR, t'was a puny 60kg). Also for once my boss wasn't on the verge of a nervous breakdown during the weekend morning shift.

&amp;#x200B;

Monday 8pm rolls round. I was on the train home, relieved after training back and shoulders. Phone buzzes. It's TH.

&gt;TH: I DON'T WANT HIM ANYMORE! I WASTED 4 WEEKS OF MY LIFE, AM SO HEARTBROKEN  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Whoa whoa, what happened? Was he mean? Do you wanna talk about it?  
&gt;  
&gt;TH: I didn't talk to him but I overheard him speaking to someone and I hate his accent! What am I going to do, I'm never going to find love and will die alone 😭😭😭😭😭  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ...

Truth be told, homeboy has a regional accent but nothing too offensive or obvious. We are in a pretty cosmopolitan city so it's not unusual to hear accents and languages from all over the world. I comfort her as much as I could over text and suggest perhaps she go on dates with guys introduced by friends or colleagues, of course I get shot down.

&gt;TH: But normal guys are never good enough! They are either rude, not handsome and they don't appreciate a good woman even if she was right in front of them!

&amp;#x200B;

Gentle readers, that is when I put my phone into my pocket and proceeded to walk home from the train station whilst being completely bamboozled over what had happened over those few days.

CAST OF CHARACTERS:

&amp;#x200B;

Returning, we have KingOfTheSouth. Maybe 6'2"" and easily 260 lbs, Claims to work out frequently, but you  wouldn't know it from looking at his gut. I can't take credit for the  nickname; he came up with it for himself (of *course* he's from Texas; however did you guess?). Frequent star in my submissions to [/r/TalesOfMike](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesOfMike).

&amp;#x200B;

New Characters: OldManager, NewManager, CoolDad, and EldestDaughter. Names are self-explanatory, only relevant detail is that CoolDad works in the same group as me.

I don't think I mentioned this before, but for reference the previous story took place in mid-2018.

&amp;#x200B;

Story #1: Potluck Panic

&amp;#x200B;

Over the summer, our department holds potlucks/barbecues-company provides the meat, grills, and charcoal, everything else is provided by the workers. There are two obvious if unspoken rules: Don't come if you didn't bring something, and make sure there is enough to go around (read: The company's not generous enough to pay for 3 burgers/person).

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth, however, was undeterred by these rules-he loaded up maybe 2 or 3 plates; I'd guess he took 4 burgers, a whole party size bag of chips, and maybe half a tub of ~~mayo with potato bits~~ potato salad. At least there was plenty of salad left when he was done serving himself?

OldManager shows up a bit late to the potluck because he'd been busy doing actual work, and.... no burgers or good sides left even though the thing wasn't over. He had the good manners to say it was no big deal, and we were all really apologetic that he'd gotten shafted like that (I didn't know this since I was new at the time but apparently it was really unusual to run out like that). Well, almost all of us-KingOfTheSouth didn't even notice, and just kept obliviously working on his 4th burger of the day while we tried to see if we could scrounge up some odds &amp; ends for OldManager.

&amp;#x200B;

A few hours later, we get the predictable email: ""We really shouldn't have to say this, but please be considerate of others when serving yourself, and don't attend unless you are bringing something to share"".

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth saw this email, and ~~waddled~~ sprinted down the hallway to sulk at the guy who'd sent out the email. I didn't hear the conversation, but apparently this was such an injustice that he was never going to attend the potlucks again because he didn't believe in sharing food that was rightfully his. When I heard this story 2nd hand from HandleWithCaution, he was trying (hard) and failing to keep from giggling while recounting it.

It later turned out that KingOfTheSouth now exclusively eats in the on-site cafeteria so that it's inarguably ""his"" food.... nevermind that they charge more for one sandwich + fries than it would have cost him to get a 2L bottle of coke for the potluck instead.

&amp;#x200B;

TL,DR: Fatty gets told to share if he's going to come to potlucks, stops going altogether as a result/in ""protest"". I don't think he thought this through very well.

STORY #2: Change in Management

&amp;#x200B;

One other gross (but relevant) detail: KingOfTheSouth's teeth are always yellow. Like, ""never brushes"" yellow. I've seen smokers and 3-cups-a-day coffee fiends with better teeth.

APPETIZER: Meet the New Boss

&amp;#x200B;

One morning in Fall 2018, I get an email from OldManager saying (in about as many words) ""Impromptu staff meeting tomorrow at 9AM"". This is unusual, but whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

The morning after, we have the meeting, and OldManager reveals what is going on: He's swapping places with another manager, effective in a couple of weeks, and NewManager will be reaching out to us shortly to help smooth the transition.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a little concerned since this was announced on really short notice and managing our group is usually viewed as a ""starter"" position for new managers or a booby prize/punishment for more senior folks who screwed up.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, a week or so later we meet NewManager. He introduces himself, tells us about his background, and asks for a brief explanation of current work and impending deadlines. As you might expect, asking a bunch of nerds about our specialty results in us giving him more information than is healthy or reasonable. KingOfTheSouth doesn't say a word, and NewManager doesn't ask, to the dismay of none. NewManager then gives us a brief update on general administrative stuff (e.g. signing up for healthcare); KingOfTheSouth is obviously ignoring him at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

NewManager: Also, I skimmed the engagement surveys and morale could definitely be higher. I'd like to go more in-depth on this once you've had time to think it over, but is there anything you can think of off the top of your heads for things I can do to help?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: SoundOfSilence.mp3

&amp;#x200B;

NewManager: Our meeting's probably over since there are people waiting at the door, but any final questions?

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: I know this is off the topic, but last year OldManager bought us food at the end of the year. Are you going to do that as well?

&amp;#x200B;

(Aside: He was referring to a holiday luncheon coordinated by the staff and funded by  the company-the first line manager isn't really involved at all, and KotS should have realized that since he'd been there for &gt; 1 year at this point)

&amp;#x200B;

To reiterate: Short-notice change in management? Doesn't matter. Incoming manager's background is different enough that (by his own admission) he is going to need a bit more lead time/explanation than OldManager whenever we ask him to sign off on something? Same. But don't you DARE get in the way of his $15 worth of beetus!

&amp;#x200B;

We were all facepalming inside, but KingOfTheSouth's lack of shame and common sense meant he didn't notice.

&amp;#x200B;

NewManager (Obviously thought he'd be getting a real question) Um.... let me get back to you on that.

&amp;#x200B;

ENTREE: Fuck Off, 2018

&amp;#x200B;

Late 2018 rolls around, and our group collectively agrees to go to a burger joint for an early dinner. Needless to say, KingOfTheSouth is extremely hyped, and keeps bragging about how much he's going to eat there.

&amp;#x200B;

The day arrives, and KotS is nowhere in the office. He doesn't even show up to the dinner at all. It later turns out that he'd finally gone to the dentist, and they'd found so many problems that the cleaning had basically put him out of commission for the day. Investigations are ongoing, but ~~common sense~~ the tinfoil-hat crowd suspects that his permanently yellow teeth should have been an obvious warning sign.

&amp;#x200B;

With KotS absent, the rest of us have a great time. CoolDad even brought his kids to the thing

CoolDad: EldestDaughter, sweetie, what sound does Darth Vader make?

&amp;#x200B;

(note: EldestDaughter is maybe 4 years old).

&amp;#x200B;

EldestDaughter: *Puts hand over mouth and does an uncannily good impression of Vader's breathing*.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, it really was a blast, and a great way to end the year (this was on the Thursday of our last working week of 2018).

&amp;#x200B;

TL,DR: Karma is a beautiful thing sometimes. Also, Star Wars nerds have the best kids.

fatpeoplestories,"This classmate is just an asshole in general if I’m being honest, not everything she does is related to her being overweight but it doesn’t help when she comments on other peoples eating habits.

She (F16) weighs at least 300lbs, has no sense of personal space, and thinks she’s not fat. 

I’m (F17) currently 170lbs as a result of childhood bad eating habits but am trying to change to get down to a healthy weight for my size.

There have been occasions where she’s walked up to me, no hello, no how are you, just “Maybe you should rethink what you’re eating.” I’ve given her subtle hints that I don’t want her near me since I can’t stand her terrible personality &amp; on top of that she’s got a really bad fish odour that nobody wants to mention to her (someone should though because she took my deodorant &amp; used it without asking - my roll on deodorant. Needless to say I didn’t want it back).

Back to her weight issues though, the lifts on campus accommodate 21 people, realistically about 12 average sized people when you take into account that everybody wants personal space. But does she follow this rule? No. I got in a lift to go to the ground floor, me being in there was a push but my friend was already in and he made space for me; my classmate decided to follow me into the lift so she wouldn’t get left behind, great idea! Yes of course we want an obese person getting in the already full lift! :) I don’t know how she thought she would fit but she tried, she got in &amp; pushed everyone back, she even said “Come on, I’m not that big.” when someone from the back yelled for her to get her fat ass out (mean, but funny).

One squashed &amp; smelly lift ride later, I was free. Except that she walked behind me on my way to the library and felt the need to walk literally right behind me - as in her belly fat was pressed against my back, I walked faster so she wouldn’t be touching me &amp; she yelled at me to slow down because “I may look athletic but I don’t always want to run down the halls you know.”

No clue why she’s so deep in denial but I hope for everyone’s sake that she either makes new friends or moves to a different campus. :/",Fat Shamed by Classmate at Least 100lbs Bigger Than Me
fatpeoplestories,"So I know it's been a while but I've been at a place on a shift where I have little human contact and my hamstronomy has been lacking for a long while. Well boys and girls, I now work security at a call center. Call centers are ham planetariums if you ever have seen one.

To quote that famous line from King Size Homer ""Must be all that sitting and nonstop snacking!"". Unfortunately these people don't wear mu-mus but they should! They really should.

There are about a 50% hamplanet to human ratio here. With that, very few stand out because I really just see them enter and leave the building. The place is located by several fast food joints and I see a parade of Whataburger, Jack in the Box, Popeye's, Wendy's, etc. in their pudgy paws as they amble towards their desks so they don't burn precious calories.

Well one stands out above all of them. Well two but this one is about a lady who looks like the Gilbert Grape mom on steroids. She has a stainless steel cane she uses to help support her mass as she waddles towards our turnstiles. I have never seen anyone scrape the inner wall of these things and we have some serious porkers here.

She always grunts when just waddling and just glares at me when I tell her to have a nice day. I guess her other job as Shamu's stunt double makes her unhappy or whatever. I don't let the bastards get me down.

Well yesterday she waddles out, and while I'm glad to have not been sucked into her gravitational pull again as she leaves the area, she starts waddling back in.

She gruffly mutters ""Forgot something in the ice box."" And leaves her rolling suit case thingy (all fatties seem to have it here, must be full of Little Debbies to keep them not so little) by my desk. On the top of the bag, snugged between the the handle and the bag is the halves of egg cartons. The big ones you get at the grocery store. 36 count eggs.

I generally ignore this whale but now I am fascinated by this weird set up. What in the world would she be doing with so many eggs? Baking a her-size snack? It just perplexes me why she would lug what is obviously trash. Was she more than a hoarder of calories but also a hoarder of trash?

While I ponder this deeply troubling series of questions she is waddling at MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE back to my desk and starts demanding when the cleaning crew empties the fridges on Fridays. It's a rhetorical question since the sign on EVERY fridge states it's 5:00PM. I tell her the time and she huffs that she was only late by ""a few minutes"". Now I don't know if fatties have time dilation but the current time was after 6PM. I shrug and give a dishonest ""So sorry to hear that."" which enrages her to ramble on about how food is expensive.

Now, normally I'd want to make a crack about how fatty can skip several hundred meals but I want to keep my job. I just shrug and basically she waddles off in a huff about how her food was ""stolen"".

Now I wonder how old this hambeast is because I have never heard anyone under the age of 80 refer to a fridge as an ice box.

Anyways, I'm back and I will definitely have stories of fatties. The other one I mentioned earlier is a woman who is so fat she uses a walker like a person 40 years older than her.",The IceBox Cometh
fatpeoplestories,"I know I promised some more amusing Cousin Carnie stories and apologize that I haven't posted in a while. I figure I have at least seven more stories, but not all of them are about her being fat and lazy, some of them are about her being really stupid. I figured maybe I should just jump ahead to the ones most related to this sub. Hope you find this one amusing.

  
If you haven't heard earlier Cousin Carnie stories, you may want to [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/9rh5f9/cousin_carnie_part_1/).

  
This is long, so there is a tl;dr summary at the bottom if you want to miss out on all the crazy twists and turns and get to the end of the story right away.

  
One year a few years back, my air conditioner crapped out and it happened to be the week of 4th of July which somehow played a part in a delay in getting it repaired. While waiting on parts, I had to live without A/C for over a week and it wasn't fun.  But I was raised without A/C so maybe I handle heat better than others, and I can generally be rather stoic so got through it with minimal complaining. Mostly we got through it drinking a lot of frozen water, using plenty of fans and ice packs and going to the movie theater on the weekend to freeze our butts off so we didn't mind the heat so much when I left because I needed to thaw out. Haha!

  
That was during the time that Carnie would sometimes still come over for movie nights, because I remember her calling about coming over and I said, ""Well, just so you know, my air conditioning isn't working – "" and she quickly said, ""Okay, maybe another time then!"" She was not having anything to do with a warm house. That's fine, I didn't blame her. But I couldn't help but notice that Carnie had zero sympathy for my situation. It's not that I expected a lot of ""Oh, poor yous!"" or invites to her house to cool off.  I'm only highlighting what we already know: Carnie only cares about Carnie and no one else.  


But that's fine.  


On the other side of town, she lived in a small two-bedroom apartment at the time. The kitchen and living room were about the same size, the kitchen had the usual appliances and cupboards and room enough for a kitchen table against the far wall, but instead that's where their dog crates were. The living room was big enough for one sofa, a TV stand with a TV on it and a bookshelf filled with DVDs. The bedrooms were also small. One of the bedrooms was just their junk/storage room and they just kept that room closed. They had a window air conditioning unit in the kitchen window, another in the living room window and one in their bedroom window. That seemed like it should be adequate for such a small apartment.

  
The summer following my own air conditioning woes, I got a call from her, upset because their bedroom A/C had stopped working. I gave her sympathy because that's what she wanted but also, I did feel bad for her.  It's never fun trying to sleep without air conditioning in the hot months.  


Yet for someone who had zero sympathy for my situation, she sure wanted mounds of sympathy when it happened to her. Of course, she felt like she and her husband had enough ""health conditions"" that it was a much more dire situation than mine had been. I suppose there is something about being obese that can make you less able to tolerate hot weather, or at least they like to think so. One time their power was out all afternoon in the summertime and to hear her tell it, you might think it was some kind of human rights violation against people with health problems for the power company to *allow* the power to be out. (Neither one was on any kind of life-saving machines or anything like that.)

  
But at least, unlike when my central AC unit went out, and unlike the time the power was out, they still had other rooms in their house with A/C. But that wasn't good enough for her.

  
This might be a personal failing, but I tend to be a solutions-oriented person, so when someone calls to tell me their woes, I immediately want to brainstorm solutions to help them.  


Stop for a moment and think about if you were in this situation. It's hot, your bedroom window A/C stopped working, and it's the middle of summer in a warm climate. You don't have a lot of money. What kind of solutions would you consider? What would you do?

  
I don't care what your answer is, but whatever answer you just came up with, I guarantee you Carnie would not have chosen that solution. If the solution makes any kind of sense, it's *not* a Cousin Carnie Solution.

  
**Me:** Is the landlord going to come take a look?  
*Carnie: No, because we own the A/C. He's not going to come look at it!*  
**Me:** Oh. And Harry doesn't know how to work on them? Maybe youtube has some videos of A/C unit repairs?  
(Harry worked at an auto shop working on cars, so maybe he was good at tinkering/fixing things? It could be worth a try at least?)  
*Carnie (irritated): No! They make these units to just be disposable and replace them! You can't* fix *them!*

  
I'm a little skeptical of *that*, but I don't know much about the topic or how old the unit was so I wasn't going to argue. However, this brought up a new thought. This is Carnie and Harry, so it's a safe bet that they'd done exactly ZERO preventive maintenance on their A/C units, or weather-proofed them during the winter months, which could be a clue to why it had stopped working! Still, by this time, I mostly don't care enough to lecture her anymore, and anyway, it's too late to go there.

  
**Me:** That's too bad. Maybe you can sleep in the living room a few days?  
*Carnie (still irritated): There isn't enough room for us both to sleep in the living room!! We only have the one sofa!*  
**Me:** Oh yeah. Well, could you put the living room unit into the bedroom, so you can at least be cool while you sleep?  
*Carnie: No!! The living room A/C isn't very powerful and we'd still be hot!! I don't know what we're going to do!!*

  
I don't know either. Even if there was nothing wrong with the living room A/C, let's face it: neither one of them would be interested in doing the manual labor of moving it to another window, anyway. Which made me wonder – when they found a new bedroom unit, who would install it? (snicker)

  
Well, never mind. I got the impression that she was fishing for an invitation to come hang out at my house because my A/C was working, but by this time I didn't want her in my house anymore and anyway, I didn't have time to entertain her. She can go to the library if she needs to cool off. I told her I felt really bad for them, and I'd do some looking around to find out who had the cheapest window A/C units in the area and if I heard of a sale or saw one used on a resale page or at a thrift store, I'd let her know. I got off the phone.

  
When I got back to her a couple of days later, I'd found a sale flyer with some units on sale to tell her about. She didn't care anymore - they'd already replaced it. I said, great, I was happy for them. I thought alls well that ends well.  


But of course that's not the end of this story! It's a *Carnie* story, they never resolve so easily! There is *always* several extra layers of batshit-crazy yet to come. Buckle up.

  
About a month later she calls me up, on a Friday afternoon, upset again. The A/C unit they just got for the bedroom wasn't working and whatever would they doooo?

  
I said, wtf? how could a brand new unit just die about a month after you get it? It MUST still be under some kind of warranty, right? They were going to take it back, right? She said her husband had called them and they would come out and replace it on Monday, but tragedy of tragedies, they couldn't come out before then.

  
A place that comes out and installs the unit for you?  Hey, I guess that's convenient for these two! Apparently she didn’t get it from Walmart!

  
She kept whining obnoxiously, certain they would literally die having to wait for A/C until Monday. So, still brainstorming, I asked if Harry could take out the unit and take it back to the store himself to trade it out? Yeah, it would mean he'd have to do all the work (which he's allergic to), and I know he doesn't really *want* to, but it can't be that difficult, can it? If they really couldn't live without it for three nights, wouldn't it be worth it? Her answer was that no, it doesn't work that way or whatever, so, still trying to make some actual sense out of this whole, crazy story, I thought it had something to do with voiding a warranty and I left it at that.

  
So now I focused on showing empathy and reminding her of my misery without A/C for a week the year before. She got impatient, not wanting to hear me complain about *my* problems because she only cared to talk about her own crisis. Still, I tried to give her tips on how to survive the weekend without AC but she wouldn't listen -- again, because of their ""*conditions""* nothing I could suggest would pertain to them. It was different for them.

  
(For the record, it was not going to be in the 100s that weekend or anything like that. We don't have a super amount of humidity here either.)  


Look, I am not saying they didn't have some health conditions. They both probably likely did due to their weight and poor diet if from nothing else. But they were also huge babies and hypochondriacs so it's difficult to know where their actual health issues end and the lies and exaggerations began. I'll probably tell you more about that in a future chapter. But for now, not being a medical professional and not having access to their medical files, I cannot be certain what, if any, conditions they had that would have meant sudden death without A/C for the weekend. But I have some doubts.

  
My daughter's bedroom was empty as she was mostly living elsewhere by then, but there is no way in hell I'd have offered it to Carnie and Harry. She didn't like them and would have come home and murdered me in my sleep if she'd known they'd been in her room. See Also: [Part 5 in this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/a2jd2b/cousin_carnie_part_4_dont_invite_carnie/). So no, don't worry, I wasn't going to violate House Rule #1 and invite Carnie to stay the weekend!

  
Actually though, Carnie didn't even ask or fish for an invitation. She had her own plan: she had worked out a deal with her boss at the crappy hotel she worked at (where she got only one shift a week). They would stay there for $25 a night or $75 for the weekend.  


I couldn’t resist asking, because they were chronically broke:  
**Me:** Uh, can you afford that?  
*Carnie: I mean, NO, I don't have $75, but they said they'll just take it out of my check.*  
**Me:** Oh. Can you afford that?  
*Carnie: What choice do I have??? We* can't *sleep without air conditioning! What can we dooooo?*  
**Me:** I know it's miserable, but --  
*Carnie: But we have medical conditions!! Harry has a bad heart you know!*  
**Me** (washing my hands of it)**:** Oh, okay then.

  
I don't know what to say here, other than this is Classic Carnie. She doesn't give a damn about long term consequences until they hit, yet reserves the right to act persecuted whenever having to deal with said consequences. Every decision she (or Harry) would make, they would choose whatever was going to be easiest out or most instantly gratifying, regardless of what is in their best interests long-term. These two were never going to be capable of making mature, reasonable decisions! It's like they never matured passed age 12.  


I left it at that, and thought that was the end of the story. Oh no no no! It continues to get better.

  
Mid-week the next week, she called to give me the update. She still wasn't happy.

  
*Her: When they brought the replacement AC, it was a portable, not a window A/C. it's not very good.*  
**Me:** Wait—what the fuck is going on here? What company replaces your defective, brand new window unit with a totally different kind of A/C unit? What part of the story did you skip over here??  
*Her: We got it from R-A-C.*  
**Me:** What the hell is that?  
*Her: Rent-A-Center.*  
**Me:** Holy shit… you're buying your window A/C company from a *rent-to-own* place?  
*Her: Yeah? So?*  
**Me:** Why would you do that?? You will pay three times as much as a brand new unit for something that is probably already used when you get it. And now you tell me that if the used one they sell you doesn't work they can replace it with whatever they have in stock even if it's not the same thing? And you're okay with that?? What a shady company!  
*Her: Well, we didn't have the money for a new unit from Walmart! We had to have something! We can't sleep without air conditioning!!!*  


To this day I still don't know the full story here. I sort of suspect that the first window A/C they 'bought' from RAC got repossessed, maybe? And that possibly the ""wait until Monday"" deal had something to do with waiting until they had the money to go pay it up or start a new contract and then had to take whatever else they had in stock that day? That's my best guess, anyway, maybe you have a better guess. I've never dealt with these companies so I have no idea.

  
But then, even though they were struggling to pay their RAC bill, they blew $75 on a motel for the weekend? Oh sure, this all sounds totally legit. Who does this??

  
I don't mean to mock them for being so broke, and I understand sometimes poor people have limited options. It's just these choices just seem so bizarre. Limited options I understand. Making the stupidest possible decisions every time is where they lose me.

  
But that's not even the craziest part. Here is the twist ending that I could not believe.

  
Months go by… maybe even a year. She calls me one day to gossip/complain about some of her  neighbors moving out of the apartment building. (It was a small building with only about six or eight units.) She'd apparently been talking to Mrs. Slumlord about it. While she's rambling on, I'm not sure why she's telling me all this because I don't care, and I'm only half listening when I hear something of interest.  


*Carnie: He left because he was going to be evicted. But can you believe this? He even stole the air conditioners! What a dickwad! But I'm glad he's gone. I didn't like him. He had too many weird friends over. I hope--*  
**Me:**  Wait, back up a second. Who did he steal air conditioners from?  
*Carnie: From the apartment! They belonged to the landlord. This jackass took them when he moved out! What a terrible way to treat the landlord!! He left owing rent AND stole from them, too. These people are all so trashy! I hate thieves! So anyway--*  
**Me:** No, wait, let's revisit this thing about the window A/C units from the landlord. How does this neighbor rate that the landlord provides him with A/C but **you** had to buy your own last summer and go through all that drama? Did this neighbor pay more rent every month for the A/C units or something?  
*Carnie (confused): What? What are you talking about?*  
**Me:** How did HIS apartment come with A/C units but yours didn't?  
*Carnie: Oh. Well, ours did come with A/C units too. The ones we have in the living room and kitchen belong to the landlord, but in the bedroom we needed a more powerful unit, so when we moved in, we took out the one from the bedroom out of the window and just put it in the junk room, and brought our own from the last place we lived for the bedroom. That's why the landlord wouldn't fix the unit.*  
**Me:** So wait a minute! You're telling me that during that whole summer drama of A/C units dying and having to be replaced and you had to go stay in a hotel, that **whole time** you had a working window A/C unit just sitting on the floor of your spare bedroom and you didn't think to use it, even temporarily?  
*Carnie: Well, it isn't very powerful!*  
**Me** (in Mom Mode again)**:** Is it better than nothing, Carnie?? Is it better than spending $75 you didn't have to stay in a hotel??  
*Carnie: It wasn’t even worth it to put it in the window just to have to take it out a couple of days later!!! Duh!*  
**Me:** Carnie, you astound me.  


She went through these shady, rent-to-own places and stayed in a hotel because she felt the window unit wasn't ""powerful"" enough to cool off a small bedroom barely big enough to fit their queen sized bed and two nightstands?? In what world does this make sense? I know that obese people often are hotter all the time than the rest of us, but does it make you stupid, too? The idea that they had to have some ""heavy-duty"" A/C unit to keep a small bedroom cool seems to be pure insanity.

  
Every time – every damn time I got sucked into some drama with Carnie, ridiculous crap would come out of her mouth and by the time we got to the end of the story I'd be ripping my hair out trying to figure out what the hell was wrong with her.

  
Still, I admit, there may still be more to this story that I don't fully understand. I don't know how good or bad those window units from the landlord were. I don't know much about window A/C units. I don't know what the whole deal with the RAC contract was about. Maybe I'm just really uncharitable.

  
I told her, ""You know what? Don’t ever complain to me about your air conditioner woes again, okay? Not when you have a spare unit in your spare room that you just don't want to use."" I was now entering the ""I don't give a shit phase"" of the relationship.

  
**tl;dr:** Hammy Cousin Carnie had problems with her air conditioning, thought they would literally die without air conditioning due to their ""conditions"", whined to me endlessly, found the absolute most expensive temporary solutions (despite being totally broke), only for me to find out, months later, that she had a spare window A/C unit all along, but felt it ""wasn't powerful enough"" and, I suspect, they were just too lazy to install it.

fatpeoplestories,"EDIT: English is not my first language. So? This is exactly why I hate people. So r/engrish you interested now? Can you take these people away and make sure they never fly any airlines? 

So, ok, I was a flight attendant (FA) for 6 years before I give up my wings for good last December. 

When the post about that fat ham and his shameful way of asking FAs to wipe him off while muttering ""deeper deeper"" hit front page, I wasn't surprised.

I worked for two different carriers during my FA days; one for a ""full service"" airline and another for a low cost carrier. That incident happened on a full service carrier (EVA Air if I'm not mistaken).

A lot of people were appalled by his behaviour and y'all should be because no human being, regardless of what industry they work in/for, should be treated that way. That's a legit sexual harassment there. What baffles me is that the airline does not take the issue seriously until it was blown out of proportion by another passenger who was disgusted by the whole thing.

Thing about human being is that, the aircraft mystifies them. As soon as they boarded, all hell breaks loose. Some people definitely checked in their common sense into the cargo leaving us FAs with people who just dont get why some people are born into this world.

My point is, I have seen people like that flying with me before. Just disgusting ball of fat and yucky and not much else. Unfortunate for them, this happen on my second carrier, a low cost airline, so not much fucks are given towards this guy. He shouted and yelled and threatened to sue the fuck out of us because we were not helpful, but end of the day, you pay peanuts for ticket and expect us to lick your butthole? You can do it yourself you shameful humanbeing.

On a full service carrier, it might be different. I have been shamed before because an able bodied person think of me as a fucking slave and when I refused to stow his luggages away, he screamed and muttered some inappropriate words calling me whore and what not. 

Full service carriers often put their crews in a hard position; we want to make sure you're safe and comfortable but we are NOT your slaves. 

When I made the switch to a low cost carrier, the passengers basically know that they pay peanuts for tickets so they expect lesser. They know what they're getting. They made less fuss and I was grateful for that.

I have seen people who simply raid my carts without asking for permission with the excuse that they pay this much for the ticket, so they're entitled to whatever. One guy actually put his pudgy hand on my tights while I was seated in the galley eating and offered for me to go back to his hotel room.

He smelled like he has not showered in a year. Wtf. 

He had also downed a 1.5 liter of coke, so nah, mate, I am not flattered. I'm rather disgusted by the way you behaving right now. Get your hand off me. 

He fucking wrote a complaint to my company saying I was rude. What a laugh. Luckily my other colleagues testified on behalf of me and said he came full on hard on me and he looks like the next ticking bomb about to happen. 

So the next time any of you see that kind of incident happen again, bear in mind; the ones that didn't make it to the front page posts, are one too many.

fatpeoplestories,"Need to vent. First time poster, long time lurker.

A serious pet hate of mine is people feeling it is appropriate to comment on other people’s food choices. This happens to me quite a lot, but this most recent incident sent me over the edge... funnily enough, this time it wasn’t a comment about my food.

I get lunch with a few of my coworkers everyday. Two girls are not huge, but maybe 40-50 lbs overweight. They share bad diet ideas.

Another guy in our lunch group is on the larger side- not fat, but very broad and bulky. He is super fit, cycles, gym every day, training for his second iron-man type adventure race. He therefore eats a lot of food. He’s lovely and a bit quiet.

Sitting eating at lunch, this guy takes out a HUGE homemade salad- at least 6 portions of different veg, grilled chicken and some kind of creamy dressing...

One of the girls, eating a toasted fried chicken sandwich with melted cheese, points at his lunch with a greasy finger: ‘Oh my god, why bother eating a salad if you’re gonna put a load of mayo on it??? There’ll be as many calories in that as in my lunch! What a waste!’

Guy goes slightly red and mumbles that hes working out later so isn’t it ok to have a bit of nice dressing... 

I was pushed over the edge when everyone else started agreeing with her. ‘Creamy sauces are so unhealthy’, ‘McDonalds salads have MORE calories’ ‘Do you know how many calories are in avocados??’ etc etc... Bear in mind almost everyone around the table is eating some form of fast food too, nothing resembling healthy.

Me to everyone: ‘Are you guys joking or are you stupid enough to be arguing that 1000 calories of deep fried crap is as good for you as 1000 calories of fruit and veg?’

I get responses of ‘Studies have been done, you lose weight on a calorie deficit, it doesn’t matter what you eat, so may as well eat what you like, a guy lost weight 50 pounds eating nothing but Doritos’ etc..

Healthy guy quietly finishes his salad and leaves looking deflated. I stay sitting, voice nearly reaching shouting level as I try to argue about protein/fat/carbs/nutrients/vitamins/fiber

I didn’t win the argument. Apparently a bit of dressing on a salad makes it exactly like a Big Mac, so screw it just eat Maccas.

I feel like I’m taking crazy pills.

Edit: just to clarify as many people have rightly pointed out, yes it's absolutely true that calorie deficit leads to weight loss. I was not arguing that point with them. I was arguing that how you spend your daily calories does have a big difference on your body- your energy, your sleep patterns, etc. Especially if you're someone exercising frequently. People are skinny with high cholesterol and other problems. I was arguing about overall health as part of weight loss. 

Also important point, these girls are NOT actually eating at a calorie deficit. They are talking about it, while eating 2000-3000 calories every day at lunch.",Fatties food shame guy eating salad cuz calories
fatpeoplestories,"I work with a girl who has lost a whole heap of weight... talking around 60kgs.  Shes relatively slim now and understandably very careful about what she eats because she knows she suffers with food addiction.  Lets call her Stacy.

Now at our workplace we have a bigger woman, not morbidly obese, but getting close.  Shes worked there forever and is a massive bully, she's not spoken to me for 4 months now because of a super petty issue.  Our manager also seems to be afraid of her so she very rarely gets pulled up on her behaviour and knows she can throw her weight around.  She is also a supervisor, which also makes her more senior than all other characters in this story.  Let's call her Karen.

Stacy pulled me aside one day as I had recently lost about 15kgs, she asked me if Karen had attacked me about being anorexic.  ""Well no, but she still hasn't acknowledged my exsitance from last time I upset her""... Stacy told me that Karen had been giving her a hard time about how much weight she had lost and started saying she was anorexic.  I told stacy she needs to go to our manager, she didn't want to face the same fate as me and be ignored by Karen. 

A few weeks later the office received a box of chocolate from a client, Karen was digging in, I grabbed one of my favourites out of the box and had a seat in the main part of the office.  Stacy wandered into the main part of the office
Karen ""have a chocolate Stacey!""
Stacy ""no thanks I'm still really careful about what I eat""
K ""it's just one chocolate! Whats the worse that could happen?""
S ""I just don't want a chocolate Karen""
K ""honestly you never eat anything, you'll probably get admitted to an ED clinic soon!""
Me ""so Declan, how was your weekend buddy?"" (desperately attempting to move the conversation onto something else)
K ""oh yeah, Declan!  Help me hold her down whilst I make her eat this chocolate, ahahaha""
Me ""Hey Stace, can you help me with something over in my area""...

Stacy followed me to my area and broke down into tears, I encouraged her to go to our manager about it.  A few days later I got a call from my manager asking me what went down, which I told him the story.  When I next saw my manager I asked him what happened, nothing, Stacy lost her nerve and asked him not to say anything to Karen.  He then turned around and said ""Karen probably didn't mean anything hurtful, she would have been saying it in a caring way, you know she's got such a strong maternal instinct.""  Fucking bullshit, this woman is a massive bully and has had run ins with at least 4 other people in our work place.

EDIT: For those saying I should go to HR, I asked my friend if she wanted me to go to HR, she asked me not to.  Unfortunately it is her battle to fight not my own, if Karen ever tries this with me I will be going straight to HR.",You're anorexic! Hamplanet attempts to force feed my friend chocolate.
fatpeoplestories,"I work as a lifeguard over the summer and let me tell you, the manager is HUGE. She looks like a ball. Probably about 5'2 and easily 200-250 lbs. And I don't feel bad about saying that because she's not a nice person either. This is just a collection of things she's said/done that have really just made me stop and think.

It was raining one day and no one was at the pool so we were all in the lifeguard office. There's an ice cream vending machine in there. She went over to it and asked, ""is it bad that I want 2?"" I said ""I don't know"" in a pretty indifferent tone even though yeah, that's too much ice cream. She got 2 ice creams.

She would eat lunch at the front desk so sometimes I would go up and talk to her when there was no one else to talk to. Alot of times she would have a nice salad, and then add 2 whole hamburgers to it! That's like 500 extra calories!

She was so lazy. She would sit at the desk all day and make the guards test the chemical levels every hour even though it was her job. And when the chemical levels were wrong, she wouldn't do anything so the pH level was always kind of wack.

One time she was talking about her swimsuit size. She said it was a 36, which I don't believe at all. I wear a 32 and I'm 5'9 and 120 lbs. There's no way she's only 2 sizes bigger than me despite being 100 lbs bigger. Later that day she asked me to get her jacket from her car. I checked the size because I was curious. 2X. Yeah there's no way she's a 36. Well actually, it's possible that she squeezes into a 36 but it definitely doesn't fit. You can see how tightly stretched the swimsuit material is over her stomach.

Sometimes she would ask me to put sunscreen on her back and that always grossed me out. So many rolls...

In general she was just a really mean, lazy person and all the guards would talk about her behind her back. We talked to the company about her but I don't think they ever did anything.",Hamanager
fatpeoplestories,"My friend Reese got 2 tickets to comedian Sarah Milliken's (not sure I spelled that correctly) live show. I'm not a fan but she is and needed someone to go with her, ofc I accepted, flattered she chose me to share her gift with. 





On to the show. We grab a couple of drinks from the venues bar before we head to our seats and everyone else is mostly seated. 



This is when it gets awkward, we locate our row and start walking down apologising very britishly for having to slide past people's legs and belongings, thanking them along the way, to get to our middle row seats. 





I notice my tickets seat number and its next to this behemoth of a woman, the chairs are regular chairs expected for a cinema/theatre with armrests either side. He left buttcheek/hip is wedged under the armrest, taking up roughly 50% of my seat.






As I go to sit down she shift her weight to her right which takes the space encroachment down to about 30%. I sit, she leans her weight back and essentially slides me towards Reese to my left until I am literally pinned against the armrest on Reese's side. The show hasn't even started yet and I am pissed the fuck off, the comedians desired demographic I'm sure.







I'm sipping my drink waiting for the show to start, HAM shifts her weight which causes a knock on ripple effect through her fat, to my arm, which had enough force to cause me to spill some of my drink.





 I ignore it and turn to face Reese with a ""did you honestly just fucking see that?"" look on my face, she bursts out laughing and she shuffles as far to the left as she can in her seat and I am sitting with the armrest embedded in my side with my head touching Reese's shoulder. 





HAM takes advantage of the new space and let's more of her front/side butt seep over. I am furious and really really fucking uncomfortable, Reese by halfway through the first half of the show is as well. 




The intense heat radiating from this woman was indescribable, the soft mushy surface pressed against my whole right side by this point was making me want to gag. I actually did gag when the realisation hit me that if the heat from the room and her enormous body was making me sweat, the soft mush touching me was probably sweaty as well and I almost threw my cookies there and then.



Intermission finally came and I ran outside to get some fresh air and calm down, explained fully how upset I was to Reese and that I was going to say something to the HAM. She begged me not to and since I didn't buy the tickets and she didn't have to invite me, I stayed quiet. 





Reese did however switch seats with me since she is tiny and like a UK size 6. Even with Reese' tiny frame she was still pushed right up against me as HAM apparently reached her full expansion. 




The rest of the show was me and her uncomfortably pressed together again and her hair tickling my shoulder the entire time while HAM bellowed laughing at every mediocre joke told, the vibrations causing tremors throughout the entire row every time. 




When she actually guffawed laughing and slapped her knee enthusiastically it sounded like someone slapping runny custard. 




We were so traumatised by the absurdity of it all that we couldn't even talk about it on the way home. I'm still mad.

fatpeoplestories,"Just saw it tonight. A man on a disabled cart in the 400lbs range asked the lady behind the deli counter for some mashed potatoes. She tried to explain to him that she is cleaning up and that the hot food is no longer available as it was 9pm.

He starts yelling ""why not?!?! It's right there, just serve me some!!!"" and this poor lady has to keep saying that she can't give him any, the heat lamps haven't been on it for a while now. After asking a few more times the guy huffs and rolls away.

I'm just thinking to myself who the fuck wants cold food that's been sitting out all day? Also he could have got the prepackaged deli stuff but apparently that wasn't good enough for him. Part of me thinks he thought he could get a discount on the food by taking what they were going to toss out.

fatpeoplestories,"This happened around 8h ago(2:30pm I am from Germany).

I live in a street thats very narrow, the sidewalk is almost non existent. Even as a slim 6.4 guy I have to go sideways and squeeze between the parking cars.

So I was driving down the street, when I hit an obstruction a Ham(women 350-400lbs) walking down in the middle of the road. Ok I thought to myself there is no chance in hell she could fit on  the sidewalk so I just smiled and nodded at her, indicating to take her time I dont mind.

Then she flipped:
She stared screaming:
Goddamn PIIIGG!!!
You dont deserve to LIVEE!!

Then she attacked my car:
She broke of my side mirror, cracked my windshield!!! and ""stomped"" enough to scratch the whole front. Estimated damage around 6k€. From her clothing I probably wont see much of it.
I obviously called the cops, she was well known(I see her 2-3 times a week) and from what I  have been told she tried to attack even them.

fatpeoplestories,"I'm a server. I worked for four years at a sports bar and restaurant in a college town. I loved that job. We had food specials throughout the week, including wing night: 50¢ wings offered in multiples of 6. Wing night always brought in a crowd, and customers typically tipped higher than 20% in spite of the lower checks. 

One particular wing night, in walks a table of four. They wanted a booth - no problem - but as they squeezed into the seats, I was knocked into next year with this horrid stench of body odor, sweat, and unwashed vagina. Great.

Each person was no taller than 5'8"" and weighed no less than 280 pounds. When I say they squeezed into the booth, I mean there were rolls on the table, and not the bread kind. The sight combined with the smell made for an unpleasant serving situation, but I strive to treat all my customers with respect and compassion. 

I took their drink orders and they all wanted to order their wings right away. The mother of the group ordered two dozen wings for herself alone. I confirmed with her that because of the wing special, we couldn't offer to-go boxes, to which she replied, ""don't worry hun, they'll get eaten!"" Each remaining member also ordered between 18 to 30 wings apiece. At this point in my time there, that was the most I had ever witnessed a customer ordering for him/herself

When I delivered their drinks - two mountain dews, a Pepsi, and a corona - the mother asked for a plate of lemons for her daughter. ""I'm having all sorts of cravings!"" laughed the daughter. I just kind of looked at her, confused, when mother says ""she's pregnant, can't you tell?""

I am sure the look on my face was a pure expression of ""WTF"" but I managed to utter a congratulations and scurry back to the wait station to hide my incredulity. The first thought that popped into my head after the mother said that was, ""well, is the whole table pregnant?"" I returned with the lemons and asked about this girl's pregnancy, due date, etc., trying to hide the fact that I just thought the whole table was very large and gluttonous. 

That table ate all of their wings, drank multiple 20 oz glasses of soda, practically drank their ranch dressings (actually, no judgment there, that ranch is legit), wracked up a combined bill of about $80, and left me a combined $6 in tips. For the amount of work I put into making sure they had full drinks, extra wetnaps, all their food, and their checks cashed out in a timely manner, as well as managing to not barf every time I smelled their stank, the compensation was very subpar. 

The pregnant woman and her boyfriend came in a couple more times after that, each time wracking up bills of $50+ and tipping nothing until one of my managers basically told them to not come back if they weren't going to tip appropriately. I'm not sure if they ever came back, but that woman was, indeed, pregnant because I saw them come in with their newborn once and proceed to eat their weekly ration of deep fried chicken wings. 

Honestly it was just a sad situation. I always try not to judge because for all I know, wing night was their ""cheat meal"" but  with their combined odor and cheapness, they were less than desirable to have as customers.

TL;DR: Large hamplanet customers were less than desirable due to poor tipping and horrendous stench.",I served a table of hamplanets

Some things about me –  I suffered from anorexia most of my teen and young adult years. I was hospitalized twice, the second time when I was 20 and the doctors bluntly told me that I wouldn't live to have a 25th birthday if I'd go on like this. This was a wake up call for me to get my shit together and get healthy. It was the most difficult thing I ever did, but I succeeded (after many failed attempts). I'm mostly fine now (I'm 25) but I still have very bad days and I'm still nervous when people comment my food or my looks. I'm in the lower normal weight range (BMI is 19.5), I lift weights 3-4 times a week and do yoga. I mostly eat whatever I like, as long as it's in my daily calorie range of 1800 kcal. Sorry for the long intro, it's somewhat relevant for the story, I promise!     
I started a new job when I was 23, a boring office job but it paid fine. Most of my coworkers were women in their 40s, most slightly or more than slightly overweight. One day we had to move some boxes full of folders from one room into another and they all broke into sweat and complained that they had to do sth different than sitting for 1,5 hours. I ended up doing most of the work alone. One women in particular, let's call her Betsy, had a special dislike for me. No idea why, I feel like I'm a quiet and friendly person but she always commented on my body or my lunch, always scoffed when I mentioned the gym (I don't talk too much about it but sometimes people ask). Betsy is a small, chubby woman, not really overly fat but 30-40lbs overweight. She was always on some fad diet, eating nothing but cabbage soup for lunch, quitting carbs, having butter in her coffee, drinking a shot on apple vinegar before lunch (which consisted of a large Subway sub and  a small bag of chips). It was something different every two weeks. I walked into the lunch room once and caught her secretly munching a 100g chocolate bar. I also saw lots of candy wrappers in her trash can. Still, she complained that it was impossible for her to lose weight: it just had to be her genetics! She was eating practically nothing! How can people like QuietVisit eat all day long and be so skinny! This isn't fair! When I politely suggested she could join some gym classes, she very matter-of-factly told me that gyms doesn't work for weight loss. You only gain weight because of the muscles and she doesn't want manly muscles, they would only hide under her 'curves' and make her appear even fatter. Okay then.    
Some other comments she made towards me were ""Oh, you're just so skinny because you're young! When you're older you get fat as well, just wait and see!"", ""Well, I have better things to do than to waste all my time in the gym, sorry"", when she found out I didn't have a boyfriend back then: ""No wonder, men like curvy women"", ""Did you know that skinny people die earlier than chubby people??"", when I brought my lunch from home - spaghetti with veggie bolognese: ""Are you seriously going to eat all this??? Wow, I can't wait until this gets back to you and you get really fat!"". I was really shy back then so I mostly said nothing – somehow I knew that she was secretly jealous and had her own insecurity issues. But some of those comments really stung to be honest.

fatpeoplestories,"Last night I treated my sister to a cheese-less pizza with pepperoni and bacon, her favorite. I wasn't working but picked it up from a different Domino's after a night of running errands and she was watching a dog for some family friends.  She, not being a lardass, saves some for later and goes to bed tired.  But when our mom came home she went into my sister's room to see her. And instead of just talking to her, she did what she has always done: she begins eating the slices my sister was saving, but she wasn't even really eating the pizza. She just ate all the toppings off because ''the bread makes you fat''(WAY too late for that mom). Plus, she still eats things like fried fish and chicken, so all her talk of not eating sugar and drinking diet soda doesn't mean shit, and she's diabetic on top of that.


When my sister sees, she's justifiably upset and begins crying since our mom has always done shit like this, and justifies it with how much she's fed us over the years, despite the fact that was a pizza i bought with my money for her to make up for something. I then had to listen to them get into it for the rest of the night till I went to bed.

He's a good guy, really fun to be around, and weighs at 140kg (310ish lbs) while merely being 170ish cm tall (5ft6 ish). He's always complaining that he's fat, and how heavy he is and how he gained all the weight he had lost.

I mean, I get it. I've been there. Five years ago I was an athlete, literally. I had abs, 190cm and 100kg with 10ish% body fat and just let myself get to 40% body fat with 130kg. The difference is when someone extended a helping hand towards me, I took it. I made a change in my life. I didn't complain that someone extended the hand to me and I actually had to get up myself, the hand just didn't pull me alone. It just helped, but the effort to actually get up on my feet was mine. I'm now at 110kg at 18% body fat, I still have ground to cover, but I'm trying.

So for this guy, who has been a good friend for the past few years I wanted to be the helping hand. I try to get him to come to the gym with me, whenever he eats junk I scold him, and when we're together I try to eat as healthy as possible to help him, even if I had planned a cheat meal or don't want to be too strict.

Yesterday I heard him complaining about it. That he only keeps doing these stuff with me because I REALLY wanted him to come with me. He's doing these stuff because HE is a good friend.

He also is always telling how shallow women are for not wanting to be with him just because he's fat. Well, guess what dickwad, you also don't want to fuck women as fat as you.

fatpeoplestories,"After reading here for years and years- I finally have a story to contribute! I'm the mosh pit mommy, 5'2 125, eat well and exercise.


Background: I live in a small redneck town in a rural area in the south. I have 4 kids (4, 4, 9, 10) and we ride bikes to school. The older 4yo rides a ""big boy bike"" (it actually looks a little funny, because he's so small for his age, but he rides very well) and the younger 4yo is in a bike trailer pulled by yours truly. We go down back roads the whole .8 miles to and from school, and my 3 riders are great about stop signs, staying on the right, letting big trucks pass, etc. 


Now onto the beetus. As I mentioned, we ride the same route to the same place twice a day every day, and then I go back a couple miles to drop off the youngest at daycare. There haven't been many issues, until Yeehawg took umbrage.


Yeehawg is, well, bring to mind every negative stereotype of a white trash woman. Unkempt curls, brown cigarettes, shitty tattoos, too-tight raggedy clothes, filthy falling-apart pickup truck with a rebel flag, too much makeup, lots of acne, kids not buckled up, and of course fat. Very very fat. I have no height/weight estimate as I've never seen her stand up, but she has to lean forward to reach the steering wheel. Since the seat is pushed all the way back to accommodate her currrrrrves. IDK how many kids, it's either 4 or 5 and they're all super fat also. One of the kids has a roll on his throat that flaps down past his collarbones (looks like a first grader).


Yeehawg likes to speed up when she sees us in the road. Or pull up behind us at a stop sign and lay on the horn. ""Git outta da roooooooooooooooad!"" ""Ahm'a me LAAAAAAAYYYYYYTE cuzza y'all!"" Yeah, she's going to the same place as me. Somehow were always on time. Always had time to stop for fast food otw to school bc that's what she and kids are always eating when they pass us. On their way to free breakfast at school, which I'm sure her kids also eat.


On Monday, we took the long way to school (for the ""downhill whee"" that everyone enjoys) so she saw us at the four way stop. Waved us past with her sandwich hand. I let the 3 kids turn first, and then I go behind. Yeehawg waits until I'm halfway turned (remember, hauling a trailer with a child in it so I make wide turns) before stomping the gas and coming very close to hitting us. I swerve, almost over turning the damn trailer, and give her the finger. ""Fuck yew too, skinny bitch!"" she says. This is all like, right in front of the damn elementary school.


Tuesday we leave early to avoid her, but the 9yo had to stop and tie his shoe so she ends up behind us at the same 4 way stop. This time as soon as my 4yo starts to ride, she pulls out like squealing tires, stops in the middle of the intersection, rolls down her window, and yells at him. Yells at a preschooler. ""You're too lil to be on dat bike, can yew een ride it? You needa tell yo mama to drive yew!"" 4yo keeps riding like a boss. Yeehawg idles at the crossing guard, blocking their way to school.


On Wednesday, she gives my 10yo a breakfast sandwich since she's ""the only one of y'all who stays out of my way"". My 10yo, who has food allergies, said no and this bitch THREW A SAUSAGE MCMUFFIN AT MY DAUGHTER. I ride up next to her car and tell her the next time she talks to any of my kids I'm gonna call the cops. 


Thursday, she blew her horn at the 4yo and he fell off his bike. She then yelled triumphantly ""I TOLD YEW HES TOO DAMN LIL FOR DAT BIG BIKE"". I yelled back, he'll get bigger but you'll always be TOO DAMN BIG for any bike, hell you're TOO DAMN BIG for a Harley. This is the first time she actually started to get out of the car ""that skinny howwwwwer called me fat! Bitch I'll show yew who's fat!"" Even the 4yo rides faster than Yeehawg can exit a pickup truck with hands full of beetus, so we made it to school and went in the gate. 


I reported her to the school and the school officer for harassment, reckless driving, and throwing shit at my kids. I told my kids if you ever see this crazy bitch when you're riding alone, ride away. Just leave. If she follows you, go to the store or someone's house that you know. 


Friday, my husband rode with us and while I pointed out the Yeehawg-mobile, bitch didn't say a word to us. Just a dirty look from under a mountain of forehead fat and a mouthful of Mickey D's.

For reference, I’m a 17 year old female. My parents are divorced. I live in Florida with my mother and often visit my father and grandma in Illinois. I was 155 lbs down to 110 at 5’4”. I work out 5 days a week and eat healthy. 
 
A collection of quotes, short stories, and clap-backs: 


At the beach this (most likely intoxicated) woman said “she’s so skinny” to her son who’s about four years old and continued to stare at me in a sexual manner, making me cry, feel uncomfortable, and leave.

All of my family in Illinois are overweight, yet no one talks about it. However, my weight is fair game at family dinner. Sorry I only ate one piece of pizza while you had five dad, but we also both had chicken wings and mozzarella sticks with it.  

I get accused of being anorexic (15+ times). This is probably the most harmful comment because it makes me get emotional and want to binge-eat. 

“You’re really skinny you need to eat a footlong. No, you need to eat 5 footlongs” You need to stop eating footlongs, you’re mad you’ve gained weight and your husband won’t have sex with you anymore, Diane.

“Where’s the rest of you” My personality and heart are who I am, not my body. 

Every time I visit my grandma she says I’m getting smaller (I have been around the same weight for the past year). No g-unit, I’m not, you’re getting fatter.

I travel 10+ times a year on an open seating airline. If I’m lucky I’ll get an elderly couple next to me, but more often than not, hamplanets take advantage of my size. I wouldn’t mind if they didn’t come with a rancid smell or disrespect my personal space, but unfortunately most of them do. Just because I don’t take up all of my seat doesn’t give them permission to lift up the arm rest and pour onto it. Should I just rest my elbow on your fat then? Some are smart though, they know if they touch me with their fat I’ll slide over giving them more room to unload. It’s not over yet, after enduring the plane ride, I’m also greeted by exposed smelly buttcracks at face level when they exit the row.

I thought all of my insecurities would fade after losing weight, and for the most part they did, but now they are replaced by different ones. In Florida most of my peers have bikini bodies, because it’s easier to stay active in a warm climate and we go to the beach a few times a week when possible. I fit in with my peers and none of them judge me on my size. Adults (in Florida and Illinois) continuously project their own weight insecurities onto me, which is totally uncalled for on an impressionable teen. I was fat shamed by my family in Florida before losing weight and now I’m skinny shamed by my family in Illinois for losing weight. Thin privilege in 2019 is being skinny shamed and taken advantage of by obese people. 
",My Thin Privilege
fatpeoplestories,"Hi. I don't know if this belongs here because this is happening in reality show called Vanderpump rules, but I think that it pretty much belongs here because it's super fatlogic. And I can't discuss the fatlogic anywhere else because people start to come and blame genetics and rant that she's NOT overweight and BMI is a bad indicator of weight and that she's normal American woman (which in theory is still bad.) 

Katie Maloney is a cast of the reality show Vanderpump Rules. She used to be thin but then she gained weight. Look her up in 2018, she must be on overweight scale. 

So, Katie is very hateful towards girls who are skinnier than she is. She even says to her husband, ""I can't be like that other girl"" who works out pretty much all the time. Katie doesn't and is constantly saying how she can't look like ""these women."" 

She called skinnier girl slut because she thought that this girl wants to take her husband. 

In podcasts and on the show, she constantly says how much she loves her body. But when someone calls her fat, she starts to cry and is upset that she was ""body shamed."" 

Last season, she tried to pick a fight with a guy and he told her to lose weight (probably because he knew it will get her.) So she went and made their boss fire him because she didn't want that at her work place and she feels ""body shamed."" 

She claims that she loves her body yet is very upset when someone is thin, blames it on everyone else BUT her and everytime someone points her weight out, she goes crazy. She also constantly says on podcasts how she can't be thin anymore because she's older even though she's probably like 33. 

I'm so sick of people saying that she's normal American woman and it's genetics and sick of her trying to convince everyone that it's not her fault and that everyone attacks her and she's hiding behind fake ""body shaming"" thing. I don't even think she's ugly, but her fatlogic personality makes her ugly. I know it's hard to be on reality show, but if she minds it that much, she should just go on a diet.

fatpeoplestories,"Just happened and I’m furious. I was waiting for the subway today, and standing to the side with everyone else the way civilized human beings are supposed to, so people can easily get out.

The train was arriving when I saw a large man suddenly broke into what would’ve been a sprint from a healthier person, but was just this frantic waddle as he got down the escalator. 

He reached the train as the doors opened and people started getting out, and he started forcing his sweaty body forwards, pushing and shoving people out of the way, including me. And yes, I’m 6 months pregnant.

He’s so huge, he filled up nearly the entire door, so people were struggling to get out and it just created a human pileup. 

When I finally managed to get in, I saw he had taken up 2 priority seats since he couldn’t fit into one. I chose to stand since the rest are occupied by older people and I’m not kicking old people out of their seats even though some offered their seats to me while pointedly glaring at the asshole. I can still stand. Now this is the part that set me off the edge and turned the entire incident from mildly annoying to “holy crap I need to rant to the internet now”. 

 He saw me standing, caught my eye, and gave me a triumphant smirk.

Congratulations. You were a selfish prick who shoved people out of the way and caused a stupid delay, just to beat a pregnant woman to the priority seats. Glad you’re proud of yourself, you sad blob.",I'm 6 months pregnant and this large guy just shoved me so he could steal 2 priority seats.
fatpeoplestories,"I have two friends whom I adore. One is overweight and one is borderline obese. They're both more active than I am, especially the overweight girl, but they both eat way too much (especially junk food). The smaller girl has a gastrointestinal autoimmune disease that messes up her hunger signals so I get it, but it's really annoying hearing them constantly complaining about their weight and their ""slow metabolisms."" The overweight girl is even going to start taking appetite suppressants, which seems kind of dangerous to me. All they have to do is make better food choices! They each have a huge stash of junk food in their dorm rooms and they're going to room together next year, and I'm worried they might feed off each other's fat logic and do irreparable damage to their bodies.

fatpeoplestories,"I was Hawaii-bound and ecstatic when I checked in for the 8 hour flight to find an exit row seat for free.  It was an early morning departure and I was looking forward to stretching out and taking a nice, long nap on the way. Could this get any better?

I boarded the plane and was just starting to get comfortable when, to my horror, this absolutely massive lady proceeds to sit down next to me, accompanied by an average sized person that I assume is her son.  Forget the Island Luau, this woman is the whole hamplanet. 

Noticing her struggle, the son offers her the aisle seat . “Take it, take it now”,  says my inner monologue in a seething, near Satanic voice. She declines. I can feel my blood starting to boil as her boundless fat rolls are encroaching on what not long ago felt like ample space. Could this get any worse?

As the air kicks in the most foul of odors wafts under my nose and my eyes begin to water.  This had to be what death smells like.  I look down and see the most disgusting sores all over her arms. I suppose skin necrosis would smell like death. I was on the verge of tears when suddenly..

“I need a seat belt extender”, huffed the lady to the flight attendant, gasping for air after struggling with her seatbelt for a brief moment.

The flight attendant proceeded to tell her that she can’t sit in the exit isle if she could not get her seatbelt shut on her own. She started to squeal and scream at the flight attendant, ignoring the rational explanation about FAA regulations and launching into the most spectacular display of hamrage I’ve ever seen in my life. The entire plane fell silent. Time stood still. I was about to start recording a video because this had the potential to go viral. 

Suddenly, the son snapped out of his stunned stupor and realized they were on the verge of being kicked of the flight. He convinced her they needed to move and finally she agreed to switch seats. 

The flight wasn’t full. They got a row to themselves, and the middle seat next to me remained open.

fatpeoplestories,"Went to a bookstore to look around. As I was trying to navigate the store, there were 3 women standing in the Romance aisle. Let’s call them Woman A, B and C. 

Woman A - “Is there a book that teaches you how to have a love life??”

Woman B- “Well I think the secret is to just be lucky.”

At this point I was already walking past them when Woman A, very concerned, says “I never thought I’d have THIS much trouble dating. I mean. I DID get a little chubby.....” (she’s clearly overweight. Not a little chubby.)

Woman B strongly says “If someone doesn’t wanna date you because you put on weight.... That’s THEIR loss.” 

Of course Woman C passionately chimes in to back up Woman B. 

I couldn’t hear much at this point because we were walking opposite directions but Woman A started complaining and I heard her exclaim word for word “I’m like, the nicest person ever!!!”

I wouldn’t have thought much of this before I started browsing #fatlogic but now I view these types of things in a different light. 

Just.. the entitlement. All people want to attract a healthy, fit mate. Who wouldn’t? God forbid a mate who puts some sort of effort into their appearance, because I do believe appearance is going to matter, especially in the early dating stages. I’m not saying you have to be a model by ANY means... but this woman wasn’t wearing any makeup or anything (again, nothing wrong with that) but she also was wearing an oversized worn out T-shirt. Just because you may be on the heavier side doesn’t mean you can’t dress nice and present yourself well?? 

How come women are allowed to be picky and want a fit boyfriend, but men MUST love all women at every size or they’re a shallow asshole? And I just LOVE how it’s the MAN’S FAULT that he doesn’t want to date you because you’ve gained weight, it’s HIS FAULT that you’re unhealthy and it’s HIS LOSS. End rant.

fatpeoplestories,"Whew man, I’ll try to keep this as short as possible. 
 
Lunch break with coworkers, fine. We go to a small cafe near the office, fantastic. They have a large selection of drinks, protein bars, snacks, salads, sandwiches, whatever. 

I casually make a comment on whether or not I want a Kombucha or a La Croix. (Sue me????)

Overweight coworker (mind you, obese. I hate to say that, but she is) looks at me with a smirk/smile on her face and says “I hear carbonated water is bad for your bones!!!” 

Of course I’m too awkward and non-confrontational to make any sort of comment. Plus that would be rude tbh. 

But in my head-
A LA CROIX IS BAD FOR MY BONES BUT BEING A COUPLE HUNDRED POUNDS OVERWEIGHT ISNT? what about your JOINTS that have to support that weight ?????????????? 

It wouldn’t be an issue if this woman didn’t eat LITERALLY A 400 CALORIE CANDY bar in addition to her lunch??????????????? Not exaggerating. The bar she had was 400 calories. You aren’t really allowed to comment on my La Croix if you’re eating 50+ g worth of sugar for no reason. I don’t know. Maybe I’m just tired. Is this even the right sub for this???????

fatpeoplestories,"All right so, there was i (16 years old) , in  the first day of second year in high school. It seemed to be a... normal day, until the teacher announced a new student. she gave him the cue to enter the classroom. And then i see it. A ham-planet(?) the size of a fridge. an easy 200+ pounds, and my head didn’t even reach his shoulder (i am 5’3 feet), this guy just straight up TOWERED over everybody and everything. I wont say his real name, so we’ll call him: *H A N S*.

So, hans presented himself. He was NOT the neckbeard i was expecting. he said with a firm and clear voice: “MY NAME IS HANS AND I AM ** YEARS OLD, NICE TO MEET YOU ALL.” (His voice was strong, but... he wasn’t screaming) after that, he went and sat two places behind me. 

so, over the course of the next week, i made hans my friend. And i learned that: 1 he eats 10% of his weight every day, hence the fatness. 2 he is a powerhouse, even with all that flab, he didn’t even tire out in PE class. 3: he was a nice person. he would return favors as soon as he had the chance. He managed to be liked by everybody around him... except for one person.

There was another fat person in my classroom. We’ll call her... HAM. because she was a ham too, but, everybody else was taller than her and she was kind of a bitch with the “fat-shaming” accusations that she did every time she wanted attention from the SJWs and the teachers. However, she was less noticeable, now that hans was our friend, she couldn’t attempt to accuse us of anything anymore. Or so i thought.

One day, at one of our reunions with hans, we were at the cafeteria, and she went trough the door. and she tried to accuse us for the first time in the school year. Hell, her voice was shitty as fuck.

HAM: HeY, wHaT aRe YoU DoInG tO hIm!?           Me: we are chilling, why?         HAM: YoU aRe AtTeMpTiNg To BuLlY hIm!!!1!!1!

Me: ...no. right hans?          Hans: WHAT DOES SHE MEAN?             HAM:YoU aRe FaTsHaMiNg HiM!!!         Other friend: what?

HAM: yOu ArE MaKiNg HiM eAt NoThInG!!!  

This went on, for several seconds, apparently she was “concerned” about the fact that the box of chicken tenders (Tendies, where i come from) that we ordered for everyone only contained 1 tender. Although hans actually ordered extra pieces of chicken with his own money. (At this point, hans had already finished eating, and i was planning to eat that piece.) and she kept bitching around about how humans should eat more than that.

And then, something awoke inside hans, something powerful and determined. He knew that HAM was wrong in the first place. We all needed different amounts of food to survive and he only happened to eat more than the rest. He was perfectly aware of this. She tried to convince us that the fact that we don’t eat as much as hans was a crime. that disturbed the giant. Hans got up from the table, grabbed the chicken piece, faced HAM, and said: “WELL, EAT THIS.” Showing her the piece. She was startled by his voice. It was FAR louder than usual. 

HAM was frozen. This being that towered over her was starting to be aggressive. Hans was getting impatient. “EAT IT.” he said. at this point, the cafeteria was silent because of the sheer volume of that shout. she started backing up, but then, hans moved forward. he grabbed her and tried to shove the chicken piece up her mouth. she tried to fight back, but as they say, Hercules was strong, but even he couldn’t defeat a titan. And moments after that, hans was successful with his objective. The chicken was in her mouth. HAM was crying with the mouth full. She successfully ate the piece. Everybody including me was speechless. And then hans walked back to the table, looked at HAM dead in the eye, and said:

“IF EVERYBODY ELSE ATE AS MUCH AS ME, EVERYBODY WOULD BE DEAD.” he said with the force of a thousand suns.  

later after that, both HAM and hans were suspended for about 2 days. We backed hans up on his story and then the whole school knew that ham was far more of a bitch than everybody else thought. She was subjected to absolute amounts of bullying for the incident and everybody knew not to mess with... *HANS*. The end.
",THE FAT FAM
fatpeoplestories,"Hello, my little beetus-frosted cupcakes. I will regale you with another tale of CookieHam. Apologies for being absent, I am grieving the death of my fur baby while raising the new baby bun I just adopted this weekend, so my emotions are all over the place. This sub always gives me a good chuckle, and I never run out of CookieHam stories, so this is a little treat for you all. 

**Cast of Characters**
Me: 25/F. 5'1"". According to BMI charts I am overweight but not obese, looking to lose 20-30 lbs. Finally at my lowest weight in a year and I just got past a frustrating weight plateau this past week. Forcing myself to hit the gym for the first time in a week after being unable to leave my bed for several days due to crying/grief over my loss. 


Coworker aka CookieHam: 26/M. about my height, 260 lbs down from 300. Is doing a great job with the gym, but his eating habits could use some drastic improvement. We work at a sub shop together for context.


Grapefruit and Lemon: Husband and wife team who own SubShop. Both sticklers but nice people underneath the work persona.

Yesterday wasn't horribly busy, wasn't slow either. CookieHam and I are working together, I have one particularly annoying customer who won't get off her phone while ordering, then demands I re-cut her sandwich after wrapping it (while having me drench it in FOUR different sauces, disgusting), and the customer behind her apologizes for me having to deal with the rude customer and helps me deal with my frustration.

CookieHam is being his usual self and talking about how bad his knees hurt (muh conditions!), while I make a mental note to myself to hit the gym for a quick workout after work (We close at 9:30pm, I try to get to the gym as soon as I get out of work which is usually 9:45-10pm depending on how fast/slow CH waddles his fat ass out the door. My gym closes at 11pm during the week.). 

I make myself a normal meal (small turkey and cheese sandwich, baked chips, sugar free apple sauce), and decide I'll have one cookie today but none for the rest of the week, unless I eat light in comparison/it fits into my caloric budget. CookieHam notices that the cookie case is empty of two flavors. He is triggered.

I throw in more cookies of those flavors for the sake of the customers and for Grapefruit and Lemon, and when I put them in the case, I notice how perfectly cooked they are and am proud of my work. I know it's silly and it's a fast food job, but when things come out nice after I make them, I feel a small sense of pride. 

CookieHam is talking about how the Biggest Loser is a shitty show and that the contestants lose weight too quickly, and for once I actually agree with him that rapid weight loss is not sustainable, and how I aim to lose 1-2 lbs per week. He says this is good, and says ""I'm trying to lose weight slowly so I don't have to starve myself."" In theory, his idea is good. 

But CookieHam's idea of ""not starving himself"" is ordering a TWELVE pack of cookies as a ""drunk snack."" He had done this the previous night. (These are decent sized sub shop cookies, 200 cal each, think the kind you see in a grocery store.) And of course, I had to make CH's beloved cookies for him. 

Last night, he surprisingly didn't get any cookies, just a big chicken breast sandwich with cheese and veggies. I was pretty proud of him, hoping he'll stick to the diet and not eat mass amounts of cookies on a regular basis anymore.

But here's where my gripe comes in.

The sub shop we work at is VERY small. There is limited space to move around behind the counter. Normally when I work with G (he is about 6ft tall, of average weight, he and L are in their 50's), this isn't a problem. He is a normal sized human being and conscientious of other people around him, and easily able to move around. G is a vegetarian and watches his food intake, and L, while slightly overweight, is tall and swims laps. They are both in overall good health. 

CookieHam is almost impossible to work with because of the amount of space he takes up. He is always saying ""watch out"" to get past me because he knows he can't fucking fit behind me. I either have to turn sideways or completely step out of the way altogether, which affects my ability to serve customers and do my fucking job. I'm sick of having to literally walk around him on the sandwich line because he's working too slow and inefficiently, frustrating the customers. I'm sick and tired of his FUPA brushing behind me while I'm trying to clean or do prep work. And I'm sick of him sitting down every 15 minutes because his knees are bothering him (his own fault for being so fucking fat and damaging his knees when he's not even 30). 

He still continues to take 30 minute breaks while I get a 15 if I'm lucky, and my breaks are never uninterrupted. CookieHam will sit in the lobby in full view of the customers, refusing to get off his break no matter how busy we are, and make me handle a rush alone simply because I'm the only one out of the two of us who knows register. 

I know today's story wasn't very funny, more of a rant, but this is just an example of how selfish fat people can be and how they don't think their girth affects others. We work in a small space. CookieHam being so fat/working too slowly and sitting too much is affecting my job, causing me to become frustrated and angry, and putting most of the demand on me which cuts into my ability to have any sort of a lunch break while at work. 

I'm sorry if my story was terrible today, guys. I just had to get this out because I'm sick of CookieHam and his selfish/entitled behavior, and his fat logic isn't helping his weight loss at all, which he needs to do for the sake of others being able to move around him at work. 



**TL/DR**: 

Ham doesn’t understand how much space he takes up, apparently a dozen cookies as a snack is good for gradual weight loss.",CookieHam doesn't understand that his weight affects other people.
fatpeoplestories,I was the chubby brother. She felt weird and I felt good as I was down 40 pounds.,"Today I went to a client, left some boxes and she asked me how is your chubby brother? I haven't see him for long."
fatpeoplestories,"My dears, it has been a while. Gather round and prepare, an epic journey awaits. Sorry it’s long, but an exposition of this level cannot be glossed over. 

Ah, air travel. The packed airports, baggage claim thunderdome, the boarding group 5 members who crowd the jetway as soon as group 1 is called. Paradise. My favorite part however, is the leg room afforded to us bottom feeders in the Depths of Tartarus - I mean economy. I am over 6’ and have tendinitis in both of my soccer-destroyed knees. It is always a pleasant experience. 

I knew nothing of the horrors awaiting me. 

Recall if you will the holidays so recently passed. That time of year which brings us such happiness, joy, and mothers insulting your every choice in life over the cranberry sauce. 

In the midst of my personal hell-holiday-time, I found myself crammed into the middle seat in the second to last row of economy. My knees were already screaming, and my internal monologue quickly joined as the thundering of two Hams who had entered the tiny metal flying object came to a stop at my row. 

The farmlands of Ohio had coughed up two off-brand Texas Chainsaw Massacre denizens of the Ham variety and spat them at the feet of my poor, innocent self. 

The male equivalent of the two grunts something unintelligible, and I politely ask him to repeat himself. He rolls his eyes and tilts his globular head back in exasperation, stretching his three chins so they appear as one unified mass in disgust at my inconvenience:

“Yeah can you get up? This our row.”

I get up and try to exit the row, a fairly difficult task as they are giving me almost no room to slide out. I manage to squeeze out, but like a scratch and sniff sticker from hell, body contact makes the smell worse, and the fragrance of a long unwashed body, manure, and cheese assaults my very existence. 

The female sits against the window, I watch in horror as she raises the armrest and a cascade of what I would say is her right lovehandle (rather, lovehandles) flows into the middle seat. The male wastes no time in performing the same horrific ritual in the aisle seat. 

Like a car crash, I can’t tear my eyes away from what used to be my seat completely obscured by the deluge of their Ham now free flowing from the clutches of the armrests. 

As this has been unfolding, the rest of the plane had boarded and I became aware of a nasally voice commanding me to take my seat. Putting on the most pitiful facial expression I can manage, I turn to the flight attendant and attempt to explain the issue via desperate eye flicking movements from the Hams, to the middle seat, and back at her where they settle into a gaze of fear and panic. 

Smirking in smug enjoyment of her power that only exists in this metal cylinder, she says the plane is full so sit down. NOW. 

To describe the noises and smells that followed as I squished myself back into my seat would make even those with an iron stomach nauseous. Suffice to say, neither Ham was happy, and one of them had been busily farting as they situated themselves. I tried to make myself as small as possible, but my body joined my soul in being crushed from head to toe between the supremely unconcerned, sweaty, sticky, Hams. An uncomfortable warmth enveloped me. 

After the out of body experience of takeoff, we reach cruising altitude and I shot out of my seat like a horse at the races. Clambering over male Ham, I nearly head butted an elderly woman in my rush to find a more reasonable flight attendant. I was hoping to have the conversation about moving my seat in private, but my luck continued taking a vacation as from behind me I hear “can I help you?” 

The imagined overlord from before is behind me with her arms crossed and a raised eyebrow. I ask if there are any other seats available, as I’m having...difficulties with my current location. 

Something awakens in male Ham and he attempts to rise up in revolt, but his considerable girth bumps up against the seat in front of him and he flops back down, likely dropping our altitude by a couple thousand feet. He begins to honk at me, emphasizing syllables at random.

“What is YOURRRR problem???? We tEW FAAAYYYYYYT for you?!?!” 

You said it, not me. 

“We bought this ROW and tTHEEEEen YOU SAT THERE and took up OUR SPAce. You CAINt get a new seAT, that’s DE SCRIM EH NAY SHUN! I WANT A VOWWWWWCHAIR”

He continues causing a ruckus, and his voice steadily increases in volume as he assaults my character, clothing, mother (ok that’s fair), airline/seat/life choices, etc. alongside demanding a Holy Vowchair. His face is turning red, sweat is beading on his forehead, and his diatribe is punctuated increasingly by gasps for breath. 

The noise brings other FA’s to the barnyard, and finally one turns to me as I stand there fixated on the Ham with more than mild revulsion, and asks what the problem is. Ham answers him with another lengthy moo about my skinny white (he’s white too?) dumb ass discriminating against them because they’re big boned and that he expects vowchairs from the airline for the pain caused by me....*pause..jowls quiver*....that DEESGUSTING BITCH. 

Them’s fighting words, but I lost the ability to care somewhere in their folds of flesh, so I tell the FA the part-truth with a quavering voice. Sir no I don’t know at all what that man is so mad about, it’s just my knees are injured, they’re killing me and is there any way I can be relocated as I don’t think I’ll make it through the flight without extreme pain. 

He takes pity on me and moves me up about 15 rows to economy plus, and I see that the FA from earlier was lying as there are a number of open seats. Surrrrrprise. 

I can still hear Ham screeching about his vowchair and his family’s genetics as I get settled. The FA comes over and asks what I’d like to drink, he says it’s on the house so that means alcohol and I gladly take him up on it. He comes back with my drink and as he places it on my table thing, he whispers “knee issues aside, you definitely needed to be rescued from that” and straightens up, blessing me with a wink before walking down the aisle. 

I consider proposing to him, and the rest of the flight passes uneventfully. I nearly managed to escape the airport without any further Ham confrontation, but as I neared baggage claim I was passed by one of those golf cart things. To literally no one’s surprise, solely the Hams were on it as there was no room for another body. 

As they pass, a dim bulb of recognition lights up within the cavernous male Ham and I am treated to the verbal representation of total implosion as he gets so upset he can’t formulate words so just starts making some sort of howl-screech at me. I cheerily flick him off and watch as his face purples in outrage. I’m usually more mature than that (read: barely) but I had had enough of those motherfucking Hams, on that motherfucking plane. 

The sight of him being spirited away and around the corner by the cart that was sagging under his and the other Ham’s weight, while him singing the song of his people fades away...‘twas art.

fatpeoplestories," 

A year ago my close friend went vegan. 

She went from eating carbs, sugar and highly processed meats, so a diet of 100% carbs in huge excess, going from 160lbs to 190 or even 200lbs in a few months. 

V started off with a bad first impression but she was funny, interesting, brilliant to be around and I still count her as a great friend I’d like to stay with. But we shared a sixth form timetable, meeting for free classes and break-times and the stress of A Levels took a toll on her diet and her shirt buttons. 

We both began overweight (myself 160 with F cups and a normal shape, yes I’m excusing, my own fatness a bit) , and continued to get worse, but the example V set made my upset few cookies look like nothing. In our shared breaks we would make multiple trips to the convenience store, after she would buy a six pack of crisps in the morning and be finished before lunch. Sausage rolls would disappear before we had made the five minute walk back to school, and at the beginning of term she made it a habit for one afternoon a week to go for chips (chunky french fries in a huge portion). I would offer my morning muffin to friends at break, and pretend to protest as they took the biggest chocolate chips, only to have V take a handful of muffin, squishing it, crumbling it around with her whole hand, eat it, lick her fingers and return for more. She would roll it around in her mouth and mush it against her teeth with her mouth open. It was a great system, because I couldn’t eat anymore fatty muffin treats afterwards, I felt so queasy. 

She insisted she was an athlete, running at her old school, the best at throwing, and in her defense I watched her do a perfect cartwheel while drunk. But on our little walks from the shop she would wheeze and pant and spit out food bits as she talked because she ate too fast to breathe, even over the few hundred yards. She could finish three bags of crisps by the time we got back, eating them in handfuls not individual chips, and finish the other three bags in sandwiches for her lunch. One day before lunch, she said with a shocked voice“I’m so hungry from not having breakfast, my stomach is actually rumbling.” I hadn’t the heart to tell her it was supposed to for every meal, and i skipped breakfast every morning, but she didn’t notice my face was unmasked shock. 

Then she turned vegan, and it got worse. At first, i was excited. I’m not vegan but i support the decision for respecting animals and helping the environment one cow fart at a time. But after all my interesting recipe links, our talks about surprising vegan foods (chicken flavour instant noodles wtf), our full support, and her mother letting her cook whatever she wanted, she stuck to her habits. Carbs. Multiple portions of chips a day. Crisp sandwiches on top of lunch. Pre-prepared pasta big enough for Michael Phelps. Three packs of peanuts, each over 750 calories a day, more if she claimed she hadn’t eaten all weekend. In her defense, she probably didn’t eat any meals because she failed to cook anything interesting or fun, but snacked her way to obesity.It turns out she doesn’t like veg. I would understand a few basic veggies yes, but she refuses to eat or experiment with any vegetables at all, even pasta sauces sometimes had too much tomato. Instead it was the exact same oven chips and veggie sausages that came to at least £15 a day just in food. 

Sitting drunkenly with some sober friends and I, she showed me the stretch marks on her arms and complained she had no idea how it happened. I told her, gently to her face, that she probably eats too many carbs and maybe she should try mixing in more veg. She proceeded to eat a whole cheeseless pizza, then salt-n-pepper chips, with her syrupy alcohol drink. She ate through uniform blouses,with her boobs bulging out, belly pressed against the buttons, work trousers because her skirt grew too small. 

She smelt. Even before our brief walks, if she got too warm she would sweat profusely and remove her blazer so it wafted into our faces, putting her hair up regularly to ensure her pits got a good airing. It didn’t smell unusual, just meaty, sweaty BO, even with regular showers, I don’t think she used deodorant and the wet patches in her shirts made me feel ill. 

So i went on holiday with her. I liked her, even though friends would talk behind her back in front of me, I’ll admit she wasn’t perfect. But this is about her fattiness. We went to a hot island. Which gosh was a mistake, if she got warm in the UK summer she could have made pork crackling out of her bikini body on holiday. She was entirely unashamed, with revealing posts on all her social media, and three of four bikinis and suits, one of which she literally was falling out of sideways. I envied her confidence, and it was the first holiday i got a bikini that fitted even with size ten bottoms and an f cup top, and i struggled to let myself enjoy it next to a considerably fatter friend. I noticed then, that i had a great lot of assets up top, and was just too chubby elsewhere. I also noticed that V had no assets, a sticking out belly past her boobs, and terrible stretch marks. I will admit i started to feel more confident about myself off putting her down, and i felt terrible. 

The problems on holiday made it awkward with her mother and grandmother. To start with, her mother was terrible, treating her as if she was a toddler, reminding her to wash her hands after going to the loo, and as naturally as if they did it all the time, V acted like a toddler. She would sit in restaurants sulking over portions of chips she begged for when we were alone. Whenever we went for a meal, she would sulk and moodily refuse to contribute to making decisions as we went out of our way to try and find vegan options, wandering around for ages while hungry and tired. After V stropped off once, i suggested I’d help her find a specific vegan place we could go to, but as the one with dietary requirements, she had to be the one to help, not just refuse to help and sulk we weren’t at her every beck and call. In return, her attempt was sending me the google search link for vegan restaurants. I commended her attempt, did some research myself, and instead we went for chips and focaccia at a pizza place because she didn’t want to walk too far. The one activity she was excited for was to take segways along the beachfront. We went into the local town downhill, a distance of less than a kilometre, and for drinks or food every time, and she insisted we get a five euro back uphill every time rather than walk twenty minutes. I swam laps around the pool slowly, while she jumped, splashed and returned to her sunlounger to read on her phone. When she ended up too drunk on a night out, she chowed down on a huge portion of chips while complaining of being ill, then vomited all over the pavement and whined and cried to guilt us into telling her what she wanted to hear. It was uncomfortable to say the least. She ate an entire pack of pistachios, and continued on mine without my permission, in order to make a rattle filling up a pringles can with shells. When i suggested she just save the nuts rather than eat them and hardly chew before she grabbed the next, she shrugged and carried on anyway. But we had a good time. Despite this I supported her efforts to try and be healthy, and I enjoy her company. But I lost an awful lot of hope after that, and to my knowledge not much has changed since i left for Uni.

fatpeoplestories,"Every New Year I help take a group of students to a warm island to study its environment. This warm island is a popular destination for UK tourists. We stay in a massive hotel with lots of them. It'd be nicer to stay somewhere more authentic but there's a lot of us and it's cheap and easy.

I don't have a specific story, but this year I particularly noticed the size of the clientele, perhaps because I've lost weight myself. I'm not kidding but 80%+ of the people in that hotel were overweight. (Not the staff, that was very clear.)

By the end of the week I was finding it very depressing watching people swarming over the buffet piling their plates high with mismatched food. There's food available all day from 7am to 11pm - when the dining room's not open there's a room with snacks, and there's always crisps and peanuts at the bar. People are grazing like cows. And what's worse, the alcohol's free too (the infamous ""all inclusive holiday"") and you can imagine what alcohol on tap does for riff raff who feel off the leash.

I'm sounding like a snob, I know. I mean, each to their own, and if you want to have a simple holiday where you just lie roasting by the pool, having a nice drink, and eating food where you don't have to make it or do the washing up - that's fine. That's great. But en masse it starts looking very unsophisticated, it starts looking like you're stuffing as much into your face as possible just because it's there. It's not civilised behaviour. And for most people who were there, this clearly wasn't a habit they reserved for relaxing on their holiday.

My group does stick out like a bit of a sore thumb amongst the other guests. And this year I got a noticeable number of comments from the students that they were getting mean looks and remarks from some of them. Previously I would have put it down to some sort of reverse-snobbery where the sight of someone intelligent trying to better themselves might be getting their backs up. But this year I wondered whether it might be more about the size of us all - a couple of us might be considered A Little Chunky but no-one's fat, and the vast majority are slim (some even witnessed in the hotel gym doing actual exercise). Maybe that's what made us stand out most. (that and our rucksacks). So maybe it was a different type of jealousy.

There's all this stuff about fat activism and how people shouldn't be mean to those who are overweight because, well, condishuns, and anyway they're really happy with their size. But I'm starting to realise that there's a lot of defensiveness and vitriol going the other way too.

(Another thing I discovered was that the 'towels on sunloungers' thing is true. I saw people waddling over to make a huge queue on the other side of the road at 8.45 and thought they were waiting for the bus. But they disappeared through a gate into the hotel's garden. Then not 5 minutes later they were back and heading down for breakfast (jaw droppingly, you can get fizzy wine at breakfast. And people do). The island is full of amazing things but I imagine at least half the guests have literally no idea they exist. Though given the fact you'd have to walk around to see them, it'd be a bit of a non-starter anyway if you were quite portly).

People eh. I'm sorry if this is a bit of a vague story. I wanted to tell you as I just feel a bit depressed now. It's kind of from seeing such behaviour en masse. Oh yes, depressed apart from the fact I managed to lose another 2lb during the week with all the walking about and despite the buffet!! Hah.

So HR have decided to put more up.

fatpeoplestories,"I currently weigh 483lbs, down from 545lbs over the summer. My entire life has been plagued by food addiction, cigarette addiction, and an overwhelming want to just sit and do nothing. Over the summer I bought a Fitbit and started walking a lot and eating better. Life changed for me and it was going great, until depression and the food addiction came back. I dieted and exercised consistantly from July to October, but between October and December I almost completely fell off, gaining back 10lbs in the process. As of December 1st I started slowly getting my shit together and am now a few pounds lighter. It's hard. Every single day is hard, but it has to be worth it. I've never had a real active sex life, like I've slept with a few woman and fooled around a lot, but due to my size and terrible circulation from smoking and weight things are difficult. In fact the woman I'm seeing now, off and on since my diet started, has sort of nonchalantly put me into the friend zone because I can't actually have sex with her. So not having those issues, general health problems, and finally being able to do things most people view as normal are very motivating. I just really wanted to get this off my chest.

Bumble's great, overall, and it seems women have gotten the message to start in with more than 'hey how are you?' or 'hey,' and instead went with: 'what's the last Netflix series you spent all day binging?' 

Now, unfortunately, she's huge in the way that makes her subject material, and I'm huge in a very different way, but hid it behind some deceptive photos.

I told her The Expanse and she asked what it was like, I gave it a quick 'oh, I like it, feels a bit like the old Firefly series,' yada yada. Then I paged through the rest of her pics. She'd listed herself 'active,' and kept talking about biking. I've been real tired of being ball-and-chained by partners who want a fit partner, and then want to feed them crap and sit around all day.

So then I asked: 'what was the last big bike ride you spent all day riding or hard day of physical training?'

But at approx 5 ft 2 and I don't know her weight at her heaviest but she managed to lose like 9st after the events I'm about to divulge which is a whole fucking person so you can imagine (about a uk size ten after the weight loss).






Laura was my ex boyfriends sister and I ate at their house often when I stayed over night. Boyfriend was tall and skinny, same as mum and dad was short but just a beer belly and I'm by clinical standards overweight myself. One night we had nachos and chilli for dinner and mid meal while everyone was eating what they already had on our plates, Laura begins picking the cheese and topping off the nachos with her fingers, all of it, laughs and goes ""was everyone finished with the nachos hahaha"", I was too baffled to say anything and no one else did. 






One night me and the bf decided to order a takeaway for ourselves and I ordered a 12""chicken tikka chasni pizza because favourite curry+pizza=wow. 







So I have like half the pizza and leave it on top of the microwave for later; we would wait till his mum went to sleep and then smoke a few joints in the garage and I was saving the pizza for my munchies later (any stoner will know how sacred your munchie food is at the critical time it hits). 







Me and bf have been in the garage smoking and head back in through the kitchen so I grab my pizza box to take upstairs, hmmm it's light for 4 slices left. 







I open the box and all that remains is 2 crust and 1 half eaten slice and one with just 1 bite taken out of it. I was furious but it was like 1am and not my home and she'd slunk off to her bedroom by this point so I couldn't confront her. 







Asked about the pizza the next day and while giggling she explained it looked so good but after 2 slices it was a bit too sweet so she left the last slice, I said there were four slices, ""oh, laurasboyfriend took a bite and didn't like it"".







So not only did you steal my food, you wasted it and instead of offering him a bite of the slice you couldn't finish, ensured that I wouldn't even have one slice of pizza left? MY PIZZA?! MYYYYY PIZZA?

fatpeoplestories,"Having a blast on my throw away because I decided to stop lurking and casual posting. On to my opinion.
After 14 months, I am in the normal range weight category. Yay for me. Actually, this sub was a huge inspiration and I thank you. Most of you, anyways.

You see, I realized that despite NEVER changing my behavior, people started being so sweet and kind to me! It took me a while to realize that as I lost weight, I was transitioning from vermin to human-worthy-of-respect status. Then I started to get irritated reading these posts because some of these posts can be applied to a skinny person and have it not change the context. In fact, some were literally just “UGH! This fat guy stood behind me and took up SO much space! I mean he was polite and quiet, BUT HE WAS FAT SO-“ 
Anyways, I think it’s kind of despicable I was deprived of basic human respect despite being a hyper-polite and shy type because I always cared about how others think of me. My view of people is changed permanently now.
Next time a fat person pisses you off, please reflect on wether or not if it’s because they’re acting fat, or if it’s because you just don’t like how they look, cause that fat person WAS me. And I’ve always been a normal, polite person. I deserved human compassion before I lost weight.  

Thanks.

fatpeoplestories,"Hello, my little donut holes. Today's tale will be a snack-sized one. I am ***very*** frustrated with CookieHam. Pretty sure he got me sick.

**Cast of Characters**

Me: 25/F. 5'1"". According to BMI charts I am overweight but not obese, looking to lose 20-30 lbs. Last I checked I was at my lowest weight in a year. (Unfortunately I gained 3 lbs from 2 weeks ago due to the holidays and all dat beetus, but I'm back on my produce-heavy diet and workout regimen.) 

Coworker aka CookieHam: 26/M. about my height, 260 lbs down from 300. Is doing a great job with the gym, but his eating habits could use some drastic improvement. We work at a sub shop together for context.

Grapefruit and Lemon: Husband and wife team who own SubShop. Both sticklers but nice people underneath the work persona. 

Yesterday, I wasn't even scheduled to work with CookieHam. It was originally supposed to be me and a newer kid who's been doing a great job so far, and I've been training him when the owners leave for the day. I had closed with him the night before. I'll call this kid Peter. 

Well, Peter called off apparently, so who do G and L call in to work yesterday? CookieHam. And surprise, he has a cold. A bad one.

As soon as I get to work, he's hacking *all over the place*. It's fucking disgusting. Yesterday wasn't slow, but wasn't busy either.  Just a normal day at SubShop. 

A family buys a ton of cookies as soon as I walk in, so G tells me to make more. I do so, and the batch includes CH's favorite flavor, peanut butter. This will be relevant later on.


I finish making my dinner to take home (veggie wrap with guac and cheese, a bag of baked chips, and a small apple), and pack it in the cooler, putting my salad and other apple on the desk to eat on my ""lunch break"" (we get 15 minute breaks for shifts under 8 hours, but working with CookieHam, getting an actual break is a toss up). 

I'm doing prep work and CookieHam is doing dishes. The doorbell rings, it's a customer, I go out and serve them because CookieHam is pouting and refusing because he's sick. 

After I serve the customer (they could unfortunately hear CH hacking up a lung from the back), I take a couple bites of my salad, wanting to sit down for just 5 minutes while I eat, pause my break, and go back to working. (I decided to split up my break, knowing what CookieHam would do). 

Do I get to sit down? Of course not! CookieHam, while hacking up phlegm, says he needs to sit, and his FUPA shoves me off the chair. He is coughing all over my food. 

I sigh and shake my head and finish the rest of the prep and cleaning. I eventually got to finish my 15 minute break (split up into 3's, of course), and CookieHam has not only sat down about a total of 7 times so far, he wants a **FULL 30 MINUTE BREAK.** He announces he is doing this, I don't protest because I just want to get shit done. He makes his sandwich, and I continue prep work in the back. I figure his appetite will be reduced due to his cold. LOL, NOPE.

""Um...BUNNY!"" Bellows the ham from the front, ""I WANT COOKIES!"" I shake my head and head up there, and I ask how many and what kind. ""6 peanut butter."" He says. Again, CookieHam? Well thankfully I had baked plenty of each flavor, and his 6 left 4 peanut butter left in the case. Your ""usual"" should not be 6 fucking cookies at a fast food restaurant, especially if you plan on eating all (or most of them) at once. He ate over 1300 calories worth of cookies.

Right after he finishes devouring his cookies and I stock the chips, CookieHam comes quickly waddling to the back. He says ""I'm gonna be in the bathroom for a WHILE, if you know what I mean."" He chuckles and waddles to the bathroom. 

He is in there for at least 10 minutes, I hear retching and ass trumpeting sounds. Fuck, it was disgusting. I was trying not to throw up. He HAD to have his energy though, guise. He eventually came out, sweaty and red-faced.

The rest of the night went pretty smooth/slowly. I did counts, closed the register, and cleaned, and CH finished dishes, but other than his break he sat down about 11 times. 

Now I woke up with a stuffy nose and a scratchy throat. Thanks, CookieHam. 

**TL/DR** C is for cold, but more importantly, cookie. ","A CookieHam morsel: The Cold, The Excuses, and (of course) the cookies."

When i was really young (about 6-7 years old) my family started to put a lot of weight on me (no puns ei) because of my own weight at the time. I was not obese for sure but a bit chubby though.

Everything that used to bother me they would tell me that that shame, anger and isolation came from the shame of being a fat child... Turns out i found out that a have autism, but at the time no one knew about it.

This is such a sad memory: once i was really bothered because i wanted to go to a playground but hated the idea of noise, interaction and other kids doing stuff out my Control and watching me being ""weird"". I gave up the idea very quickly and started crying for not being able to have fun the way i wanted. My father started screaming saying ""Oh you're sad?! Why Don't you eat a whole bag of candy?! You're gonna smile wide i bet! You're fat because you want to! Stop eating junk and stop crying!""

Not only my parents would scream at me blaming a 6 year old for being fat and frustrated over It but also my brothers started to do the same.

 They would say things such ""You're only feeling down lately because of all this weight, if you get skinny you're gonna be happy"" or ""Don't you wanna lose weight? You are going to be so happy and even pretty if you do so!""

As a 6 year old i couldn't understand why this certain topic was so important to get rid of all my sad moments... It happened when i was 6, 7, 8, 9 and so on until 15!

At 15 my dad needed to lose some weight to do a Bariatric Surgery (and he was the one telling me i was fat enough), i decided to do some exercises to help him and eat the same foods just to be supportive.

This is no news but I LOST SOME HEAVY POUNDS and, out of nothing, like that, just a blink, my life changed drastically! People wanted to get to know me, guys and girls would ask for my number, even getting called beautiful by people i just met. Looked like all the clothes were designed for me!

But still i was not happy.

I got really disapointed because my family kept telling me (DURING NINE YEARS NONE STOP) i would find all the answers after being perfectly shaped... But there i was with no answers or great feelings at all. I was the same person, with the same personality, super shy, hated loud noises...

Getting someone to flirt with you it's good for your ego but... That was pretty much it.

I was disapointed with the internal results but at the same time i couldn't let myself go and get the weight back! 
I mean, everyone saw me being ""all beautiful and stuff"" and turn back the way i was would only push people away from me even more, i could almost hear them saying:

""Yep! She's getting ugly again""

That was when my battle against Bulimia started.

THE WORST TIME OF MY LIFE.

How could i get so depressed after reaching my biggest aspiration?!  It made no sense! I did everything they told me! EVERYTHING! What went wrong?

After trying to kill myself over the paranoia of eating and counting calories i could NOT do that any longer. I just let myself go and gained the weight back, i felt like i was dead and lied to.

From time to time i see myself exercising, counting calories and doing that thing that Bulimia tells you to do after a short period of time  eating junk like a pig.

I go back and forth. Skinny. Obese.

It does not matter which fase i'm going through... I'm in pain and paranoia.

Can some of you try to explain what happened?! I got skinny, i GET skinny from time to time... Why can't i be happy like these people on YouTube that lose weight ONCE and suddely their life is all made up?!

Do someone out there has ever felt that too?

fatpeoplestories,"I don't know her current stats because I haven't seen her, and this girl deserves a bit of sympathy because her mother did try to starve her skinny when she was a teenager.  She's also one of a group and remembering her as the figurehead of many voices is unfair.

I tend to say things like ""fat people deserve the right to be fat, they shouldn't be trying to convince everyone else that being fat is perfectly fine and healthy"" and ""fat people shouldn't be taking up the provided scootypuffs at stores.""  

I think it was someone else who thought that ""scootypuff"" was really offensive.  Another someone else was insisting that calorie counting was disordered eating.  (There were a few people who chimed in that they used calorie-counting to make sure they ate enough even though they had no appetites.)

Things I attribute to the figurehead are things like ""you can't tell a person's health just by looking at them"" which I am HAES-positive about in a medical setting.  (Health problems should not be dismissed with ""lose weight"" but I'm also scared that if my weight is the problem the doctor will be afraid to call it to my attention.  I did get pretty fat without noticing how bad it got.)  I also don't approach people on the street to criticize and explained that I don't... because I would hit that statistical anomaly where it actually is genetics, chronic illness, or because of medication.  She also asked me why it's my business, and I can't remember what my responses were or if I just gave up.

They know I'm a person of size.  They don't seem to respect that beyond difficulty in finding clothes and having plantar fasciitis that would be improved if I lost at least 60 pounds, I don't hate my body.  Actually, I'm in a semi-delusional state where my self-image is 60 pounds lighter and glancing at myself in a full-length mirror produces a very temporary dissatisfaction.  I am not going to correct the delusion on the mental angle until I've tried to adjust the body by dieting.

Coworker aka CookieHam: 26/M. about my height, 260 lbs down from 300. Is doing a great job with the gym, but his eating habits could use some drastic improvement. We work at a sub shop together for context.

CookieHam and I both started at 2 yesterday. We were working the closing shift (we close at 9:30). All should be well, right? I packed a salad and some apple slices as my lunch, and would probably make something to take home to eat (perks of working at a food establishment, you can get creative with what you make yourself).

Before it got super busy, our owner who I will call Grapefruit is explaining the prep work we need to do, and is telling us to make more soup because we sold out earlier. I grab the soup from the back and chuck it in the microwave so it'll be ready. I make myself a veggie wrap with extra cheese, guac, and various other veggies, and get myself some chips and a diet coke to take home with the other half of my apple. 

CookieHam sees what I am making for myself and says, ""Ugh, ew. What is that?"" Me: ""This is my dinner I'm taking home. I had a veggie sub like this the other day and it was really good, I just don't want all the bread, so I'm making a wrap."" CookieHam: ""Why would you want to eat food that your food eats?!"" (CookieHam thinks being vegetarian/vegan is a ""disease"", his words, not mine). Me"" -shrug- ""I'm not always in the mood to eat meat, and I love cheese."" CookieHam harrumphs and continues on with the prep work. 

After I finish making my dinner and pay for it, we get SLAMMED. I put on my best CustomerService^TM voice and help them, I can see CookieHam is getting overwhelmed, and is pissed because he can't get to the dishes (he takes over dish when we work together, and he's good at it so I don't have a problem with it). I tell him that dishes will have to wait because we have customers, he huffs and gets back on the line. 

This rush lasts for 3 solid hours. We constantly run out of things and hurry to the back to get more, and in between customers we do more prep work. I'm getting hungry, so I quickly grab my salad and apple from the back, set it on Grapefruit's desk and take a few quick bites and a drink when I get a call from Lemon (the owner's wife, she also owns the shop) saying I need to bake more cookies and bread. I hop on it quickly while CookieHam continues to serve customers, and scarf furiously quick bites as I do so. I figure I'm not getting a sitting down break today, and that's fine as long as I get some food in my system. 

The rush starts all over again. We get a family that orders 7 sandwiches, and they're very nice with us and we get the sandwiches made ASAP, I cash them out for their order (over $60 worth of food, they got sides and drinks too), they thank us and we wish them a good night. 

Another horde of customers later, my cookies come out and the bread is still rising. I take the cookies out as I continue to help another customer, who is being a bit smug and arrogant but I try to ignore his attitude. CookieHam isn't subtle about being annoyed at Mr. Smug Customer. He slams things all over the place, right in front of the guy. I finish making his sandwiches, ring him out, and now we are behind on tasks. 

Me, taking bites of my salad again and getting more water while continuing to work and pull more bread: ""OK CookieHam. Here's how tonight is going to go. We can't really get sitting down breaks today. We can eat, but we can't really sit down."" (We get a 15 min break for a 6-7 hour shift, a 30 minute for a 8+ hour shift. CookieHam has been taking adavantage and taking 30+ minute breaks for a 6-7 hour shift). 

CookieHam: But muh knees, Bunny! I HAVE to sit down and calm down. This is fucking BULLSHIT!"" He continues to scream and throw a fit, throwing dishes, etc. 

Me: ""Fine. Do what you want. I have to get this bread ready. We're so busy that we're literally running out of bread."" 

CookieHam goes to make himself a sandwich, which is a normal chicken breast sandwich with cheese and veggies on whole grain, but then... he's CookieHam, so you can guess what happens next. 

I'm stretching the bread to put it in the rising/pre-baking process, and CookieHam bellows from the front, ""HEY BUNNY! I need you to ring me out up front!""

Now, small sandwiches are free to employees while on shift, but big sandwiches, sides, drinks, wraps, and salads we have to pay for. I figure he got his sandwich, he must want some chips or a drink. Nope, he wants cookies. Again. 

CookieHam: ""Give me 6 peanut butter cookies.""

Me: ""That's all that's left in the case, you know Lemon is gonna have us make more since you're getting them all."" (Mind you, these are decent sized cookies, over 200 calories each). 
CookieHam: ""I know, I'm hungry!"" 

I sigh and ring him up while he goes to sit down with his cookies. I continue working like a mad woman so we don't fall behind, and throw in more cookies.

I'm sweaty,thirsty, and pissed, and taking the last few bites of my salad and apple while I continue working, running to get more water while I keep an eye on the cookies and bread. It would be nice if I could sit down for 15 minutes, and if CookieHam didn't take advantage of the break policy. Also, I wasn't trying to be a ham, but all I wanted was ONE peanut butter cookie. And he had to take them all because they were there and he didn't want anyone else to have any. 

My peanut butter and white chocolate cookies are done, I set them on the cooling rack and help ANOTHER rush of customers while CookieHam sits snarfing his food down on his break, staring at his phone, in full customer view. The lady I am serving stares at CookieHam and wonders why I am working alone. 

Finally, at the end of the night, we die down. CookieHam eventually got off his ""break"" about 35 minutes later. We were completely out of our most popular bread, but we were insanely busy earlier and most customers understood. I stock the chips, and go to the back. I'm tired and wanting to sit for just a few minutes. I also buy myself one peanut butter cookie after they've cooled off, and leave the other 5 in the case for customers. (I had just sold some fresh chocolate chip to a family with a kid who was VERY happy to get them, it made me smile that a kid could be so happy over a cookie). 

Me: ""Hey CookieHam, would you mind if I sat down for just 10 minutes?""

CookieHam: ""Uhhhh. If you sit down it'll delay us getting out on time, and I know you're in a hurry!"" 

To be fair, I was in a hurry. I wanted to get to the gym after work, and they closed at 11pm, so the sooner I got there the better. But come on, man. My feet hurt too. I also have back and neck problems due to scoliosis, but I pushed through.

I sighed, forgot about my break, and pulled more bread to bake for tomorrow. We cleaned up, and I hurried up and closed the register, did counts etc after we were officially closed.

CookieHam had gone on and on about how we were getting out ""so late tonight."" We got out EXACTLY on time, only because I didn't sit down once, and continued to eat my meal as I worked and served customers. 

Woke up this morning with my feet throbbing. That's what I get for making up for someone else's laziness I guess. 

TL/DR: Hammy, cookie-addicted coworker takes advantage of the break policy while I get no break. We have an unusually busy rush all shift long, he still takes a long break while I don't get a break at all. 
","CookieHam, the dinner rush, and his long break (and I get none)."
fatpeoplestories,"It's been a while since I've posted here but here's a brief encounter. There are two people involved here: let's call them Lisa (50kg/110lb) and Karen (somewhere around 120kg/264lb), both about 1.6m/I'm too lazy to do the mental maths to convert to feet. 

Some backstory, I was well on my way to planetary status. I was 139kg/306lb this time last year and currently 90kg/199lb and still losing. I'm aiming to lose more but have lost enough for it to be a pretty noticeable change to the people who haven't seen me in a while. 

I work and live at a horse rescue (we need staff on site 24/7 in case of emergencies plus it's beautiful around here) and we are surrounded by small farms. One of our neighbours invited everyone in the area to gather on New Year's Eve around sunset to just relax and enjoy a quiet evening at their dam. They had a shelter, basically a thatched roof on four poles and we only needed to bring something to sit on and some snacks.

I arrived along with my boss and her husband and we started to greet and catch up with everyone. Karen spots me and squeals about how much weight I've lost since she last saw me and asks how much I've lost up to now. My boss pipes up that it's 49kg and Karen calls Lisa over and tells the world that I've basically lost a whole Lisa because she's exactly 50kg and has been exactly 50kg her whole life. She also told me I mustn't lose any more because I'm skinny now (nope, still got 30kg to go and I'm close to the border between obese and overweight according to BMI). 

Lisa congratulates me, makes her escape and goes off to wrangle the children trying to catch fireflies while Karen latches on like a leech. Asking me how I did it (lchf); telling me that she loves bread, pasta and potatoes too much to do that (teehee) and then moves on to how she doesn't understand why she's fat and Lisa isn't. She was at Lisa's wedding over twenty years ago and they were both 50kg. Lisa's stayed at 50kg and gotten back to that weight after having children. Karen on the other hand... hasn't. She can't understand why since she and Lisa eat the same things and in fact most of the time she eats even less!

This piqued my interest because I love reading here and in r/fatlogic so I started to watch them.

One of the other guests passed around a platter of homemade samoosas. Lisa took one and passed the platter along, Karen ate two and picked up a third before passing the platter to the next person.

I went over to the cheese and took a little to have with my biltong. Lisa made up two crackers with some cream cheese and walked away from the table. Karen stationed herself by the table, ate a whole sleeve of crackers with cheese and opened another sleeve before she left.

This was the pattern for the whole evening while Karen lamented that she couldn't understand why Lisa hadn't gained weight and she had. I made a comment that Lisa seemed to pay more attention to portion sizes but that was rejected as not relevant because Karen had ""hardly eaten anything all day so I've got to make up for it because if you don't eat enough then your body holds on to the fat and you gain even more"". She eventually decided it must be her genetics and that Lisa's just lucky. What about me? I'm lucky as well because obviously my genetics are suited to banting (which is what lchf is called here). 

Sigh.

Also, she made a point of offering me a piece of everything high in carbs on that table. Each time I refused, she would tell me I was being so good and she'd never be able to resist temptation like that. Why do people like her do this!? ",Hammy New Year
fatpeoplestories,"I traveled 375 miles to visit my hamily and endured the usual over-indulgence of every kind that comes with holiday celebrations.  Luckily, the usual skinny shaming of me was mild.  I was criticized for only having 3000 calories to their 10,000 calories every day for a week. Thanks for being mild to me for once.

The last part of the week, I was in a hotel with my sister for 2 nights.  I was cringingly aware of her attention to my food consumption.  At the hotel, she admitted she tried to eat like me and she just couldn't.  She said I had a much higher metabolism than her and that if she did not eat enough - especially if she didn't have a solid plan for the next meal - she felt anxiety and was worried she would faint.  She HAS to eat so much.

The fatlogic is obvious, but we were having a really nice time, so I just said, ""OK.""

She asked, ""What?""

I said, ""Let's just ....not talk about this.  We're having fun and let's not talk about food and exercise."" or something to that effect.

She frowned at me and said, ""WHAT?!""

I said, "" Look, stomachs are similar to an elastic bag.  Yours may be stretched out and you always feel hungry.  I rarely over eat.  Maybe cut back on your portions a little more a little at a time.""  She is obsessed with not turning out obese like my mother.  No one would consider her fat, but she is on the upside of chunky.  

She replied with annoyance bordering on anger and I again insisted we just drop it.  No one wants to hear the way they were raised and the loved ones they surround themselves with are the root of their problem.

I mean, I brought a bag of cookies to the hotel.  I ate one.  When I packed up to leave, the bag was nearly empty.  My sister eats way too much!

Anyway, that last day, I got my dna test results via email.  You know, those kits they sell for finding out your ancestry.  I opted for the health-test, as well.  My results were pretty much everything I already knew, but the health part was interesting.

It said that based on my ancestry and my height, it could be considered average if I was 50 pounds over weight.  (yep, my family is easily 50 pounds heavier than they should be.)

HOWEVER, it is written several times that genetics don't play a main role in average weight.  That culture and where you live, your personal routine play a far bigger role in the weight that you are.

I read that to my sister.

She said, ""See!  You ARE an anomaly!""

fatpeoplestories,"Hey, since I started reading a lot of FPS I thought I might enter one of my own. There could be more to come since I already have lots of stories about the person I am referring to. Please excuse any mistakes I made in the following text, English is not my first language. 

All of this happened a while ago. Might have been around end of 2016/early 2017. But for some backstory: Quite some time ago and even before that time I started working in a museum on the weekends to earn some extra money. I am basically a security guard and watch over people not to touch paintings and show them their way around, things like that. It really isn't hard and there is not a lot to do because the museum is not very frequented, so most of the time you can actually read for 2 hours or even longer and drink a coffee, something I would actually seldom find time for to do at home because I will always find something to do that needs to be done.

So I already worked there for a few years and always liked going there - although you always get the odd person one does not like to work with that usually gets fired quickly or doesn't like the job and resigns - when we hired the wife of a co-worker. I didn't know her and my boss, to whom I have a pretty good connection, asked me if I would think it is a good idea to hire her. I told her no, because all this hiring of family members and SOs was getting too much in my opinion. Not that it was a problem yet, but I anticipated some down the line.

Nevertheless, they did not have a lot of people to choose from and actually hired here anyway. When I saw her walk in the first time I immediately realized that hiring her was a big mistake. 

She is heavy. I am not that good at guessing weight, but at least 240 lbs at probably around 5""3. Not only her upper, but also her lower legs are touching each other, making it hard for her to walk or even stand. She seriously looks like a globe. She waddles in and is already out of breath and sweating, demanding a chair. She walked from the parking lot to the building. This is not a long distance. 

There might not be a lot to do in this job most of the time, but there are times when the museum is packed to the brim (usually at special occasions like the day where there are actors performing and when admission is free). If you happen to work at one of those days you will have to stand and walk for 8-10 hours straight, barely getting a break at all, while being friendly to a clientele that usually does not frequent museums - to put it nicely. But that might be another story if anyone is interested.

So she walked in and immediately acted like she is my superior and can boss me around, demanding for a chair. I pointed her to the next one where she sat down and from where she introduced herself. Great start. 
She had an attitude that I did not like at all (I have grown to hate her at this point and over time). Mouthing off about other colleagues of mine, demanding this, demanding that, ignoring almost everything I tell her in a good spirit, not doing the things I tell her to do, etc. I was raised to be polite so I think she might overcompensate for being nervous and give her the benefit of the doubt. 
I thought wrong. Her attitude is like that all the time. She is very confrontational, especially regarding her weight. Always demanding. Always gossiping. Always eating. Always feeling treated unfairly. 

We are not allowed to eat in the museum itself - as are the visitors. She doesn't care. 
On her first day she ate 4 pieces of cake after I told her she should probably go upstairs to the little employee-room and eat there to stay out of trouble. She told me that: ""Well, no superior is here to see me, so I don't care"", with a smug smile on her face and an obviously faked laughing noise. Superiors do come in unannounced, though. I told her, she still doesn't care. 

On my second day with her she brings a second breakfast and a generous lunch. 
When the occasional guest comes in, you stand up, greet them in a friendly manner and after the person at the counter sold them their tickets, you show them the way and different sections of the museum. She just hides her food under her chair and does not get up at all. She does not even greet the visitors - how could she when her mouth is full of food? And to top it off: She didn't even ask me if I wanted some of her food - not that I would have accepted anything. 
At this point I worked with her for two days and she already destroyed the peace I usually had there. I had to do everything she won't do because she is too lazy. 

I usually only work on weekends, so when I come back the next week I hear stories about what she did next. Things escalated quickly. The four pieces of cake where just an entrée if you might say so. 
Behind the counter is a fairly big window sill, where usually some stuff lies around in an orderly manner - posters etc. It can be seen by guests, though the counter prohibits access to it. You have to go around through a door, so the area behind the counter is a little cut off from the entrance hall. 
My colleagues tell me that she used that window sill to actually create a buffet. For herself. She never offered anything to anyone at all. She even moved her chair there, so she would not be as exposed as in the entrance hall. 
It had cake, a salad solely consisting of mayonnaise, two kinds of meat in two big heaps, lots of bread, cookies and other sweets.
I don't know how she got it there in the short time frame she had. She installed it in the 15 minutes her colleague had gone to disarm the alarm system, open the doors and get everything ready, because she can't do it at this point (she still can't do it to this day). The janitor saw her buffet about 30 minutes after my colleague came back (who does not give any shit at all and ignored it) and immediately flipped his shit. He is kind of choleric so they both ended up screaming at each other about her stupid buffet.

She complained to supervisors about him discriminating against her, leaving out the part with her installation of a brunch table. 
They didn't care. They just want their peace. So nothing happened. She even did the buffet-thing a few times more just to fuck with the janitor and her colleagues, but eventually stopped it.

The worst part in this is that her shenanigans have no consequences for her. None at all. And this is by far not the worst stunt she has pulled.

While one always has some shitty colleagues, she kind of was the very heavy straw that broke the camel's back in a way. It kind of made me grow up. Some people just do not care. They are insecure and mask it with being confrontational to a point that is not imaginable while being so oblivious to their surroundings that I seriously doubt their mental health. Farther down the road her behavior had negative consequences for all of her colleagues and she still did not care at all or changed. 

Sorry if this is too long or not very well structured, I just happen to work with her right now and I am fuming already, so I had to let off some steam.

fatpeoplestories,"Hello FPS! Sending you Christmas tidings from the Land of the Free and the Home of the Bredd.

Judge Bredd, that is.

AKA [my lazy fatass father who failed his gastric bypass](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/a96jw4/shit_your_dad_says_when_youre_on_a_lowcarb_diet/) He’s decided I’m a traitor to the family because I went low-carb and refused to break it for the holidays.

For the past few days, I’ve been acting as court stenographer. Keeping a list of fatlogicky events for your reading pleasure. It’s been a horrible time for me. Hopefully you guys will have a good time indulging in these excerpts.

Also residing in Judge Bredd’s courtroom are:

* Bailiff: my mom. 5’4” 230 lbs. Has lost 50 lbs in two years by exercising and cutting out all sugar and sweetener. Goes hog wild during the holidays, though.
* My Sister, 5’4” 180 lbs, and her Boyfriend,5’10” normal weight.
* Me, mannfan9292, 5’2” 175 lbs

**Christmas Day, 7:45 am**

Airplane touches down. Judge Bredd picks me up from airport. He looks the same weight. Every time he attempts conversation about food, I change the subject.

Thankfully by the end of the ride we’re having a good time talking about memes. God bless memes.

**9:15 am**

Home from the airport. Bailiff has made her traditional Christmas Day \~\~peepholes\~\~ perogies for breakfast. I smile and say nothing. She invites me to take some. I remind her that I’m low-carb. 

&gt;Bailiff: “Oh. Still?”

**6:30 pm**

Dinner at my aunt’s house. Dessert is here and I decline one of the pies.

&gt;Bailiff: “What is wrong with you?”

A hard stare makes her back down.

**Boxing Day, 7:15 am**

Bailiff presents cinnamon strata and bagels for breakfast.

Sigh.

I eat lox and cream cheese on lettuce leaves.

**9:30 am**

Judge Bredd gets out of breath putting together a puzzle.

\***10:49 am**

Judge Bredd is thirsty and wants hot chocolate.

 Judge Bredd calls me into the kitchen. He needs me to help by TASTING the hot chocolate. 

&gt;“I can’t eat that, Dad.”  
&gt;  
&gt;You can’t? But it’s milk.”  
&gt;  
&gt;MFW ingredients on the counter include melted chocolate bars, sugar, heavy cream.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sister replaces me as court taster.  
&gt;  
&gt;she later tells me it was the worst hot chocolate she’d ever had.

**5:30 pm**

Judge Bredd sentences us to Irish stew, featuring not a green vegetable in sight. 

He has three bowlfuls and drinks a bottle of wine. No one else is drinking wine.

**Dec 27th 8:30 am**

Judge Bredd sentences us to scones for breakfast.

Bailiff says I’m not allowed to eat three boiled eggs for breakfast because that would “waste too many eggs”. 

As a compromise I am sentenced to preparing Gordon Ramsey-style scrambled eggs for the family. For those who don’t know, they’re scrambled eggs with generous amounts of butter and a splash of heavy cream.

When it’s time to add the heavy cream, Judge Bredd snatches the carton from my hands and pours half its contents into the eggs. There is so much cream that the final cooked eggs look white.

**10:00 am**

Mom suggests going out to hike a local trail. Judge Bredd says we can’t do that because he can’t fit everyone into his car. He has my mom’s car towed to his mechanic to fix her brake lines, and we spent the rest of the day playing board games and watching TV.

**3:00 pm**

Judge Bredd sentences us to pasta fagiole for lunch. I smile and say nothing. When lunch is served, I’m late to the table because I had to microwave a chicken thigh and braised cabbage/onions. It was two weeks old, but there was no other protein in the house. 

Judge shoots daggers at me when I sit down.

**3:45 pm**

Judge Bredd approaches me before he leaves for the grocery store.

&gt;”Sorry you couldn’t eat lunch, but it was more important to make something *everyone* could enjoy.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I forgot you can’t eat anything but protein. On the way home I’ll hit some roadkill and you can eat that.”

I channel my rage into an intense burpee /kettlebell workout in my backyard while tears stream down my face.

**5:30 pm**

Sister and Boyfriend return from shopping trip with Judge Bredd. Sister procured a spaghetti squash so I can eat the dinner the Judge sentenced. (shrimp scampi). Yaaas

**7:30 pm**

Bailiff has fallen asleep on the couch. The rest of us are tired and lazy. Instead of shrimp scampi we all just grab our own thing.

Judge Bredd gets blasted on four gin &amp; tonics. He acts hurt that his dinner sentence isn’t being served. When his wife is asleep... And everyone else is tired...

He follows me into the kitchen so he can make comments at me while I prepare my own dinner (a salad). I storm off and hide in the bathroom until he leaves the kitchen and passes out in a chair in the living room.

**7:50 pm**

I eat my salad in peace and wish I had a new family.",The Christmas Trials of Judge Bredd
fatpeoplestories,"My family have a long history of diabetes and heart disease. I can only describe my family’s diet as “southern/white trash” because idk what else to call it. 🤷🏻‍♀️ We ate some traditional southern dishes, lots of fried foods, etc. We also ate a lot of bland, carb-loaded, cheese-smothered Tex Mex. But when we weren’t eating those things, we ate as though we were on a road trip and could only buy food from gas stations. So, packs of powdered donuts, twinkies, fried pies. Chips and pork rinds and slim jims. Microwave nachos and hot dogs. On and on. All we ate was junk food.

But the worst thing was the soda. I remember going to Walmart every week and stocking up. We got two liter bottles, not cans, because it was cheaper that way. So once a week I’d go with my mom to get soda and we’d fill the little spot for babies to sit in at the front of the basket with two liter bottles of soda. Not just any soda, but Mountain Dew. My brother and dad lived off of it, and I drank it with dinner growing up. As a family we had 20 liters of Mountain Dew per week. 

This was normal for us, a family with a history of diabetes and heart disease. This was normal for me and my brother to consume as children. I never thought anything of it, until I grew up and realized that was possibly the dumbest thing you could feed your children.

**Edited to add**: I forgot to mention that I had kidney issues growing up too, where I would get infections, get dehydrated, and have bladder control problems often. I'm not saying they were caused by the soda, but imagine giving your child soda every day when they've been hospitalized multiple times for kidney infections and dehydration due to kidney problems. This seemed totally normal to me when I was a kid but now I'm horrified because it's borderline abuse and negligence.","Funny the things that seemed normal as a child, leave me speechless now"
fatpeoplestories,"It's been a while since I posted anything and thankfully, Dragonfruit hasn't been able to do any more lasting damage. Not that she didn't try... BeetusBot will probably do its job linking my past stories in the comments.

This is a comparatively short tale and might not be as jimmy-rustling as the others I've written, but I think it still needs to be told.

Cast:

Kinvara (me), 26 F, successfully lost a whole 90 lbs since October 2017. I now weigh 127 lbs at 5'6.

HotGuy, 29, 6'0, approximately 175-180 lbs of broad shoulders, trim waist and veiny-muscled arms. Referred to in the previous story and now my boyfriend! :D :D

Peanut, 27 F, friend whose marriage this incident took place at. Approximately 140 lbs at 5'4. Her stats are relevant.

JellyAuntie, mid 40s-early 50s, maybe 5'3 and 200 lbs.


Onto the story!

Now I don't know if it is the same in weddings of the western world, but Indian weddings are replete with these three Fs: Food, Festivity, and Family. Lots and lots of family members. Relatives of a neighbour of a relative. Things like that. The most infamous of this lot, however, are the judgemental aunties: middle-aged women who make it their business to judge everyone else's appearance/outfit/profession/lifestyle choices/significant others, what have you.

Anyway, JellyAuntie is Peanut's distant relative. She has a son, Marmalade, who she once tried to set me up with. I was not interested. Guy was a tool. 

I arrived at the wedding with HotGuy as my plus one. We were a group of nearly 20 friends, catching up, eating the delicious food, and generally having a nice time.

Until JellyAuntie and her obnoxious coterie came up to us. We had met her several times before since Peanut is a close friend since many years. Her friends are mostly irrelevant to the story so I won't bother with descriptions.

JellyAuntie proceeded to ask some of my (male) friends questions about their careers, showed very genuine interest, lavished praise upon almost every one of them. Then she turned to the girls. No questions about their careers. She attacked all the unmarried ones with syrupy-sweet voiced questions like ""ohhhh your parents are not even LOOKING yet?"" or ""ooh hahaha but you were with XXX. What happened, did he leave you for someone else?"" and ""hurry up, hurry up. Time is running out. Come, I'll introduce you to my son Marmalade"" before shooting a sideways glance at me. All this time I was lurking a little away from the group because I mostly just wanted to avoid her.

Then, as was inevitable, she sidled up to me and greeted me with a LOTTTT of fake enthusiasm. Indians reading this sub would know what I mean (beta kaisi hoooo? Itne dino baad dekha, kitna accha laga, kitni sundar lag rahi ho, etc etc)

Important to note: At this point, HotGuy had stepped out for a while to take a call and had told me he planned to refill his plate after that, so he wasn't with me.

Then JellyAuntie very predictably shoots the ""Ohhh, not married yet? But WHY?"" and before I could answer, she continued with ""Yes, the arranged marriage scene is very disheartening nowadays. Such disappointing boys. My Marmalade though gets approached by 15-20 women every single day (on a matrimony app). You must be using the app too? I am sure you do, hahahaha. Not that you're seeing someone anyway""

Yet again I tried to interject when she chose to add this: ""As it is, you were so chubby till last year. Even though you have lost weight now, I can assure you that you will pile on the pounds real quick again. Look at your plate. You're eating halwa? How CAN you?""

Note, dear FPS readers, that she had her plate piled high with an assortment of at least 7-8 carb-rich/fatty foods and had not even begun with dessert. The only dessert I chose to have was the halwa, because I friggin' love that, and did not partake of the 6-7 other options at all.

I tried to explain but she continued: ""How will you get someone if you eat like this? My Marmalade liked you even when you were fat. Now look where things have ended up. You're still alone and he has all these women behind him...""

Just then HotGuy joined me with a plateful of desserts. The guy is a fitness fanatic normally, but he sure has a sweet tooth. He was totally unaware of all that transpired between me and JellyAuntie thus far and proceeded to feed me a bit of rasmalai off a spoon. Just a cutesy thing. I ate that and looked right at JellyAuntie right in the eye while doing so.

She clammed right up after that and found an excuse to walk away very soon, but FPS, her expression of utter shock and humiliation defies description!

fatpeoplestories,"I just arrived home from WDW and it wasn’t a happy trip.

When I went to Disney’s MGM (Hollywood) Studios on my first day at the park, I decided to get a photo opportunity with Goofy as Santa Claus. While I was waiting in line, an morbidly obese (300lbs+) family of four cut right in front of me in line. One of them was a teenage or young adult female and she had run over my foot without paying any attention to her surroundings. I told her that she had run over my foot and that they had cut in front of me in line, but they didn’t say or do anything but not care at all.

Plus when they were next to take the photos, ALL of them got off their jazzies and walked perfectly fine to get next to Goofy for the photo.

It’s obsurd that Disney doesn’t do a medical check for all ECV users at their parks, cause I can assure you, that anywhere from 60-75% of those who use jazzies can walk perfectly fine and they make those who really need those to get around look bad.

Now I am not skinny myself, I am a male, 6’3”, and I weigh 235 pounds. I walked through-out my trip to WDW, and I frequently park-hopped to get around.

I walked around 8-12 miles per day on my trip.

I had previously been a four month diet and lost 40 pounds during that time, and I continue my diet and daily excerise to get to 200-190 pounds in another four months.

Later in my trip, I was cut off by more obese people in jazzies, and while I was waiting for a bus to my resort hotel for around a hour, another obese family on jazzies got to get onboard the bus first and I watched as elderly folks in wheelchairs and ECV’s were unable to get on the bus because the obese people got there first.

fatpeoplestories,"My dad used to be my weight-loss hero. He lost over 150 lbs after his gastric bypass in 2009. He kept the weight off until about five years ago, when he started putting on a couple lbs a year due to inactivity. When I last saw him in August, he’d put on 50 lbs from his lowest weight and was not happy about that. I hoped that by the time I visited for Thanksgiving he’d have lost the weight. Sadly, that wasn’t the case for the man who will henceforth be known NOT as my dad, but as Judge Bredd.

**NOVEMBER 2018**

Judge Bredd picked my boyfriend and I up from the airport. Upon entering the car, I was shocked and heartbroken to see he’d gained another 50 lbs. He was wearing his old fat clothes that I haven’t seen in years. I spent the entire car ride silent and clenching my boyfriend’s hand in a death grip to avoid crying.

We drive two hours home to drop off our bags, and then we immediately hopped back in the car and spent another three hours driving around to all the different grocery stores in the area. Grocery shopping is Judge Bredd’s only hobby and form of exercise. In three hours he blows $300 on food and another $200 on liquor. He nearly had a meltdown because a store was out of his brand of coffee. (Will detail his grocery store meltdowns in another story.)

As soon as Judge Bredd pulls the car into out driveway, he suggests we drive another 40 minutes to a local deli for lunch. I snap and tell him no, boyfriend and I are tired of being in the car and would like to eat a small lunch at the house. Judge Bredd sighs like he’s dealing with a small child:

&gt; “Honey, there’s nothing to eat in the house.” 

&gt; *(After we just spent $300 on groceries...)*

JB relents and lists the options of quick meals he can make us: hash browns, pasta, grilled cheese, homemade pizza... So much for “nothing to eat in the house”.

I tell JB not to worry, I’ll make something else because I’m eating low carb. He narrows his eyes.

&gt; “Well, what exactly do you plan on eating? In this house, we eat bread.” 

I happily informed him that I can eat all protein, dairy, and all produce. I can even eat beans! But Judge Bredd wasn’t happy with this sentence. His  face went red and his eyes narrowed further as he muttered,

&gt; “You can’t make anything taste good without bread.”

I ignored him and start making a salad using some (untouched) vegetables from the fridge. Judge Bredd improved my lunch by pulling out two wedges of Brie, slicing up two baguettes and shoving the platter into my workspace.

The mood lightened a bit once my mom and sister were home. (They complimented my weight-loss while Judge Bredd glowered in the corner.) 

But FPS, the whole freakin’ week was a nightmare. Every social activity was centered around food or the TV. There was bread and expensive cheese at every meal, and between meals. After our grocery spree, he spent an additional $100 on fancy cheeses throughout the course of the week. Plus, Judge Bredd had a never-ending stream of remarks about what I eat. 

&gt; “I’m having polenta for breakfast, but YOU can’t eat THAT so YOU’ll just have to find something else.”

&gt; “I bought this beautiful Brioche from [fancy French bakery] for French toast, and now we’ll have to wait to eat it until after YOU leave! Who knows if it’ll even be good by then!”

&gt; “Why would you go through the trouble of making a cauliflower crust when a real crust doesn’t even have that many carbs in it? Pie crust is mostly butter.”

&gt; “Guess we can’t go out for [local donut chain] while you’re here, either.”

I’d never been happier to leave home as I was the Saturday my flight departed. If it weren’t for my supportive and health-conscious boyfriend, I wouldn’t have gotten through the trip alive.

fatpeoplestories,"Im a 5 foot 6 inches male who was 16 stone 4 pounds 2 months ago and have now reached 14 stone and 4 pounds through dieting/exercising. (Still nowhere near where i want to be).

But yesterday i attended a relatives wedding and while I was sitting at a table with my family, my aunt (dont know her very well only met her for the first in my life that day because we arent very close with my father's family) sat next to me on my right hand side. My mom and her began chatting and got into talking about planning a family gathering event/party for new years day. They began talking about what food to have and my aunt suggested pizza. My mom told her that i dont eat pizza (i really dont like pizza sorry pizza lovers). So my aunt suggested take-out eg. Burgers and fries etc... which my mom answered i dont like that either due to my new healthier lifestyle. Then out of nowhere she went up to me (i was on my phone throughout the conversation btw so i had no idea and TBH i wasnt planning on wanting anything because i dont want to mess up my weightloss progress by cheating on my diet), and she said ""you dont like eating junk food so why are you so fat?""

I paused with pure shock for about 5-10 seconds I mean I am fat and I know I am but I am making a difference and trying to get rid of it (which she was aware of because my parents began telling everyone at the wedding about my weightloss because my parents love showing off their kids achievements like most parents do with their family - which I never asked them to) so I found it so rude how she just threw that out there knowing this. Its like asking why a person in weelchair cant walk without one.

 I dont understand how she couldnt have just assumed that there were other reasons why i could possibly be overweight such as other junk food (besides the chip shop) or the fact that I never exercised for a long time prior to losing the weight or was very uneducated at the time about eating a balanced diet. 

IDK i just think she could have not bothered to include the word ""fat"" and just asked ""what I like to eat?"" instead. But I guess I'm glad she said that because I will not be attending her event anyways and will instead be spending my new years at the gym.",I was fat shamed by my aunt at a wedding

fatpeoplestories,"This is sort of your run-of-the-mill fat, lazy person story, but it's the holidays so I thought I'd throw in a holiday bonus edition to those who find Carnie an interesting train-wreck.  


In our community every year in December, there is a ""Giving Back to the Community"" program in town where anyone who wants to (not just those in need) can show up for a free, festive meal while local choirs and bands sing and perform. It's kind of fun and we always go, run into people we know, sit around and laugh and chat and eat and be merry. 

  
Knowing how Carnie and her husband were always financially struggling and their favorite past time is eating, I thought for sure they would appreciate it more than anyone, since the alternative is spending $10 or more per person on fast food for dinner. Yeah, I know, how silly of me to think that.  


The group that puts it on has a lot of volunteers and have their system down to a science, getting people seated and served and cleaned up after very quickly. In my experience, having gone several times over the years, people are coming and going throughout the evening, so there are always seats and parking spots opening up. You may wait a *few* minutes to be seated, but as soon as you sit down, someone rushes up and brings you a plate and dessert (everyone gets the same ""christmas dinner"" plate) and offers you something to drink – if you only want to eat and get out, it's still faster than most restaurants, since you don't have to order, you don't have to pay, and you don't have to wait for them to put your order together. And if you're still hungry and want a second plate, they'll give you one.  


Because of the jobs she worked she often had a non-traditional work schedule, so the first year or two I told her about it, she had to work and couldn't make it. But the next time I found out she and Harry both had that night off, so I broke House Rule #1 and invited her.  I said, ""Go to the Community Center, get your free meal! We'll probably go after work, so maybe about 6:30 or 7pm. Maybe we'll see you there!"" 

  
She had some reservations about it.   

  
*Carnie: Well, what kinds of food are they serving? I only like certain things!*  
**Me:** What's not to like? It's probably turkey or ham and mashed potatoes, dressing and cranberry sauce. Don't worry; it's stuff you like!  
*Carnie: What do they have to drink? Because I don't like wine. It makes me sick.*  
**Me:** (laughing) No, they are not giving away free alcohol! That would lead to problems! Haha!  
*Carnie: But like, what DO they give you to drink? I don't like water. It's boring. I don't drink iced tea, either!*  
**Me:** They'll have soda. Probably generic brand, but at least it's soda.  
*Carnie: Oh, okay. I don't mind the generic sodas. That's what I usually buy!*  


Good! So it sounds like she's going. I said I'll probably see her there (it was made it clear I wasn't picking her up!). I had to give her directions to where it was, since she hardly ever crosses to this side of the railroad tracks and doesn't seem to know where anything is.  
   
I didn't hear from her all that day, but when I got to the community center I texted her to see if she was there so I could find her in the crowd.  
 

*Carnie: No. We drove down there but it was a waste of gas!*   
**Me:** What? Why?  
*Carnie: Well, we got there and there were no parking spots and then we saw there was a line of people and you* ***know*** *we can't wait in line. We have (whatever health conditions)! So we left.*  
**Me:** What? Are you sure you went to the COMMUNITY center? Were you maybe at the wrong place? There is plenty of parking, it goes around to the left and behind the building. We just got here and we didn't have any trouble finding a spot. We didn't have to wait in any line. They seated us almost immediately and our food is already here.

*Carnie: Well, it was long when we were there!*   
 **Me:** What time did you go?  
*Carnie: You said it started at 5 so that's when we went!*  
   
In her defense, I suppose if you showed up right when the doors were supposed to open there might have been a line, so she might not have been lying about the ""long line"" at that time. But since all the tables were empty at the beginning, I can't imagine it took long to get seated once the doors opened!   
   
**Me:** I suppose it was busy then, but why didn't you wait? I told you we'd go after 6. We could have met you!

*Carnie: We had to go early because we were hungry!! I mean, I guess we did see a few parking spaces but they were far from the building and we didn't want to have to walk that far. Besides, I told you we were HUNGRY and didn't have time to wait.*    


Yes, Carnie, I'm sure you would have starved to death if you didn't eat right at 5pm. (eyeroll)  This wasn't about either of them having to get to work or other activity and that's why they were in such a rush and had to go early, they just have no impulse control and constantly need instant gratification.

  
Predictably, they left and went straight to whatever the nearest fast food chain was and spent whatever money was in their pocket for dinner and weren't even going to consider coming back for some free food. Not because they couldn't eat any more (ha!) but because they were mad now and didn't want to waste the gas.

  
This was the sort of thing that would always drive me crazy about her. *""Oh we're so broke, we don't have money for anything!""* Yet then you'd say, ""Here's a free meal"" and she'd turn into a choosy-beggar. Well, only if it's certain foods and only if I can park right next to the handicapped parking, and only if I don't have to stand in a line and I get served first, before anyone else, because I'm HUNGRIER than they are.  

Ug!  
 

Mostly, this left me wondering – if she was starving and having to eat her dinners at 5pm, what was she doing at 9pm? Going out for a second dinner because she was hungry again? ",Cousin Carnie [Part 6]: Choosy Beggar Edition
fatpeoplestories,"I work as a TA at the school I’m doing my graduate degree at. Anyway we had our faculty party yesterday afternoon. It was very nice they catered out and had a bunch of good food, deserts, drinks etc. My SO used to work at the university before she enlisted in the marines. So she has tons of friends on staff. The party is after the student center closes which is around 4 and its faculty only but a lot of spouses come. I asked my boss if it was ok to bring my SO and he said “she better come.” 
There’s two bitchy ham planets we will call Karen and Janet. They have nothing nice to say, ever, do not ask them how they are doing unless you have hours 

So my SO drove from work to the party so she was in uniform.  Immediately I hear Karen bitch about how there might not be enough food with everyone bringing their spouses. Then Janet chimes in with how we aren’t even married, never mind we’ve been together since age 14. 
My SO just grinned big at them and said hi. My SO and I just had one plate each and just little bites since we had her work party later in the night. 
So my boss got all of us boxes of chocolate and when anyone would go up for food, Janet and Karen would swoop in and steal their box. 
Of course they got ours, I went over and asked them back for ours and they looked put out. “You walked away from them, why do you care?” Karen whined 
“Because Karen maybe I wanted them! “ she handed them over but gave us dirty looks till we left ",Maybe I wanted those Karen
fatpeoplestories,"I’m currently 360 pounds and 6’1. Being tall my fat distributes pretty well, but I’m not trying to justify my fat as I am still a ham and I’m trying to work on my weight.

Now I always thought I ate bad as my worst ever moment was me going to jack in the box and ordering 8 burgers a large curly fries and two large sodas. Five burgers in I realized what I was doing and almost threw up from my own disgust and swore to never do that again. Just a little confession so you guys can give me a bit of feedback 

The actual story I was at a Starbucks using my laptop to search for a new job. I don’t drink coffee or buy anything from there it’s just the WiFi is free and convenient.

So around 10:30 I saw a huge wide man on one of those sitting scooters trying to get into the shop. He pushes the door open with the scooter and wouldn’t budge since the walk up to the door was a ramp so some sort of momentum would be needed to push the door with the scooter. It wouldn’t budge so since I was pretty close I decided to open both doors just to be nice. He gives me a look that wasn’t thankful but more like mad or disgusted because he couldn’t do it himself. I didn’t see what he ordered and really didn’t bother with what he wanted so I went back on my laptop. 

After 10 minutes or so I saw him go full speed at the door through one opening and got stuck. Now when I say he was stuck I mean the other door seemed to get stuck between his side fat and wouldn’t move. The door was wedged in well and wouldn’t budge. I was about to get up and help but part of me wanted to see him get out on his own. As I mentioned earlier I’m a ham myself and I hate when I need help because of my size. I prefer to do it myself even if it puts me in pain or I suffer a lot. I refuse to let my size cripple me.

So from the sideline I was chanting in my head for him to get through and leave. About two minutes of struggling he was able to get out and I was proud of him doing it on his own. I know to him it’s probably a daily struggle but that should be a small victory. It might not change his path in life but I hope to think so.

Now maybe you guys think I’m a bad guy for not helping but keep in mind I was at a Starbucks at 10:30 so the place was packed and anybody could have got up to help him. I just refused to help him because he can do it himself no matter the struggle. No matter how much it hurts you can do and the outcome is great no matter how big the task is.

Edit: I’m literally laughing my ass off at the Starbucks right now and people keep looking at me😂. I also love how the whole story was overlooked because of one line🙏🏽👍🏽",Saw a guy at Starbucks stuck at the door
fatpeoplestories,"So this past week at Domino's a new girl joined the insider staff. She was 19, biracial and chubby, and while pregnant you can tell she is still chunky without the baby belly. Considering how busy it can get and being understaffed sometimes it's good to have some more help. However, as you will see I(and I bet my coworkers) have come to regret this girls prescence. From this point on, she will be called Dickseeker. I do not call her this at work or say it to anyone, I only use this on this post for anonymity and because it is...unfortunately quite accurate.


First sign that something is amiss with this chick is that she apparently had moved from another state but said she had worked at Domino's for 3 months already. Only problem, she did not act like someone who already had experience at Domino's. She asked a bunch of questions about the most basic stuff(topping cheese, etc) which she should have gotten down if her experience was genuine. She even did things like put PIZZA labels on PASTA boxes.


I didn't think much at first about it, but then when I was manning the oven, DS got in the way(despite me being assigned there) trying to box a pizza for a lady who had been waiting for awhile. She had ordered a sausage, mushroom and olive pizza and what came out was *pepperoni*, olives and mushroom. I was trying to check if this was for a different order or if it was made wrong so I could have it remade, but DS actually put that pizza in the sausage/mushroom/olive box but I managed to stop her. I had the make line crew put the right pizza in but the lady ended up waiting longer than if DS hadn't gotten in the way(the lady's husband also apparently couldn't eat pepperoni due to tenitis or something)


At this point, DS came off as kinda strange and a bit annoying but I chalked it up to pregnancy hormones and whatnot. But this is where I found out that she was indeed problematic. When she was about to leave her shift, she was getting this custom cheesy bread monstrosity she made for herself out(twice the size of a regular cheesy bread, slightly burned and stuffed with sausage, mushroom, spinach and a bunch of cheese). I made a remark about the size of that thing, and then she gave me that ''certain'' look and said ''I like em big.'' Keep in mind, I'm a black guy and there's *that* *certain* *stereotype* so yeah. And it gets worse because most of my male coworkers told me how she also made blatant and inappropriate passes at them:


-The manager on duty at the time was on the phone with a customer and DS tried to flirt with him. He didn't give her much attention and she got upset.


-One of our drivers was approached by her with her asking him if he was married, which he was(wears his wedding wring in plain site). She is again upset.


-Then, one of the other drivers tells me as I'm helping him load orders into his car that she even made a pass at him and then some. He tried making friendly conversation with her, and apparently out of fucking nowhere she talks about how her sister had an abortion(completely not at all related to their discussion) and described in detail about the blood and parts. To top it all off, he overheard him going through her ''side niggas'' on the phone.


All in all, I am concerned about working with this chick. While I try not to be judgmental, how the hell can the bitch be so far along in her pregnancy but still trying to get it on with a bunch of random guys, even at the job which she needs? It's disgusting, and frankly let whatever high power(s) exist have mercy on that poor baby.

fatpeoplestories,"so i was flying yesterday, an low cost flight of 4:30 hours.      
sadly i got the middle seat... i dont really mind, but in that time i obviously would prefer an aisle seat.                
so first a young girl sat in the aisle seat. she was nice and everything was good.      
then someone said that the window seat is his and he wants to enter. i raised my eyes and i shit you not... it was legit a 350~400lbs 5'7-5'8 men, **extremely** wide.       
i just couldnt understand how the fuck he allow himself to buy only 1 seat. i have no problem with fat people, its not my business but why do i need to suffer?     
anyway while im getting up so he can get in, im motivating myself in the head to not allow him to take  my space.    
and then he sat.... i kid you not, his belly slided to like 10-20% of my seat, his leg was like 50% (!) deep to my space and he ofcourse took the armest and 50% of his arm passed to my seat space because it was so big.      
i legit was like wtf. how does he thinks its normal?     
anyway i told him that he's invading my space, and he just said ""what do want me to do?"" which i replied with ""i dont know, but how about not taking 50% of my space and cuddling with me?"".    
then he unsuccessfully tried to squeeze himself, it was legit like 3-4cm better.     
i then sat to see how bad things are, and... it was really bad:       
his leg was squeezing my leg, his belly touched my hip (!), and his arm touched my ribs.       
all in a very hard way, like squeezing, not just little touch. it was like hugging someone.          
he legit took at least 30% of my space.      
i just stood up and told him its not gonna work, im not gonna feel uncomfortable the all flight and he's not gonna touch me like that.       
then this rude orca told me ""you are a small guy, im x3 your size just deal with it"".          
lol. i didnt know because im 5'6 and in regualr shape i should give him my space and i should let him touch me the all flight.    
at this point alot of people looked at us, and then one guy stood up, looked at how much space he takes and he said to him ""just because of your condition it doesnt mean you are entilted to his space. for long time i was extremely obese and i always bought 2 seats!"".          
then the full size orca told him to stfu and he putted on his shitty headphones, i could literally hear every word from his music.      
finally the flight attendant came and i explaind to her the sitaution. she told the orca he cant take my space like that.     
full size orca:       
""its not my fault. its your airline problems your seats are not big enough for big people.""       
her reply:     
""everyone know what are the sizes of flight seats. if you know you require 2 seats then you should buy 2 seats..""      
then the orca started saying that his weight is not our business so i told him YOUR RIGHT! ITS NOT MY BUSINESS THATS WHY I DONT NEED TO GIVE YOU HALF OF MY SEAT.      
after couple of minutes finally the orca was removed from my row, sadly they moved him to a row with 2 seats which he got for free, but at least my 20 minutes of horror was finsihed.    
he started gloating so hard when they gave him the 2 seats, you could just see in his face he does it everytime.     
fuck entitled people.     ",so an extremely fat person sat next to me in the plane..
fatpeoplestories,"Hey FPS,

Got a story for you that is happening now but started a few weeks ago. The tragic tale of the maiden CK and the Hamtaro beast. I will give you guys a warning, there is no justice for the maiden, or a happy ending in this story.

-----------
Maybe be: Me, call me MJ, 6’2 190lbs ( used to be at 175lbs until I got back from my cousin’s wedding in Hawaii and haven’t gotten back onto the workout routine but trying to ), works at a well known start up where all of this takes place. 


Maybe be: CK, office coordinator, super chill, 5'0 exactly, lean, mid 20's girl that’s responsible for stocking the free snacks and the coordinating the lunches we get catered daily. 


Don’t be: Hamtaro 5’8, around 330-350lbs from what I can tell but I’m pretty bad at guessing weight, but definitely see multiple folds over the belt and has a permanent plumbers crack showing, works in IT, new hire.

-----------
Just some backstory to give color to the situation I’m going to be describing. Lunch is catered sometime around 11:30 to 11:45 daily depending on delivery time and is served on 2 floors. Good to note that lunch is pre-ordered for the week and prepaid so changes are hard to make as they have to redo office expenses. Usually I will lag to the lunch spot on my floor since I have meetings and want to avoid the small lunch line, never runs out of food anyways. One day, come to the lunch line at 12:30, and almost all the food is gone except veggies and salad. Brushed it off as nothing weird but continues to happen the next day, and the next day, and only just veggies left. This usually never happens.

&amp;nbsp;

Joke to CK as she’s passing by where she’s keeping the rest of the food, gives me a death glare like I just slapped her mom. She tells me people are complaining the lunch is gone within 30 minutes because of one person. I tell her she’s shitting me, we have around 100 employees for both floors, no way we’re running out of food from one person as we always order for 120 employees. She tells me to come to lunch at 11:30 and see for myself.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is where the situation starts. Next day, I walk to the lunch area at 11:20 just to be a bit early and grab a water and shoot the shit if I see any of my friends in the kitchen area. First thing that hits me is the smell of wet socks and ass. Then I look to the corner and see Hamtaro, holding one of those large cookies that come in a 1 pack, nibbling it like a hamster, hence the name. Never seen him before, probably a new hire. He's just standing there in a corner and eating the cookie, looks like he's waiting for something.

&amp;nbsp;

11:25 comes around, I see CK rolling in the cart with the food and gives me the look. I look over to Hamtaro to see him getting giddy. He’s finished off his cookie but has crumbs in his beard and chocolate still on his fingers. He grabs a plate and stands directly behind CK as she is unloading the food and setting it out, which takes a few minutes. She’s visibly uncomfortable as his gut is touching her back as he leans over her shoulder to see what food is brought today. She's too shy and nice to say anything. I introduce myself to him in hopes he’ll move over closer to me but ignores me and just keeps looking at the food being unloaded, licking his lips and I thought I saw a happy tippy dance that dogs do when you take out a treat.

&amp;nbsp;

I shit you not, before even half of the food is laid out, he just grabs a serving spoon and goes to town on the trays that are open, grabbing gigantic heaps of orange chicken, and chow mein onto the extra large plates we usually get. It’s piled on and looks like Mt. Everest on that poor cardboard plate and walks away. I walk over to CK and say that was bad but I don’t see how we’re running out of food. All she says is “keep watching.” Much to my surprise, Hamtaro is back in 30 seconds holding another empty plate and goes back for another giant heaping of noodles, and this time has a gigantic scoop of beijing beef ( like a breaded deep fried beef dish with sugary sauce ). Walks away again with the heaping of food. No one else has yet even touched the food yet as CK is just about done unwrapping the veggies and the sauces.

&amp;nbsp;

Hamtaro does this 5 more times, each time with a big scoop of noodles or fried rice and some entree, except for the steamed veggies and veggie stir fry. I just stand there stunned as this is going on in the span of 7 minutes or so. Guys, the amount of food he has stacked onto the plate is enough for 3 people, it literally looks like family style quantity.

&amp;nbsp;

The next week CK had to order food for 140 people but as we continually add more people as we are hiring aggressively, it’s like a moving target for poor CK as she has to constantly guess how much food to order as any excessive amounts leftover looks poorly on her planning. That is the tragic story of CK and the beast known as Hamtaro. I'll update you guys with any updates on Hamtaro but for now, happy holidays!

fatpeoplestories,"So if you've been reading any of the comments I've teased here and there about the actual falling out I had with Hama. Given the fact that it didn't happen all at once and was instead a build up of many things i decided to do a quick summary of our senior. The actual falling out happened in college but it started in our senior year. 

I was 17, 5'3 max of 126 low of 106 over the year. I got an eating disorder and lost almost 20 pounds very quickly. The bones on my upper chest were clearly visible. My face got thinner. I got weaker. I was dealing with a lot of crap at home and many of my friends knew about this.

Hama was also 17, 5'8 and she had to be pushing 200 lbs. Obsessed with me and hates skinny people.

My senior year Hama went from gloomy 2/5 of the school week to 5/5. She couldn't or wouldn't carry conversations unless all the focus was on her. She would try to highjack conversations and when that failed she sulked. She was failing her classes. She took all this out on her boyfriend and me. All her texts to me were complaining about me or one of our other friends because they did something that offended her.

Our friend group grew, now comes in Ella. Ella is a short chubby badass girl with red hair and attitude. When Hama would make comments about my weight Ella would tell her to back off. When Hama made jokes about me ""secretly being a slut"" Ella would throw her own rumors back at her and say that she didn't like it when people did that. 

Ya see, Ella HATED Hama, because Ella was friends with Hama's boyfriend and knew how she treated him. Ella was also fond of me since we had a lot in common and I was Hama's in school target.

Now Ella couldn't stop Hama everywhere (schedules didn't line up) and I wasn't going to ""sic"" her on her. I just went with the flow and appreciated when I had the support.

No matter what Hama did though I always felt kind of bad for her. But the friend group started getting tired of how contradictory her stories were. A day wouldn't go by without complaining about her financial situation ""I don't know if I'll get dinner so I have to eat 2 lunchs"". The next day she'd come in and talk about what her dietitian told her she should be eating. Day after that she's talk about going to the movies or HOT YOGA. She'd talk about how much she hated her relationship one day then be fully in love the next.

I didn't want to be her friend but i didn't know how to do that. I just tried to ignore her. That led to a story I may have mentioned where she bit me so I hit her on reflex. Now that story is actually  REALLY REALLY important. And it happened just like it sounds. I wasn't paying attention to her so she bit me so I jumped away and swung. I bruised and she didn't.

She started lashing out. Yelling at me in the hallway and then apologizing later. She would call me terrible names or mock my appearance.  Her attitude and behavior made her insufferable. It was one constant pity party dotted with ""be jealous of me""s

One of these pity parties was to show us these bruises on her wrists, shaped like handprints. She told us her boyfriend was abusive and had hurt her last night when she wouldn't share her food. I talked to Ella about it and she showed me a picture of Hama's bruised up boyfriend. He had a black eye and bruises on his collar bones and face. 

The true story was she came upstairs and he was on the computer but she wanted to be. He was in the middle of a game and asked her to wait so she started whaling on him. The bruises on her wrists were from him trying to get her to stop hitting him. Her ""abuse"" was self defense. This was what really started turning people off. You could feel the switch. We were still friends. We still talked and texted. But there was something fundamentally different about the group after that. She didn't get invited out anywhere and no one wanted to be around her alone.

I would come to find that her attitude of being abusive then claiming victimhood wasn't unique to this situation 

",Hama the Jealous Whale: The declining friendship
fatpeoplestories,"Just a short one from me today. i promise to create some more elaborate posts than my previous ones and delve into the depraved cacophony that is M.

So last week, M went to a sleep clinic as he has trouble sleeping (sleep apnea i think). A colleague and long term friend of M pointed out that sleep apnea is more prevalent in obese individuals, and maybe losing a bit of weight would help. 

Suffice to say, these two colleagues of mine are no longer on speaking terms. I don't know what happened because unfortunately I wasn't there to witness it first hand. But i can only imagine how he reacted. something along the lines of 'WELL IT'S FUCKING EASY FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE GOOD GENETICS AND A DOG THAT YOU HAAAAVVVE TO WALK EVERY DAY SO YOU CAN'T REALLY GET FAT' or some other such bullshit. 

He has so much toxic logic, i'm certain i will be contributing more stories soon. ",Office Ham 4

APPETIZER:

All 6 of us are heading on a two day out-of-state tour of one of our suppliers. Lodging is arranged by our company; there is no hard and fast rule for meals but since we're only getting one car and there's nothing close to the hotel itself, we're locked into eating together (or at least in the same general area). Since we don't all live in the same part of town, we agree to meet up at work and leave our cars there overnight, rather than picking up someone/everyone en route.

KingOfTheSouth and I (coincidentally) live in the same apartment complex; he knows this, and asks me for a ride. Being spineless, I agree. On the drive over to work, he asks me how I've managed to lose weight since starting at the company.

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: What did you do to lose weight?

&amp;#x200B;

Me (caught off-guard by the question since I'm still fat): Nothing really, just portion control and try not to spend extra on food

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: What else are you doing, you have to be working out or something

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Nothing, really! That's all it is!

&amp;#x200B;

.... He obviously doesn't believe me, and the conversation ends. We get to work, find the company van, and pile into it. I'd be lying if I said the trip that day was exciting; after a long drive in which we all kept to ourselves, we got to the hotel, checked in, and regrouped after a half-hour or so to discuss dinner.

&amp;#x200B;

ENTREE:  **¿** Como se dice Diabetes?

""Where are we getting dinner?"" gets resolved quickly and diplomatically-there's a dozen or so restaurants all in the same set of buildings, on the river no less, and nothing else worth noting nearby.

&amp;#x200B;

It turns out there isn't a dedicated parking lot for the restaurants, so we find the nearest lot open to the public and park there. It's a short (\~3 blocks) walk to the restaurants and the sun's beginning to set over the river. It's a beautiful sight, the neighborhood we're in is also picturesque, and it just puts us in a good mood after a long day of driving. Well, *almost* all of us.

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: Why are we parking here?

&amp;#x200B;

Badger (obviously annoyed): Because we just spent 15 minutes looking for parking and everything else was full or a tow zone!

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: I thought we were getting dinner!

&amp;#x200B;

Badger: Yeah, we're going to walk over there right now and see what we want!

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: It's been such a long day, I'm just going to eat at the first place we find!

&amp;#x200B;

All of us (thinking to ourselves): Jesus *Christ*.

&amp;#x200B;

We make the 5 minute trek to the nearest restaurant, and it's a Mexican place.

&amp;#x200B;

Badger (trying to be diplomatic/just bone tired): Here's a taqueria, I'm fine with this if everybody else is.

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: The portions of Mexican food are tiny, I won't get enough to eat here!

&amp;#x200B;

Badger: There are other restaurants further down the riverfront, but I thought you wanted to go to the closest one.

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: 404.exe

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth (....after a long pause): OK fine I'll eat here (proceeds to sulk through the rest of the conversation).

&amp;#x200B;

Me (do *not* want to deal with KingOfTheSouth at this point): We passed a burger joint on the way over here, I think I'm going to eat there.

&amp;#x200B;

TheGoodDoctor &amp; JimmyRustle: Cool, we'll join you.

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth, Badger, and HandleWithCaution end up going to the Mexican place, while myself, TheGoodDoctor, and Jimmy go to the burger joint. Nothing FPS-worthy at the burger place, so fast-forward to me catching up with HandleWithCaution the next morning:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Morning""

&amp;#x200B;

HandleWithCaution: ""Morning, you missed a shitshow last night""

&amp;#x200B;

Me (sensing juicy gossip): ""You can't say that and then not fill me in""

&amp;#x200B;

HandleWithCaution (obviously trying not to laugh): ""Badger and I had a great time, but KingOfTheSouth was impossible""

&amp;#x200B;

\[Aside: At this point, none of us had spent time with Badger outside of work-we just knew him as Mr. Married to the Job and didn't realize he let his hair down off hours, so this was a pleasant surprise\]

&amp;#x200B;

Me (probably salivating at this point): ""Go on....""

&amp;#x200B;

HandleWithCaution: ""So Badger and I ordered two tacos each, and KingOfTheSouth just ordered alcohol at first. Then he changed his mind and ordered a few tacos; he got *really* mad when my and Badger's meals came out first"".

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""What did he think was going to happen?!""

&amp;#x200B;

HandleWithCaution: ""Don't interrupt. His food showed up, and he ordered a second drink. He finished before we did, complained it wasn't enough food, and he ordered another couple tacos and a drink. Badger and I finished before his second order came out, and he got annoyed that we were 'making' him eat fast when it did show up"".

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Facepalm.mp4

&amp;#x200B;

HandleWithCaution: ""Then when the bills came out, he got upset that his was like $40  while Badger and I paid $15 each. Called the place a ripoff and insisted we not eat there again \[i.e. tonight\]. Then he tried to not leave a tip because he 'didn't have to', so Badger and I had to explain to him that he was being a cheapskate, especially when he put in so many orders"".

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""What an asshole"".

&amp;#x200B;

HandleWithCaution: ""Pretty much""

&amp;#x200B;

MAIN COURSE: Turns out it's just ""Diabetes"" in Spanish too.....

The whole day consists of a tour of a sprawling factory complex- get up at 6:30, start tours at 7:30 or so, quick lunch break, then back to a walking tour until 4PM. Needless to say, we are all exhausted at the end of it, and decide to go to the same area for dinner. I forget if it was sheer coincidence or because we knew there'd be available parking there, but we wind up in the same lot as the night before, which also means the taqueria is the first restaurant we pass.

&amp;#x200B;

HandleWithCaution: I'm going to eat here again, I'm tired and the food was good last night.

&amp;#x200B;

Me (not against Mexican but *really* don't want to eat with JimmyRustle or KingOfTheSouth if I can help it) : I'm not feeling it, anybody else want to do pizza instead?

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: No, that place (referring to the taqueria) is so expensive and they don't give you enough food!

&amp;#x200B;

TheGoodDoctor &amp; JimmyRustle: We really don't care, but we might as well see what the wait is for a table if HandleWithCaution is eating here either way; you can sit at the bar while we sort it out

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone: Fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, we all ended up just staying at the taqueria because nobody could agree on an alternative, and eventually get a table. They track bar and restaurant tabs separately (probably something to do with liquor laws), so the people drinking have to close theirs out before joining the rest of us.

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: ""I'm not going to tip the bartender, I didn't drink that much (he'd had multiple drinks in &lt; 1 hour) and you only tip waiters!""

&amp;#x200B;

HandleWithCaution: ""Stop being so stingy, and he's paid in tips just like the waiters here!""

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: ""Fine, but I'm not going to let them rip me off again!""

&amp;#x200B;

I have no clue what he means by this, but he closes out his tab and joins the rest of us at a table.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently going to a place that didn't serve Real 'Murican-sized portions of food was *deeply* offensive to KingOfTheSouth, and he sat a few places down from us at the table (there were empty spots since it sat at least 8 and Badger wasn't joining us) and just played with his phone. The waiter comes by, and we ask for a few more minutes. Waiter comes back, the rest of us order food, but KingOfTheSouth just orders more liquor.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""You're not eating anything?""

&amp;#x200B;

KingOfTheSouth: ""The portions of food are so small, but if I order drinks they don't make as much money!""

&amp;#x200B;

..... I have no words for this idiocy/douchebaggery. KingOfTheSouth spends the rest of the night drinking, ignoring us, and trying to scam the waiter for free drinks, all because he couldn't get his beetus fix. And of *course* we have to pressure him to actually leave a tip this time as well.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL,DR: More food has more calories *and* costs more money..... whodathunkit. Also, tipping is a waste of money but eating and drinking enough for 3 people isn't.

&amp;#x200B;

fatpeoplestories,"Hey Redditors! 


I don’t ever post on here, I’ve been a long time lurker and finally decided to type one of my experiences my family and I seem to go through....daily...

To keep things to the point and somewhat vague, we will refer to Hammeth planet the IV by “Dad.” Simply because he is my step father and I wouldn’t want anyone whom uses reddit to recognize who I am, or who he is. Because I do talk about him A LOT to my friends. 



Dad has always been there for me, my sisters and my mother. Despite his egomaniac, nobody-can-tell-me-what-to-do-because-i’m-always-right attitude, deep down in between all those fat filled folds I know he genuinely cares about the family’s well-being. He is employed as a realtor, and has always had this steady interest in real estate in general. For a person his size, he makes good money for what he does, running his own realty business and all. To be honest, he’s a lot like Trump in some ways, but I’ll save that for another post.  


This man weighs about 330 lbs and is 5’7 from what I remember. He claims he can’t walk long distances, hence is why he always calls, texts or yells for either of my sisters or myself to assist him when he wants that grape Fanta from thy fridge. He pants, sweats, and he definitely has that big bulbous belly you see first before his actual freaking face when he turns the corner. Now, when he’s out actually doing his job which requires showing houses, driving clients around and whatnot, he acts as if he is perfectly capable of everything. All of his ‘ailments’ are nonexistent, and there’s no complaints to be found. He offers to help other people with their house problems, and even offers future assistance with anything and everything. Stuff that is way out of his way, he would go and help a total stranger. Heck, he gets around so much that he is actually well known in my area! You can’t go out anywhere without someone recognizing him and calling him out. 


He knows his stuff when it comes to housing. The realtors go to him when they have questions, and he answers them straight off the bat. He technically runs the place, despite not being the Broker. 


Now, when it comes to my actual FAMILY, it’s a different fuckin’ story. 


Like for instance, we had a bathroom sink problem for weeks. The faucet thing was loose, so whenever you turned the sink’s handles it would be all wobbly. That and water would continue to leak out even if you turned it off. We tell Dad about the problem, asking if he could fix it and he says “Sure. Oh My feet hurt. Oh can you get me a glass of coke?” ....Okay. Later I ask again if he could fix it. “Sure, I’ll do that after I digest my food.” What? My mother finally asks, and he fucking blows up saying he should just quit his job so he could “fix all of the sinks in the world for us, so we don’t have to nag him anymore” when he could go and fix some stranger’s sink in a heartbeat? What? Eventually, we have a family member come and fix the dang sink. But the saaaaaame thing happens every time we have something in the house that needs to be fixed. Hell, I’ve took something in my own hands one time which probably wasn’t smart, cause I really hurt myself. 


But you guys are probably wondering how and where do the socks come in? Well, I’m getting to that. 


We try and persuade Dad to exercise. His famous quote is: “I need to lose some weight first before I exercise.” What the hell does that even mean? He claims that his exercise is moving around at work, but a majority of that is just sitting behind his desk or driving around most of the days. And even while he’s behind his desk, I’ve crept into the file drawers only to find bags of those chip assortments shoved right on top of the folders. Doritos, Cheetos, Smartfood....


And he claims that he didn’t put it there? “O, I don’t know how that got there” or “Your mother puts it there” are the typical responses I get. 


As soon as he gets home, he pretty much becomes completely useless, besides the amount of income he receives. Everything has to be done for him. He claims he is too fat, he knows he is but is doing nothing about it to fix it. For awhile, he’s been on nutrisystem, but was abusing the rules? He would eat the required breakfasts, lunches, and dinners but would still be hungry. So he would eat other stuff like a full bag of family sized chips, or get his favorite from Taco Bell—Gordita crunches or whatever the hell it is. There came a point to where we tried keeping ‘harmful’ snacks out of the house for his sake, and he threatened to leave us, or screamed saying we were eating all the food and leaving him with nothing. 



Garbage.



If anything, his body can just eat the fucking fat off of his flobby body. 



And speaking of eating, Dad wonders why nobody really eats together at the table when it’s dinner time. You know, like how most families together in the evening and I don’t know, discuss how their days went and whatever? Yeah, no. He eats his breakfast at like 6am in the morning, so his lunchtime isn’t too long after that. After constantly texting and calling my mother at like 12pm asking “What’s for dinner,” she always ends up making it earlier than intended because he can’t wait. He has to have it as soon as possible, despite the various food marts and fast food joints he passes on the way back home. Before, when we actually had dinner at a reasonable time, it was and still is one of the most disgusting things ever. After piling his plate with heaping mounds of food to resemble Mount Everest, he would waddle his way back to the table and just instantly start eating. He wouldn’t wait, it would just be too much of an inconvenience waiting for those to assemble, sit and share the meal together. And as he’s eating, he’s acting like the food on his plate is about to take off and leave at any given second. Stuffing his craw with large bites, breathing heavy and coughing. Sometimes, if he was moving too fast prior he would already be panting, schweaty and just gross. Then when he’s done, he will burp up the airy demons from the pits of his stomach and blow his nose into that stupid fucking napkin. 


All while everyone else is still dining. He even does it in public at restaurants, but I suppose he isn’t as....vulgar with it, which is surprising. He asks why I don’t eat at the table anymore. Well I just can’t, for the sake of my own appetite! My mother is normally the only one to eat with him, but eighty-percent of the time she’s eating alone, while he just sits there gossiping about folk. Sometimes, he will just get up, burp and leave to retreat to his recliner. 


But now, I’m just gonna cut to the socks. Every morning after Dad’s shower, he needs someone to put on his socks for him. Someone always has to be in the house, Atleast one person to do it, otherwise the day is cancelled and he refuses to do otherwise. He claims that he is too big to put on his own socks, since his belly is like a giant dome which separates him from his feet. He will spam call, text literally just saying “Socks.” At freaking 7am in the morning. Sometimes, he would barge into someone’s room asking for his socks to be put on. If you lock your doors, he would stomp back to his lay Z boy chair and pout, not even attempting to put them on himself once. My mother would put them on every morning for him, bless her. However, when she leaves to go to some kind of early event, it is up to whomever else in the house to do it. 

I don’t know. I would absolutely love to type more but my thumbs are killing me. I just needed to type this somewhere. Does anyone else have to put their relative’s or even a friend’s socks on simply because they are too fat? And if you don’t, will they throw and insane fit and cancel all plans? 

TL;DR: Ham Too big to put socks on, or to apply himself in any situation that requires moving unless if it’s strangers/friends that need help.

me, ""mymass"" having a halloween sleepover with about 8 girls. 5'3 17 years old and gaining weight (peak at 126) dressed as a witch (wore a child's large since the adult costumes felt too... ""adult"")

Hama, 17 years old 5'8 shaped like a bowling pin but doesn't, guest at the party. She at this point caused several scenes, said she was gonna call her mom for us ""ganging up on her"", ate almost all the food, walked in on me almost naked, stole my clothes, and ate some more. (Not necessarily in that order)


The night was going pretty well. The only other scene Hama made was we started doing dog piles on each other and laughing and apparently it ""feels really weird when Mymass laughs on you"" cue everyone making me lay on them so we make an X stomach to stomach and making me laugh. I had a gap between each laugh so my stomach was fully relaxing then contracting and what was fun for like 5 minutes turned into her new obsession. In the future she'd bring it up weekly or ask me if I remembered it. Like yeah? You literally talked about it 3 days ago.

ANYWAY, the really interesting bit happened the next morning.

As my mom made cinnamon rolls and was about to turn on her show, who else shows up than Hama? She plops on one of the barstools near the island and starts chatting up my mom. 

Now one thing I asked my mom to get for the party was this stuff that was shaped like a fruit, but was a little bottle full of basically pixie-stick powder that was flavored like the fruit. They had bags at the local dollar store so not a big deal, she got like 3 or 4 bags of them. I had maybe 2 and felt kinda ill, my sweet tooth having friend ate 4 or 5. Some people would start them and couldn't finish them or didn't want to. This is all very important.

As Hama spoke to my mom she started grabbing one of the bottles and downing them. She ate one in the time it took my mom to: take a tray off the oven, put it in the oven, check the temperature, and look back. And guess what she was talking to my mom about? Me.

""Mymass eats SO MUCH! *gulp* yesterday she ate almost an ENTIRE pizza! *gulp* It's just not fair that she gets to eat whatever she wants and stay so thin when I've been dieting for weeks. *gulp* You should honestly get her tested *gulp* to see if she's got some weird disorder that makes her not gain weight. *gulp* I've been tested and they tell me I'm healthy but I know I'm not *gulp* No one could work out as much as me and still be gaining weight *gulp* and it sucks even more now *gulp* cuz our other friend is dieting and losing weight so much faster than me *gulp*.""

My mom tried saying ""maybe you're just gaining muscle!"" But Hama just kept going on and on.

Something about how girls are all anorexics these days. That real girls have curves. Mocking guys that like thin girls and then complainging about guys only liking anorexics and that those girls should end up getting beat cuz they deserve it. (My mom was physically abused and this cow in front of her is basically saying her daughter deserves to be attacked for being skinny) *This* is when my friend came in. 

Both accounts are pretty similar. My mom took all the cinnamon rolls she just made covered them in homemade icing, put them all on a plate and handed it to Hama. Hama ate 2 before she asked why my mom gave her so many. My mom said something like ""You've been eating this whole time, so you must be hungry. Besides I thought you could use real food instead of just putting all that garbage in your mouth"" 

Hama started saying that she actually eats really healthy at home. That she NEVER eats like this. General defensive bs. My friend came in the kitchen and got seated which made Hama clam up. 

My mom kept making veiled jabs. Like asking Hama if she was tested for diabetes ""I heard it makes you crave sugar, so it would make a lot if sense."" ""Your parents tested your thyroid 4 times? Why?"" ""It's weird when girls only dye one strip of hair. Just looks dumb"" (she just dyed her hair from that look a few days prior)

When I went to the kitchen it ended, later my mom told me she wasn't allowed back to the house and I didn't hear the end of how ""weird"" my mom was for the next few months.

fatpeoplestories,I remember after a flight he sat down and left an greasy imprint op and and a bunch of others are laughing their ass off,Anyome got the story about a ham who had trouble going up stairs on 4chan?
fatpeoplestories,"Again: i ""mymass"" was 17 5'3 and probably on the uptick in weight at that point. Highest was 126.

Hama was 17 5'8 and very large (and had a boyfriend)

My brother's are in their 20's and both were football players in highschool (so for the most part were fairly strong dudes). Oldest is lean and 6'1 middle is fat and 5'10 (at this point he passed for husky but he really ballooned since)

So after I got some food and we started watching shows Hama starts asking me about my brothers and where they are. I said they were in their rooms and I asked them not to bother us. She goes on and on about not getting to see my brothers and that she needed her dose of eye candy. ""Atleast get your oldest brother to come say hi"" i basically told her not to under any circumstances go to get either of my brothers or go to their rooms or she wouldn't be invited back to my house. She sulked.

She brought them up a time or two and eventually one came out for some snacks. She shot up and ran to the kitchen. Half an hour later she comes back with a giant plate of food and grinning ear to ear ""You didn't tell me these were your BROTHER'S pajamas teehee I was so embarrassed when he asked me where I got them teehee. We ended up talking for sooooooo long teehee."" I said something like ""well you did bring your own so feel free to wear those."" She refused.

An hour or two later one of our thirstier friends brings up the topic of hot actors. I admit I did have my own celebrity crush at the time and it being one of my first (i think maybe my actual first) I was happy to be able to join in one of these conversations for once. 

We basically went around in a circle talking about and showing pictures of the celebrities we thought were hot. Mostly the cast of supernatural and other similar dramas. People would comment about slmething ""he has nice eyes!"" Stuff like that. There's always something nice you can say. It got to me and I brought up a picture of the actor I liked. Basically a muscular guy with dark hair and a beard in his early 20's. The person next to me was Hama and for the most part she had been pretty quiet this whole time. 

I pass her my phone with the google image up and she said something to the effect of ""I don't really see the appeal"" and passed it on. Now I was already super uncomfortable sharing something like that, but I really liked being a part of 'girl talk' and everyone seemed so nice and happy until this comment. I immediately felt like shit and INCREDIBLY awkward. Thankfully the other girls weren't assholes and agreed that he was hot and after it got back to me it was Hama's turn. 

She said that her crush was her boyfriend and she'd show us a picture but we couldn't handle a *real* man. She started saying that liking those guys was gross and we should like guys like her boyfriend. That she had a guy and didn't need to fantasies about other men (pointedly glaring at the girls with boyfriends). She was really being venomous and down right bitchy. It caught us all off guard at the suddenness and the drastic difference between her and the previous atmosphere, so our normal filters were gone simply out of shock.

The girl that started it all asked her what she was talking about and you'd think Hama was asked her weight. Hama begins SHOUTING that she just CAN'T find men other than her boyfriend attractive and that she was uncomfortable this whole time. That no one was considering how she felt and that it was making her sick how half the room had boyfriends and could just talk about OTHER men like that (we were gushing, but no one was like ""I want to do the sex with this man! Let me count the ways"" it was very ""omg his hair and his eyes *girly noises*""). 

Now I don't know who said it, because I was still halfway through my train of thought derailing. But SOMEONE just chimed in a ""what the fuck dude"" and soon everyone was pointing out all the times she'd been talking about other dudes all day and all week even. That she was being a hypocrite and that it was dumb. Pretty much everyone had a different example of her blatant thirst and she was being bombarded. Literally  no one was taking her shit, but honestly it was more of a ""dude what are you talking about? You-"" and not actually attacking her. I still found it pretty refreshing.

After everyone calmed down for a second she just said ""that's different! Those guys are real!"" And the thirsty friend said ""isn't it worse to like a guy that you go to school with than a dude that lives literally across the country? Like we might joke about abs but literally nothing can come from it. You're always talking about guys that you actually talk to or have class with.""

Hama ate air for a bit then left the room and said she was calling her mom to pick her up cuz everyone was ganging up on her. She didn't, she just got another plate of food and sulked the rest of the night eating SO MUCH FUCKING CANDY guys. Like it was easily 2 halloween bags in a suburb worth of candy that she downed in a night.

Anyway, that's part 2. Stay tuned for part 3 when Hama talks to my mom!",Hama the Jealous Whale: My sleepover part 2
fatpeoplestories,"I mentioned that at one point Carnie had been coming over to watch her TV shows at my house but that stopped when she started watching Hulu and Netflix at home, which was better for everyone. But at some point after that, we started doing ""movie night"" every few weeks, picking a night when both our husbands were otherwise occupied. She'd bring over some movie she'd bought or rented and I'd provide the popcorn and drinks and we'd watch movies. I didn't always like her choice in movies, but she was just lonely and needed the company. We always watched her choice of movies because it was just easier to watch what she wanted to watch than to convince her to watch something I liked. 

  
This story really isn't about the movies, though.   
   
I always hosted movie nights because I wouldn't go to her house – her three dogs were poorly socialized and mean. They hadn't trained the dogs at all, unless you count training them to be mean so they would scare anyone who might want to break in. Carnie, however, always laughed and thought it was ""cute"" that they were so protective. She didn't think they would actually hurt anyone and didn't really understand why no one liked her dogs.   


And maybe it was a good thing that they were so protective, given the part of town they lived in, but she really needed to understand why friends/potential friends might be afraid of them rather whining via memes on facebook about how ""misunderstood"" pitbull mixes were. One of the dogs tried to attack me once. She had him on the leash at the time so I was able to jump back, but he caught my shirt in his mouth and ripped it. (She giggled about it and laughed that he was just ""overly excited"". She didn't apologize or even feel embarrassed about it.) The next time I stopped by, she promised to have them locked them in crates, but then they just barked and snarled the whole time making it difficult to carry on a conversation and gave me a headache.  On another occasion when she had someone else at her house, she locked the dogs in the bedroom, but that didn't work either: there was a cheap cork board door and they ripped through it to get into the living room to defend their property.   
 

Point being, part of her loneliness probably had a lot to do with having no money to go out and do things, but she couldn’t invite friends over to her house either, so she needed some friend who was willing to invite her over.   
Meanwhile, on my side of town, I have been doing a trap-and-release program with the stray cats, taming them enough to catch them, get them spayed/neutered, shots, and sometimes finding homes for them. Call me the crazy cat lady, but I just have a soft spot for strays and I'm a bit of a cat whisperer. Of course, I'm never going to solve the Stray Cat Problem, but I can't help but try to do what I can to reduce the animal population and maybe avoid the spread of rabies. At the time of this story, I was working on taming a couple of sibling feral cats just enough to bring them to a friend who lives on a farm because he wanted a couple of barn cats who might be good mousers.   


One morning I realized one of my indoor cats was scratching and upon closer inspection, noticed he'd ripped a lot of the hair out from behind his ears. This explained some of the little ""rash"" my ankles. My house was infested with fleas! Ug! I was mortified! 

  
My husband wasn't amused and lectured me about being more careful with those strays and that if I'd had any sense, I'd have been flea treating them from the beginning! Yes, dear, you're right! I felt awful about all the trouble we had to go through, but chalked it up to a lesson learned. We set to cleaning the house to rid ourselves of the fleas and treating all the cats, including the strays I could get close enough to.   
 

Carnie was asking about coming over for movie night, and I put her off because I didn't want to admit my house was flea infested. She, even more than my husband, had thought I was a foolish working with the stray population, so I imagined she'd make some kind of snippy ""I told you so"" comment about how this is what I get for messing with the stray cats in the first place when she found out. Look, at this point in our friendship, we may have started to move more into a  bit of a ""frenemies"" relationship.  I admit that I would go into ""Mom Mode"" with her sometimes  when I thought she was acting ridiculous and childish, and I'd likely hurt her feelings by doing it. At sometimes I felt like she was looking for ways to zing me back, and I understood that. So I fully expected in this case for her to be giddy about getting to lecture me in an ""I told you so"" way about the stray cats and I simply didn't want to hear it while I was still fighting the flea infestation.  


But more importantly than that, I didn't want her to come over because she had dogs at home and I might not have had kind feelings towards her dogs, but I still didn't want to inflict fleas on them. So I just put her off a couple of weeks.

  
When the infestation was over, I gave in when she wanted to come over for a movie night. After she came in and sat down and I was putting the movie in the DVD player, I admitted to her what had been going on. ""I should warn you, we've had a bit of a problem with fleas lately. I'm 99% sure they're gone, but before you leave, you'll probably want to use that flea spray stuff on your clothes, just to be safe.""  
 

I half expected she might be upset, and say something like, ""What?? You didn't warn me you might have fleas before I came over??"" because that might have been my reaction if the positions were reversed.   
 

Look at me, expecting a ""normal"" reaction from Carnie. I'm hilarious!!  
 

Instead she just laughed it off. ""*Oh, don't worry about that. My dogs already have fleas. Tee hee hee! Oscar won't stop scratching all the time; I think he's got it the worst. He's probably had them for a few weeks now.*""

…

…  
 

I was stunned. To this day, I still have a hard time imagining anyone laughing off having fleas in their house! She didn't think it was a big deal at all.  


I guess it's no surprise she wasn't treating them for fleas, as her pets were getting no routine care at all. Two dogs were female and one was a male, none of them fixed, so often I had to listen to her complaining about how one of the female dogs was in heat and she had to keep the animals apart because they didn't want puppies. But of course she had no money to pay for them to be spayed or neutered or even get their annual shots. I would send her the information about the low-cost spay and neuter program they had in town, but she wasn't interested. 

  
I told her, to be sensible -- *at least* get the male dog neutered as a precaution. Neutering, after all, is generally cheaper anyway. She didn't care.  Thankfully, no puppies ever resulted; however, one of her female dogs ended up with some sort of uterine infection that would have been avoided had she been spayed. The dog ended up having an emergency hysterectomy that I'm certain Carnie's mother ended up paying for.

  
(And just a note about her mother: I had met Carnie's mother a couple of times and she seemed like a reasonable person of sound-judgement and maturity, with a good career and a stable life – not a Carnie at all! I don't know how she screwed up in raising Carnie. Sometimes wished I'd had Carnie's mother's phone number so we could have had some ""How Do You Solve A Problem Like Carnie"" chats.)

  
Back to the fleas.

  
After I got over my initial stunned reaction, I started to think about how it wasn't that surprising she had fleas. She lived in a run-down part of town, in a small apartment building with low-income neighbors who moved in and out fairly quickly. She also worked at a really run-down, cheap motel with odd clientele. I'm not trying to knock all poor people, only that in those situations there might be more opportunities to catch or spread fleas.   


**Me""** (slowly) ""Wait a minute. Did… did YOU bring the fleas into my house?""  
 *Carnie: ""Huh?""*  
 **Me:** ""My husband has been ranting at me for three weeks about how I brought fleas into the house from playing with the strays, but now you tell me you've had fleas for *weeks now* and you were coming over to my house during that time without warning me? Carnie, how do I know the fleas didn't come from you??""  
 *Carnie: ""Well, you probably DID get them from the strays!! You don't know it's my fault! I don't think it works like that anyway. Tee hee hee!""*  
 **Me:** ""Actually, I’m pretty sure it does work that way!""   
 

I was scrambling in my mind trying to figure out the timeline of the last time she'd been over in regards to the outbreak, and it seemed to kind of line up. I was just furious!

  
I turned to Mom Mode again and I gave her a stern lecture about treating her dogs and keeping them healthy, not to mention her own health, not to mention MY health and any coworkers (or hotel guests!) she might carry fleas to! Basically I told her to grow up and be an adult, that fleas weren’t funny and explained what she needed to do to get rid of them. I even gave her some of the stuff I'd been using on my cats and around the house. She sulked and acted all offended like I was being nasty and mean, even though I was just trying to wake her up. 

  
To this day I'm convinced, the damn fleas came from her! I've continued to work with the feral cat population in the years since and have never had a problem with fleas again. And the worst part was she just tried to laugh it off!  
 

Remember boys and girls: ""**Don't invite Carnie!!**""  
 

At this point I was rather sick of her shit and avoided inviting her over anymore, yet I continued to take her calls and answer her text messages purely for the entertainment value. And trust me, she continued to be entertaining.",Cousin Carnie [Part 5]: The Infestation

fatpeoplestories,"Honestly it has been SOOOO long since I wrote about Hama! Today while snacking I remembered this fun little exchange and wanted to take a break from studying.

Cast:
Me ""Mymass"" 17 years old and getting a little squishy at 125 lbs and 5'3

Hama 17 years old 5'8 and shaped like a bowling pin but still somehow has no ass. Definitely over 200 lbs.

my brothers: oldest bro (OB) 23ish 6'1 and lean. Middle Bro (MB) 21ish years old 5'10 and fat but still looks and was strong. (Come up later)

My mom: late 40's and still in recovery from many surgeries, 5'4 150 lbs. Still cooks when my friends are over (with help) because she is paranoid that they'll tell their parents I have a bad mom and that I'll lose my friends because of it. She is very old school and is uptight about the perception of others.

[There were a lot of other girls including Ari (from a past story) but they aren't super duper important for this so just imagine like 7 teen girls that are healthy weights]

ON TO THE STORY

I had a halloween sleepover with a bunch of my friends. There was candy everywhere and even a chocolate fountain. We were all set up and about half the girls were there already when the sound of a car slamming to a stop made me flinch. The ground started shaking and it kept getting closer. Soon the doorbell rang and the closest girl to the door goes to answer it.

""MYMASS! HAPPY HALLOWEEN!"" Shouts the psychward patient as it lunges at the unsuspecting girl. A thin twig of a guy is standing on the porch behind her and a car is idling outside. 

I approach Hama and tap her on the shoulder which got her to dislodge from the poor girl trapped in her folds. Hama looked at me for 2 seconds before screaming ""OMG YOU'RE NOT DRESSED YET WHAT THE FUCK?!"" In fact I wasn't dressed because everyone decides to show up half an hour early. I explained that I was about to get dressed when I really got a good look at her costume.

She was wearing a hospital gown and had fake cuts all over her neck, arms, and legs. She wasn't wearing pants and that confused the heck out of me because she always complained about being cold. She must have noticed something and decided to explain her costume-

""Oh! I'm an escaped psychward patient teehee!"" She turned to show me the back and to my horror it was WIDE OPEN and she had on only a pair of men's boxers. ""I'm only wearing boxers with this teehee cuz you're supposed to be naked under but I didn't want to give your brothers any ideas teehee. These are [her boyfriend's name]'s boxers by the way. He almost didn't let me steal them till he heard you had brother teeheeheehee"" I said something about it seeming impractical to wear when we were gonna be hanging out and watching movies. She just teehee'd and after a second looked down the hall (towards the kitchen) and pushed right past me to rush to the kitchen to see what my mom had made for snacks.

I had to make awkward small talk with her boyfriend till he handed me Hama's overnight bag and finally got in her mom's car.

That only took a minute or so. I told my friends I was going to get changed and to please let any of our friends in when they show up. I went to my room and started getting changed, but didn't lock the door because I literally just told everyone I was going to get changed.

A minute or two later my door flies open and a very distressed Hama is stomping in my room and slamming my door. I am at this point shirtless and pantsless, bent over to pull up my witch dress. I shout at her and yank the dress on. She made a comment about me not having anything worth seeing anyway. 

Then Hama immediately starts ranting to me about how my mom was being all backwards and old fashioned. That my mom told her that her outfit was inappropriate for a minor to wear and that there were men in the house (no my mom was not implying that my bro's would do anything to her she was genuinely worried Hama would try to hug them and do something sketchy then claim rape because she was basically naked and then try to ruin their lives)

Hama goes to my closet and throws it open. Grabs my largest pajama shirt and pants (both were one of my brother's but i stole them cuz they were soft. Men's XXL's). She put on the pants then tossed the hospital gown, flashing me (god I can't understand how a 17 year old can have such saggy tits). She put on my pj shirt and stomped out of the room. Both the pants and shirt seemed almost at capacity but not quite seam bustingly full.

I went to the living room and 6 of the 8 girls were there and half were dressed up (wasn't mandstory). Hama was sitting in the recliner with a plate piled HIGH with the snacks my mom made (pigs in a blanket), i noticed 2 more plates with one or two left that were sitting between the group of girls on the bigger couch and the girls on the smaller couch. i went to the kitchen to get some for myself and my mom was just putting a batch in but there weren't any others around. 

Apparently when I had left 3 of the girls went to make a shared plate of food. Hama was eating directly from the serving plate and god knows how many she ate before this happened. She realized she could get a plate and I immediately piled a plate high. She would have taken the rest if one of the 3 girls hadn't decided to make a plate for the other 2 that were still getting settled in the living room.

When Hama had turned to go to the living room my mom saw her back and told her to get changed. That's why she stormed into my room and didn't just get her bag from the living room that had her own clothes in it.

Within 20 minutes Hama had made a scene, walked in on me almost naked, stolen my clothes, and taken almost all the food. 

Preview: 
Part 2- when boys get brought up and Hama is a self contradicting hypocrite.

Part 3- the next morning when Hama tried to hang out with my mom. (Based on my mom's side of the story and what one of my friends walked in on)

fatpeoplestories,"This is a twofold WTF...

When I was in high school 20 years ago, there was a math teacher who was MASSIVE. The kind of massive when the pannus hangs over the knees and is tucked into her pants. She wore her hair very short, I suspect because her arms were too big to hold up long enough to brush. Easily 500 lbs at 5 foot 5. She had a special accommodation from the principal to wear sweatpants and and T-shirts because there were simply no work-appropriate clothes available to fit her. (This was before online shopping was popular and Amazon only sold used books) I’d guess her age as being in her 50s. 

WTF #1 was her daily lunch. She would waddle from her classroom to the cafeteria carrying a wooden inbox (where students would turn in their papers) and would return with the inbox piled high with cafeteria food. She was using a freaking inbox as a lunch tray because her lunch was so big she couldn’t carry it. 

WTF #2 takes a sadder turn. I got word that she died last year. She was 52.  52? That would mean she was 32 when I was in high school and thought she was in her 50s! Her terrible diet had aged her so dramatically that she looked so much older!

She was bummed as they were leftovers from her anniversary dinner at outback. She thought maybe the cleaners accidentally tossed it. Accidents happen, then my lunch went missing. I was pissed I ended up with a crappy cafe chicken salad. A few days later my lunch goes missing again, I’m livid at this point. I decide to do some detective work, I pack a bomb lunch that night and then I set my trap. I deduced that the lunches were disappearing between 12:30-1:00 so I camped out near the break room. Now we have several ham planets that work for my company so my list of perpetrators was long. It’s 12:45 and two ham planets we will call Andy and Linda go into the break room, I decide to swoop in. What do you know Linda and Andy have three lunch bags not belonging to them and are helping themselves to my lunch, and two other employees lunches. 
I ask them what the hell they think their doing and they pull the “oh we thought these were our lunches.”

fatpeoplestories,"Back when I used to work for a popular Senior living Care center, I was a front desk receptionist for part of the day, and in the back also an administrative assistant. It was a pretty bad, pretty shity job barely making minimum wage, and working hours that I wasn't supposed to be schedule for as a part-time worker. From 3 till 11 p.m. sometimes I'd still be there just to babysit the desk. Good times.



In the morning when I would open which would be from 7 to sometimes 4:30 if someone didn't come in for their shift I'd have to stay longer, let's see some pretty interesting things. As you know office environment breeds ham, and ham foolery types. Being the normal sized person there at the time coming from overweight to normal weight, for them was the beginning of the Apocalypse as people noticed my transformation and I've took note of some of the how should I say, habits of a few people (and residents, but that's an entirely different story) of the office that really rustled up my jimmies.



One of which was when it came to getting lunch. The front desk for most of these Senior care living centers tends to be next to the lunchroom about a couple feet. When I first started losing weight there, I learned that there was a gym upstairs for the residents that they can use during whatever. I took it upon myself within my 30 minutes to work out for 20 minutes, then spend the remaining ten eating. I started eating upstairs near the gym area because people would make fun of what I was eating half the time. 


""Eating salad again? That's not very healthy.""
""A rye sandwich huh. That's a lot of carbs.""
""Having a cookie? Aren't you losing weight?""


Just small snide comments that I know came from a place of insecurity. I just looked on smiled kept my head low by kept my thoughts to myself. CICO I'd tell them. They'd laugh, then go back to trying a tea that they found that's supposed to make you shit 20 lb.  My manager; I m sorry, hamager in particular was the one to know and critique my lunch choices, taking pride in one of her healthy lifestyle choices she's implementing, she to thought that maybe a salad for lunch would be the healthiest option. 


She was about 5'11, maybe pushing 400 lbs. Her feet were swollen all the time, she kinda looked like a puffy marshmallow.

Wholeheartedly I supported her, noting and commenting on her big step, even though comments aside she didn't deserve it. What follows next is something that's still boggles my mind. 



Hamager: mooncosmicbitchslap, I'm going on lunch.

Mbslp: Ok. I'll forward all calls to Voicemail.


30 minutes pass. Front desk starts get picked up so I'm behind on my work. I know the door closed from behind me and I can smell the scent of a hamburger going to the manager's office. 


Mbslp: do you still want me to forward all calls?

Hamanger: yes. I'm still having my lunch.

Mbslp: ok, cool cool. Will do.


Another hour passes. Things kind of trickle for a little bit. I let my manager know that I'm about to head out for lunch. 



She says, "" I'm going to step out for a moment, so just wait for a few minutes, ok""?


I see my manager waddle to the lunchroom once more. She comes back with a tray, a small plate bowl of salad a huge plate of fries and a huge cup of dressing. Like a coffee mug full of dressing. Ranch dressing. Gleeful smile on her face as she rushes to her office. 


"" Didn't finish my lunch."" 


My eyes glance over to her room. There's a liter of Sprite already halfway guzzled, and a tray already sitting there demolished what looks like to be remnants I want was once known as a hamburger and fries. 


the whole time I'm just captivated by the giant mug that is of dressing and I asked if she plans on using it all. 


I have no filter, no shame. 


She says she doesn't like really the taste of salad. At this point noting the croutons that mostly make up the salad. 


She steps into her office, slowly closing the door. 


I wish I could say that I could hear her eating but honestly I was just so flabbergasted by the amount of dressing, I did a rough estimate, turns out she had about 200 calorie cup of dressing with her. That was roughly two-thirds of my lunch.


That day I worked harder than ever in the residents gym. It made me realize that some people want to see you fail, some people are totally fine and capable of lying to themselves. 


But I decided I wouldn't be one of them.


I have more stories about her but they're not really fat people story related. One of which she tried to steal my girl scout cookies that I ordered months in advance. They happen to conveniently been moved into her office. 

Yeah bitch, of course they were. 


or how in the mornings when she would open someone was supposed to pass out resident newspapers because it was three flights of stairs, she didn't want to do them because it was hard for her to walk. I would have to deliver them while I did resident check-ups because she was too heavy and too lazy to even take an elevator to walk maybe a city block for 20 minutes.

More stories to come.

Edit: I'll be adding her stats

fatpeoplestories,"This is an old story from many years back at my Aunt's workplace. She worked in an office on the ground floor and there was an extremely obese woman who worked with her. This woman would walk out the side door to her car a couple of times a day and drive off for about a half hour. One day my Aunt asked around and was told that the woman had figured out that it was a shorter walk to her car than to the bathroom. She only lived a few minutes away, so she would drive home, use the bathroom just inside her garage door, and drive back rather than walk to the office bathroom.

I'm aware that there may have been other reasons she wanted to use her own bathroom given her size, but, in any case, that's when your obesity has become a problem.

BONUS: There was another large woman who worked in the office and a couple times a week, one of them would come in with two boxes of doughnuts. At some point in the day, they would walk to each other's office and lock the door. One day, my Aunt couldn't help herself and knocked on the door and said she had something important. One of them opened the door after rolling her chair over. They both had napkins stuffed like bibs in their collars, and each had almost an entire box of doughnuts laid out in front of her, minus the ones already eaten. She says they both had the deer in headlights look as they got busted for eating a dozen each at one sitting.

fatpeoplestories,"Mindy was an outspoken anorexic at a BMI of 32. She did not let her anorexia define her. No, she defined anorexia. Self-diagnosed and proud of it, she would tell my middle school friends and me all about the hardships of the anorexia she endured.

It all started on what would have otherwise been a normal Tuesday. Math bored me, no one read the assigned readings, and I reminded all my PE classmates that I still suck at dodgeball. The lunch bell rang and I strode my way to the cafeteria. I grabbed myself a personal cheese pizza and milk, scanned the tables for my friends, and walked over to join them. I neared the table when someone grabbed my shoulder. I turned my head around to see none other than Mindy. Mindy was 5’2” and at least 170 pounds. She wore a tight blue V-neck and black skinny jeans. With her hair tied back harshly in a ponytail, her entire appearance just looked painful.

“Hey, Angelica! Dodgeball was crazy today! Wow!”

She addressed the table.

“Hey, I’m Mindy! Angelica and I have been through SO much together. It’s so sad we haven’t eaten together yet.” 

I only knew her from PE and the only reason I did was because of the warm-up jog. We started every PE class by jogging a lap around the track and the coach wouldn’t continue the class until everyone completed it. What was supposed to take roughly four minutes took eight **every time** because the rest of the class would have to wait for Mindy to finish *walking the jog*. Every single weekday, I had to stand there and watch her stroll the track on her phone. 

I stomached my irritation and set my tray on the table. I then sat down and Mindy plopped herself next to me. My friends noticed my confusion and awkwardness but we were all a bunch of introverts so we didn’t question her. We ate and chatted. Well, we tried to chat but Mindy would often loudly interject whenever she thought up anything remotely pertaining to the topic. She then held the conversation captive with a long rant about a classmate or type of person. 

Despite talking most of the time, she managed to finish her meal before the rest of us. Her lunch was fairly normal: a personal pepperoni pizza, chocolate milk, and a bag of potato chips. I myself had a remaining slice of pizza left, which Mindy then grabbed, took a large bite out of, and looked at me as if to say: “Couldn’t help it, teehee.” She shrugged her shoulders too. 

“Hey, what the hell?,"" I said. The rest of my friends were a mixture of surprised and peeved.

Mindy reacted: “I need this! I’m in recovery!”

I immediately felt guilty but was still offended she hadn’t asked first, and sad that I’d just lost my slice of pizza. My friend Nat asked her, “Oh, are you okay? What are you recovering from?” 

“I’m anorexic.”

I would have thought she was joking if not for the venom that laced her words. No, she was dead serious.

“A lot of people assume anorexics are twigs and beautiful little fairies. That’s just not true, at all. Anorexics are people like me, girls who starve themselves just for guys. I starved myself for *weeks*. But I was too smart to stay anorexic. I realized how bad it got when my dad asked me if I wanted anything from Dairy Queen after dinner. I had only had salads that entire day. Not being able to have ice cream broke me. I just started crying and crying. It was really bad. I’m still getting over it.”

Dead silence.

I never dealt with anorexia myself but I knew Stacy, one of my friends at the table, just had her sister hospitalized for anorexia last week. I looked over at her and she was staring daggers. She didn’t say anything though. Neither did the rest of the group except for some indiscernible mumbling. Finally, someone started up a new conversation and ~~Mindy~~ we talked until the bell rang. The group dispersed and I caught Stacy as she was storming off. I invited her to hang at my place and we ended up having a really good time. Her sister eventually recovered. I can confidently say after enduring many more of Mindy’s ensuing societal rants and food thievery that Mindy never would “recover” from hers. ",Most Anorexics Are Actually Obese
fatpeoplestories,"Hi FPS, Red here with a Friday Eve morsel to keep ya'll sated over the weekend.

Today was our office ornament exchange, and it had the biggest turn out in company history. HR catered Square Chair Pizza, and everybody congregated in the courtyard to open and swap ornaments. (We played a game similar to White Elephant, everyone gets a number, picks a gift, it can be stolen, etc.)

Ya'll know exactly what fucking happened. 

While everyone faced the center of the courtyard, Ginny (presumably under the guise of ""guarding"" the pizza from random people taking any) was in a prime spot to eat as much leftover pizza as her fingers could reach.

J and I watched wide-eyed from across the courtyard the entire time. I know we weren't the only people who saw, because there were a couple stage whispers pointing her out, but she was in the *zone*, ya'll. It was a speed eating contest and she was the only fucking contestant. There were probably six pizzas total left over. In the hour it took us to open the ornaments, Ginny ate *two full pizzas* and tried to fast-waddle away with a third when she realized time was up. One of the other HR ladies actually stopped her and said loudly, ""OH, THANK YOU GINNY, I'LL TAKE THIS TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD ANY UPSTAIRS."" By that time, *everyone* knew what was going on and it was pretty fucking awkward. 

Ginny just released the pizza box and kept walking back into the building with her eyes all glazed over. 

Woman needs help...

**TL;DR**: Driving my happy ass to the desert to watch shooting stars and shit tonight. I think it will be just the right kind of eye bleach.

fatpeoplestories,"I work in a local pizza joint with a morning-afternoon pizza and salad buffet, or as I call it ""Ham Feeding Trough"" about 3 weeks ago a customer starting coming semi regularly for buffet. He's SUPER loud and keeps calling the cook ""buddy"" and  ""pal"" the cook doesn't know this dude at all. He always comes in a orders 2 cookie pizzas or brownies for the buffet. they're 9 inches diameter. And he loudly always says to anyone within earshot how he's a body builder and he has to eat like 7 times a day cause he burns it off so fast. I watch this dude, he eats both cookie pizzas with some other slices of pizza thrown in and doesn't ever touch the EXPANSIVE salad bar that comes with the buffet.

fatpeoplestories,"My dad got fat fished a couple years ago.
 He met this woman on Plenty of Fish, ironic I know, and he knew she was on the heavy side but not horribly so he messaged her.

 He himself isn't that skinny, like right under 200 but that's because of a serious car accident that left him semi disabled, he can walk/work part time but is in allot of pain most of the time. 

Anyway they texted and talked on phone for a month, I know he wasn't too serious about her because he complained about how she droned on. She would talk for a hour or more about her family, her mom whom she lived with and her salt shaker collection. 
Dad decided they might as well meet though and she insisted they meet at Hardees even though he offered a nicer place. Red flag in my eyes! 

When he walked into the restaurant he said he wished he walked right out. She was 100 pounds or more heavier then her pic on her POF profile and was actually ""fat spreading"" to be able to sit on one of the chairs. 
She insisted they eat there and then go back to her mom's place. After my dad watched her pig out, my dad found out her mom dropped her off because she didn't have a car or something so my dad had to drive her to her house.

This woman was so large she couldn't get his truck's seatbelt around her and nearly stretched it out. I remember getting in the passenger the seat a few days later and the seatbelt not being as tight as before. I asked my dad why and he explained it was cause she was so fat.

At her mom's place she showed my dad her salt shaker collection and droned on about them to the point Dad said he was bored to death. He left a few hours later and swore he wouldn't talk to her again. She tried to contact him a few times after but he ignored her",The Hardee's FatFisher.

So i tried to take this guy under my wing in the beginning. I tried to tell him about the benefits of a high fat, high protein, low carb diet (I put a progress pic on this sub that didn't really get noticed, but you can see i've made progress myself). 

I said he should come and lift weights with me, as your overall muscle mass contributes to your maintenance level of calories, etc... He wasn't having any of it. Instead he started doing crossfit. I have a few hang ups about crossfit, but i thought fair enough, as long as he's moving. 

He will constantly snark at anyone who is doing well losing weight, ""It's not healthy to lose weight that fast"" or undermine their efforts ""Yeah well his wife earns loads of money too so he can afford to eat well"" etc etc... He is a constant stream of excuses, and hypocrisy. 

This gentleman is in his mid 40's and I could not believe the day that he came into work, and he'd brought in a rucksack and a bike helmet. He couldn't adjust the straps on either, and asked me to do it. Constantly praising me for being 'good with my hands' (i build cars in my spare time'. 

I honestly wonder how he's made it this far through life, but i guess if he's that dependent on other people, it makes sense that he's also dependent on food.

fatpeoplestories,"**Murrland Tales Thanksgiving

Trigger warning tofu and turkey abuse, obesity, familial abuse, cat platoons, middle class white nonsense, overuse of mascara in the mid-to-late 90s, overly aggressive football coach like aunt, pre Brony My Little Pony desecration, Satanic rituals involving cats and turkey.

So have you guys ever seen in Norman Rockwell painting? The one with the Thanksgiving? That was not my Thanksgivings as a young person.

 Normally we get together with a bunch of relatives that I would kindly refer to as the normal side of the family these guys and gals loved America turkey and arguing at the table about which sub-literate large NFL player was going to run the hand egg pass the go post the most this year

This year we decided to go to the home of an aunt who did not usually go to family functions finding them anxiety-producing and well for lack of better word triggering.
 
 
 This was way before all of this Tumblr stuff and critical theory stuff started. On this year of Our Lord the president was in trouble for ruining dress fabric and Michael Jackson was still alive. On this year we went to the most Godless land a marylander could ever go to.


We went to Virginia.

The roads on the way to my aunts house had the quality of a a cratered shelfield after the battle of the s o m m e. This kind of bumpy complexion also found itself on my cousin who we shall name the gothapotamus. Gothapotamus had two mothers way before Obergefeld V Hodges made it legal.  Aunt hippy and her life partner and owner of the Dodge Durango, my very sporty aunt we shall name coach buzzcut because of her resemblance to the Beavis and Butt-head character.

Gothapotamus had a dad, he was a rolling stone and apparently he was sufficiently distasteful that he convince my aunt to become lesbian. 

My cousin was always kind of weird jumping from fad to fad . She generally maintained a very Marilyn Manson inspired goth attire and a sizable BMI in the mid- 40s. The year before she had apparently told everyone at school that she was Jewish. This year she apparently told her counselor and some of her teachers that she was Pakistani and Indian. I'm pretty sure she had no idea about the geopolitical refutations of of her statements but let's just say she was a great Contender for Proto Tumblr.

My aunts house is kind of weird back then she lived in a place that was initially a single-family Rancher that they stuck on a second floor at a weird angle resulting in some of the windows on the second floor standing in front of what was essentially a near horizontal roof overhang. This is important for our story. Gothapotamus had a lair overhanging the garage area. Ava potamus and her mothers were all cat people and they had six cats of varying size and temperaments. Based on their behavior I consider them to be a platoon of cats.

When we arrived on this blustery Thanksgiving we noticed upon entering that the temperature was cranked up sufficiently high to cause condensation on all of the windows. These people like to keep their house at Arizona temperature and apparently intended to keep Pepco and the entirety of West Virginia's coal mines in business.

My aunt was wearing her typical hippie dress with no bra and flopping boobs, buzz cut look like a 1980s football coach and then there was gothapotamus dressed head-to-toe in floor length black with what could best be termed a long Lolita dress covered in Chains that followed her like a bizarre wedding train if the check from Hellraiser got married. 

Unfortunately this caused her to sweat profusely, rather than just lightening her very complicated a tire she would just douse herself with some cologne spray, this resulted in a combined smell of butter, sweat, and some sort of Herbal Essences tinged smell melting into something awful.
 
She would often not really do a very good job of washing her hair, or she was really into Courtney Love because her hair was stringy and covered in an oily Sheen, dandruff lint and cat hair. My aunts and my cousin had an entire platoon of cats. Curiously they have managed to get them all into gothapotamus is room to prevent them from hopping onto the table and attempting to steal food during the meal.
 
 Whereas she generally jump from fad to fad apparently this month to Buzz Cuts consternation and that no minor cost, she decided she was vegan and could not bear to eat a turkey. She had apparently complained enough about Freedom bird that there was an alternate dish served we were told. When we arrived we saw the incredible holiday spread and what a spread it was. All of The Delectable treats you would imagine that a Thanksgiving feast to celebrate our Noble ancestors victory over dying of starvation in the cold by taking advantage of gullible Noble Native Americans.
 
 At the end of the table there was quite a curious looking contraption that belongs in a Cubist painting. It was as if somebody has made a turkey using tofu cubes. It was something out of a Picasso. 

This monstrosity was apparently a fairly large amount of tofu positioned into the gross effigy of the bird at the other end of the table. When we all sat gothapotamus sat across from me and we discussed our most recent activities whilst we waited for buzzcut to finish carving the bird. 

Eventually someone asked about that Contraption at the end of the table and it turned out that gothapotamus had  recently declared herself vegan and well made enough of a stink that my hippie Aunt went through great expense and time to create the offense to God sitting on the table. 

We all started grabbing food and it became pretty evident that the contraption was not the favorite item of the table.

Gothapotamus began with some of it, and then quickly tries switch over to regular turkey.  Only to be rebuffed by coach buzzcut who told gothapotamus that she needed to eat the $45 of tofu she forced everyone to purchase. 

Her mother of course was less willing to chastise gothapotamus and I had a feeling that she would just pack the Giant turkey tofu Effigy away with the karate GI, the ballet slippers, the juggling set and the tarot cards.

At least on two separate occasions gothapotamus attempted to grab some of that sweet sweet Freedom bird only to be cut off at the pass by buzz cut who use their best drill instructor voice to tell gothapotamus to go eat her tofu abortion.

She also decided to make various statements about how evil the holiday was, how we defended her she wasn't allowed to have food like everyone else. She display the level of eggs falling somewhere between Claire Danes in my so-called life and Lori Petty after rehab. 

Buzz Cuts contact probably wasn't very kind on Thanksgiving As We Know...but back during the days of my so-called life, $45 is a lot of money to spend on what my dad jokingly called solidified communist semen.  

After the kind of awkward conversation that occurs between relatives who haven't spoken in years, We went to get desserts from the kitchen area and this is where things started to get interesting.  While all of us went over to the various pies, gothapotamus sat back with a grinch like expression making me think she had hatched a master plan.
 
There was still a fair amount of turkey meat on that bird like at least enough for a day or two of leftovers at the whole family eating no one had bothered to clean off the bones yet as we sought out are coveted desserts.

 When I returned from acquiring my pecan pie I realized that the turkey has gone missing as gothapotamus. I noticed that one of the cats was out languidly stretching on the staircase decide what appeared to be onion. I journeyed up the stairs to the Lair of the great white whale.  

Her door was covered with a collection of Barbie doll heads and some My Little Ponies hanging on nooses. These are the old 1980s ponies so it was kind of really macabre. I could hear the sounds of Marilyn Manson The Beautiful People blaring out under her door. I slowly grabs door knob and notice it's locked. I run downstairs quickly grab ahold of a butter knife and come back upstairs. My curiosity got the best of me. I thought about not jimmying open the door for a minute then I heard people coming back into the dining room area and buzz cut asking where the hell the bird went.
 
 I popped the lock and what I saw will stay with me for the rest of my days. They were about five cats on the bed surrounding gothapotomus as she clawed at the turkey meat jamming it into her cavernous maw. 

We met eyes and I heard buzzcuts loud insistent complaint about the Turkey. Her eyes plead to me for help. I decide to go enter bro mode for gothapotamus I rushed downstairs and begin trying to distract buzz cut with questions about the local sports ball team. I know enough to get me into trouble and managed to stall for good 7 minutes. Eventually I can no longer stall and buzzcut cause upstairs only to return empty-handed and none the wiser. I ran upstairs and notice how to platter and gothapotamus were gone. 

Eventually gothapotamus appeared again covered in it fairly heavy sweat indicating mild to moderate activity on her part.

 I'm not entirely sure how oh Where She Went at first, or for that matter how the hell she got back down the stairs without us seeing or hearing her I assume that she engaged her stealth powers.

 I also noticed that the entirety of the cat platoon was missing tell her door was open and this will usually result in a cat Exodus of Moses proportions. She sat downstairs and made nice with us for a while until it was time to leave all the while buzzcut kept walking to the fridge and back trying to figure out where the hell the turkey went.
 
 When we left I talking to my parents car and I noticed on the roof the platoon of cats we're just kind of hanging out on the area nearby the window to gothapotamus lair. 

The trip probably took a good while to get home by the time I got home, they had several answering machine messages
Filled with screaming from buzz cut and my aunt about how my cousin has lost her mind and thrown the turkey platter with the turkey remains onto their Dodge Durango...
 
 When I finally spoke to my cousin again she told me that she would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for those cats. Apparently she decided that she was going to eat one remained of the turkey meat and then replace the platter downstairs but she miscalculated how long it would take her to remove meat from the bird and she didn't have a plate. Apparently the cats all decided to be a little judas's and attack the turkey with gusto rather than behaving like her little Unholy Army Of The Night. She had sent the ladder onto the flat area of the roof near her window fully intending to get back to it nothing was further betrayed by the cats that found their way outside. Apparently to add insult to injury something spooked the cats causing them to try to run off the platter, causing them to somehow caused the platter to fall onto the Dodge Durango.
 
 One day that week over lunch with Dad I explain to him with gothapotamus had said. He said that he'd rather believe the whole her throwing the turkey at the car business because it seemed more realistic. Two decades later at my cousin's Antics I kind of agree. For what it's worth since then she converted various other religions enjoying the haes craze because of course she did.

fatpeoplestories,"Hi FPS, Happy Friday Eve. Red here with another story about the ham in HR. I may have been a little bit naughty...

I think that our Division President's comments regarding the pasta lunch either sparked some self awareness, or the Head of HR had a chat with her, but Ginny has been making herself pretty scarce. She came to my desk to bitch that mail for her had been sent elsewhere (it hadn't, she just couldn't find her clearly-labeled mailbox in the mail room) and sneered again at the Cuties in the RedVine tub, but that's all. Until this morning.

My boss had an early morning meeting with his field guys, and brought in a tray of breakfast burritos with fresh salsa for them to nosh on. There were three left over, and as with all leftover food they were placed in the kitchen. 

I was fixing my breakfast and chatting to my favorite IT guy (Pete) when Ginny came into the kitchen and spotted the burritos. 

She then proceeded to aimlessly meander around the kitchen while Pete and I chatted. 

She opened both fridge doors, stared, looked at us, closed the doors, and looked at the burritos.

She wandered to the counter where someone had left a handful of People magazines, shuffled them side to side, looked at us, and looked at the burritos.

She went to the cupboards that hold sodas and water, opened them, looked inside, closed the cupboard, looked at us, and looked at the burritos.

She fiddled with the television remote, didn't turn the TV on, stared at the blank screen for a moment, looked at us, and looked at the burritos. 

It dawns on me that Ginny is waiting for Pete and I to leave the kitchen, so she can take the burritos without being seen. So, for the sake of pettiness, and holding my own freshly made breakfast of eggs, sausage, and orange slices, I move to the counter (maintaining my conversation with Pete) and position myself by the burritos.

&gt;Ooh, what do we have here? Bacon, egg, and cheese burritos! These look good. Oh they're from [local restaurant]! They've got great salsa!

Pete seems interested by my recommendation and moves over to see what's in the tray. Ginny is pretending to rummage through the cupboards for a coffee cup, watching us out of the corners of her eyes.

&gt;You're right, those do look good. I'm pretty hungry this morning - your breakfast looks great!

&gt;Oh, I'm an unholy bitch without breakfast. Most important meal of the day, you know! What did you have?

&gt;I rushed out the door this morning without anything. You said this salsa is good, right? 

Ginny was clearly getting agitated, and was furthermore running out of things to pretend to do. She was wiping a paper towel along the completely dry counter top as Pete reached for a burrito with a napkin.

&gt;These are small - you think [my boss] would mind if I took two?

I *almost* cackled.

&gt;Oh, not at *all*! Help yourself! They'll just go to waste if they don't get eaten!

Ginny couldn't even pretend anymore, she just stared as Pete made himself a plate and poured the salsa on top of the two burritos. There was one, lonely burrito left in the tray, and Pete and I were about to walk out to let her pounce on her much-smaller-than-hoped-for prey in peace when one of our Project Managers walked in for a coffee refresh.

&gt;Oh, burritos! Great!

And he grabbed the last burrito.

Ginny looked absolutely furious, but the PM walked out immediately after refilling his coffee cup, and Pete and I were already on our way out. If she had anything to say, I didn't hear it. 

I giggled all the way to my desk.

**TL;DR**: Ham uses sneak. It is ineffective, and may have hurt itself in its confusion.

edit: spelling",HR Ham Tries a Sneak
fatpeoplestories,"I used to work for an IT company and we had a LOT of Indian staff on my team.

It was tradition that for your birthday (or for big public holidays such as Christmas or Eid) that you bring in treats for your team. These treats were always placed on a cupboard at the end of a bank of desks so that everyone could get to them. 

Now when I say “your team” I mean that they were meant for your team only. Other people might walk past the food and occasionally ask if they could take some and 9 times out of 10 there would be so much left over that we’d let people from other teams take some for themselves (and they’d return the favour!) 

There was one Ham in the office called Ellen that seemed to spend the majority of her time wandering around the office, hunting down these treats. She was especially addicted to samosas and having a large Indian presence on our team, there were a lot of samosa available. 

She never asked “oh, would you mind if I took one?” She’d just grab an entire tray and start walking off. When challenged she’d get angry “these are for my team, I brought them in myself!!”

Nobody ever challenged her as she was quite high up in the company and nobody wanted to get in trouble. Plus the majority of folks ordered their samosa from the same local company, so they were all on these foil trays, making it hard to distinguish who had brought them.

Ellen got away with stealing entire trays of samosas for ages as nobody wanted to challenge her, even after folks had confirmed that she wasn’t handing them out, she was eating them all herself!

That was until Naz’s birthday came around. Now, Naz is Indian and his wife makes the BEST samosas ever. It’s a 3 day process for his wife to make them and she always made a vast amount for our team because she knows how much we all loved them. 

As expected, Ellen came scouting for food and spotted the 3 massive tubs of samosas. Each tub had about 30 samosas in it. Her eyes lit up and she immediately grabbed an almost full tub and started to walk away. As she walked we watched her eat at least 3 of these samosas (and they’re pretty damn big).

We were all gobsmacked but as usual nobody wanted to challenge her... until she walked past Naz’s desk. He glanced up and saw her with the tub and he lost it. He jumped up and yelled at her “how DARE you steal the samosas from my team?! My wife made those for MY team! Not for your fat arse!”

Ellen went pale but immediately tried her usual “No, I brought these for my team! They’re not yours!”

Unfortunately for Ellen she’d made a mistake this time because it wasn’t the usual foil tray full that she liked to steal. The samosas were in large tupperware tubs ***with Naz’s name written across the side in large letters!!***

He immediately pointed it out to her and starting yelling that she’s a fat, greedy thief and everyone knows it! That we all know that she eats them all herself and doesn’t “share them with her team” and that if she didn’t put the samosas back right now and pay him for the ones she’d eaten then he was calling the police and reporting her for theft.

Ellen was crying big fat whale tears and going “well you shouldn’t leave them out if you don’t want people to take them! How was I supposed to know that they were yours?! I can’t help that I’m hungry, you’re just bullying me because I’m fat!”

Naz yelled back “you’re only fat because instead of working you spend all day stealing everyone elses food! You’ve lied about it for years but we all know you’re a greedy cow and we’re fucking sick of you stealing our food!”

He snatched back the box of samosas from her and she stormed off crying. 20 minutes later, Ellen’s boss came stomping over, demanding to talk to Naz for “bullying” Ellen about her weight.

Naz refused to back down and everyone on the team backed him up, telling Ellen’s boss exactly what she spent her days doing. That instead of working she spent the whole day scouting the office for food and stealing it.

The big boss went quiet and left. Apparently he started asking around Ellen’s team to see if she was sharing the food and nobody had any idea what he was talking about. The standard response was “what food?”. 

Shortly after that, Ellen suddenly disappeared... we can’t prove it but we’re pretty sure she was fired. Funny how no samosas have gone missing since she “left”...

fatpeoplestories,"Guys, I snapped.

Remember Marshmallow from [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/91itlp/haes_debunked_in_one_zumba_class/?st=joxt946e&amp;sh=40f701b9)? I finally snapped at her. 

I went to this brand's event and they had invited a lot of people, so even small wannabe ""beauty bloggers"" like Marshmallow was there. 

When I arrived, Marshmallow was holding court with a bunch of girls I don't recognize. From her bellowing, it sounded like she was passing herself off as a veteran of the beauty industry who can guide them into social media stardom. I found out Marshmallow has been ""blogging full time"" for maybe about nearly a decade now, so her Youtube subscriber (34k) and IG follower (12k) are kind of sad. Especially since if you're an actual veteran of the industry, you'd notice her growth &amp; engagement is kind of wonky and highly suspect, suggesting loads of bought followers, views &amp; likes. 

&gt;""IGISNOTREALLIFE! OH MY GAWD!"" I heard her helium screech. 

Shit. I've been noticed.

&gt;""BABE! It's been! SO! LONG!"" she yelled as she forced me into a hug. 

Can this count as sexual assault? 

I definitely don't know her well enough to be on hugging terms, but I think she just wanted to pretend she was close to all the bigger bloggers. 

She was wearing some overwhelmingly sickly sweet, powdery perfume that punches you in the nose, once you're pressed against her, you notice this weird, sour smell lingering on her body. And like many people of an overly large size, she was perpetually sticky. Her makeup was so cakey, I felt like I got bashed with a puff of powder during that hug. 

I tried to extricate myself as politely as I can, but Marshmallow held on to my hand.

&gt;""Babelettes!"" Marshmallow bellowed again, yes she was one of those people who like coming up with stupid nicknames or phrases, hoping they'd stick, ""This girl here! Is sooooooooo talented! Do you know she made it big for her *[racial feature]*?""

I mentioned this before so I'll be brief. Basically, I became known for having an ethnic feature that's typically considered ""ugly"" and that's how I got into the #effyourbeautystandards movement and ended up getting introduced to this sub. I still think beauty standards are fucked up and kind of racist, because features that are more predominant among white people (lighter skin, straight hair, narrow noses, large eyes with creases, etc.) are considered beautiful and ethnic features people can't change without sketchy products/surgery (dark skin, very curly hair, wide noses, monolids, etc.) are typically considered ""ugly"" and in need of fixing. I really thought #effyourbeautystandards was about that for the longest time and didn't realize it was mostly a weight thing, which you can totally change if you want to. I don't want to give out too much info that may lead to people discovering who I am, so I won't mention which ethnic feature I'm known for.

I definitely bristled a bit at Marshmallow's last sentence. The tone she used to mention my racial feature was the way someone would ask, ""Do you know she became famous for creating *booger sandwich recipes*?""

It's a pretty common racial feature, not some freaky ass fetish.

&gt;""As a makeup artist!"" she honked on, ""I hate it SO! MUCH! When I get people with [that racial feature], I just want to CRY! GURL! It's SOOOOO HARD to fix this! Why don't you just [get a non-essential procedure] to fix it??!! But IGisnotreallife here, actually WORKS it and doesn't she look SO. HAWT???!!! I wish I have her CONFIDENCE to just go out with her [racial feature] without fixing it!!!""

The girls twittered their agreement. I don't know if I'm overly sensitive and getting offended when I shouldn't, or they're so busy sucking up to the point they'd agree to anything. 

I wanted to leave before I did something that may make it into the drama channels, but Marshmallow continued on. 

&gt;""If **I** had [that racial feature] I'd just spend hours [on this makeup technique to ""fix"" it] everyday! I really wish I have YOUR confidence! Like my chubby chipmunk cheeks! It makes me look sooooo fat if I don't contour! I *DEFINITELY* don't have your confidence so I contour it everyday!""

The girls started twittering about how she doesn't look fat, just chubby in a ""cute"" way, ""chipmunk cheeks"" are sooo adorable and totally something they wish they could have because Marshmallow looks soooooooo adorable.

I snapped.

Bitch, if you're going to compare yourself to an animal, it should be a damn bulldog (no offense to the breed, they're actually cute) because your cheeks aren't just chubby, they're *melting*. Melting, Marshmallow. **Melting**. That's how fat they are. 

And this is why I say beauty standards are fucking racist. It's totally ok for people to agree that racial features I'm born with is something so ugly that it's practically heroic of me to not hide them, while calling someone fat is soooo unaccaptable that people have to bend over backwards to redefine it as ""cute""? What the hell.

I know I shouldn't have, and it's a totally bitch move, but I just snapped big time.

&gt;""Oh my gawd, Marshmallow!"" I gushed in the same saccharine sweet tone she was using, ""You're just the *sweetest*! This girl! This girl here is the most *talented* makeup artist EVER! If I have your chubby cheeks, I think I'd just give up and cry! I wouldn't know how to fix it! You have some mad contouring skills!""

I can see people were nervously trying to figure out if I was deliberately being insulting, and I know this is where I should stop, but I couldn't. 

&gt;""Luckily, there's so many ways to fix that easily nowadays!"" 

&gt;At the idea of a quick fix solution, Marshmallow perked up, ""Oh yeah? Like what?""

&gt;""Lipo &amp; weight loss surgery!""

One of the girls asked me what weight loss surgery was.

&gt;""Oh, it's amazing. They just reduce the size of your stomach so you don't *eat so much*! The chipmunk cheeks melts off so easily after that!"" I replied breezily.

There was definitely a horrified gasp or two after this. I know I crossed a line, and I made some excuse to ditch the damn annoying group. 

I've been missing for a few months just to make sure there's no drama on social media that can link this account to me, but it I think it's safe now and no one publicized it. And yes, I know lipo &amp; weight loss surgery aren't quick fix solutions to being overweight, it's just that people seem to think diet and exercise is much harder.

fatpeoplestories,"Hi, first time posting here. 


For backstory, my boyfriend works at a fast food place and frequently complains about this group of hams that come in and order enough to feed a small country. To make things worse, they smell. Bad. I always assumed he meant the usual sweaty hotdog water smell. Boy was I wrong. 

So last night I went to visit him at work, and as soon as I walked through the doors I was knocked back by a horrible odor. 

I went to sit down and wait for my boyfriend to take his lunch and I was sitting in eyesight of the kitchen so he could see I was there. The whole time there was a horrible odor, and on top of that the smell of farts kept wafting over. It was so bad my eyes were watering and I started to gag. I had to get up and go outside at one point.

The only other people in the restaurant were sitting relatively close by and they were... very large. I realized they were the stinky people my boyfriend was telling me about and when he got off for lunch he confirmed it. Apparently they’ve been there since 2pm and it was now 8pm. He said they always just eat then sit for a while then eat some more. 

They smelled like some poor creature got stuck between their rolls and perished. It was so foul a guy that walked in immediately turned around and left. 

I ate on the other side of the restaurant and could still smell them.

fatpeoplestories,"So there's a dude i work with... Let's call him M. 

&amp;#x200B;

M is without a doubt the most insufferable prick i have every met. I really try to see the good in people... But this guy. He's 48 years old, acts like a selfish child 99% of the time, and projects every insecurity he has onto other people. He also can't do anything for himself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just a quick story about him today, but there will certainly be more to follow. There's a lovely, sweet girl who works in our office, and she bought the whole team an advent calendar each. M opened every door, and ate every chocolate in one sitting. He then proceeded to shame other colleagues for being fat... I hate him, not because he's fat, but because of who he is. ",Office Ham
fatpeoplestories,"Hi FPS, Red here. There were two hammenstances within the space of this morning, and I thought ya'll would enjoy them. They are secondhand stories.

My cubemate (J) and I are the office ""candy bitches"". We always have baked goods, candy, or snacky snacks on the island between us, and the office loves it. It's mostly out of pocket, but sometimes we get contributions. Sometimes people jokingly complain about the variety - ""What, only Jolly Ranchers this week? Where's the chocolate?"" and we tease back and tell them we ate it all ourselves. 

This week, I wanted to get some citrus in my diet, so I bought a bag of Cuties (mandarin oranges). I planned to eat 2 every morning so I set those aside, but the rest I cheekily put inside an empty RedVines bucket and set them out for anyone who wanted one. I did this in place of candy this week. 

Ginny was apparently the first to notice, and immediately complained to J.

&gt;Where's the candy?

&gt;Oh, Red got oranges this time. There will probably be candy next week, though.

&gt;Nobody wants oranges. You should be more considerate.

&gt;Some people like healthy choices. And we do this out of pocket, so maybe if you contributed towards the candy fund we could take your requests into consideration.

J gives no fucks. Ginny left in a huff.

I explained in an earlier post that the holidays bring lots of vendor goodies. One of our biggest plumbing vendors hosted a lunch for the office today: Italian food, with all the fixings. I did not partake (I'm addicted to these delicious veggie bowls I found at the grocery store) but my old department supervisor (Laura), who was witness to the uncomfortable cake situation with Sarah, came by and whispered loudly that Ginny had taken two heaping plates, one of spaghetti, and one of fettucine alfredo, back to her desk before coming back and taking two more plates, one piled with garlic bread and one piled with cookies. Apparently the Division President noticed and half-joked that she must be ""exceptionally hungry today"". Laura said that Ginny had just hurried away mumbling. When she left, the DP had looked at Head of HR and said, ""Kind of her to leave the entire salad behind for the rest of us."" 

**TL;DR**: I didn't see the movie but I'm obsessed with *The Greatest Showman* soundtrack and I'm sorry to anyone who walks into the downstairs bathroom mid-warble, but the acoustics are great in there.","HR Ham, a Double Helping"
fatpeoplestories,"This is not the first time I've posted a story about my Ham Universe filled with Ham Planets I call my extended family.  This story involves my son (20).

We've had some family difficulties and since I live 375 miles away, my extended fam rarely gets to see all of us.  We went to visit the fam for my dad's 80th birthday.  The reason my son could make it is because he broke his hand three days ago and he couldn't work (or do anything) over the weekend, so he came with me to the party.  He broke it over-inflating a 10"" tire, which exploded the hubcap into his hand.  He will have hand surgery tomorrow.

Some back ground, the men in my family are all over 6' tall.  I even have twin cousins who were born prematurely that are  now both 6'9"".  Women who are 6' tall, etc.  My son has grown 3 inches since he graduated and I swear, every time I see him, he's even taller.  

Son is currently 6'5"", eats healthy and double for every meal just to keep the skin on his bones.  IDK what he weighs, but he is clearly under weight, barely able to keep up with the calories required to keep up with his still-growing body.

We got there first.  I helped with the plethora of fat-infused side dishes while my sister fried the turkey outside.  (Side note:  My job was to make the salad.  When it came to left overs, the salad looked untouched while the sides were wiped clean.  There was no turkey left, of course, because YUM!)  When my haunt (ham-aunt) got there, my son was seated in the recliner with his hand elevated, bandaged, above his head.

My haunt says, ""Hey, (to my son)!  I haven't seen you in over a year!  Oh my God!  Don't you eat?""

Son - ""Um...yeah.""

Haunt:  ""Like seriously.  Why are you so frickin' skinny?!""

Son:  ""I don't know, I'm probably still growing.  I kinda thought it would be more appropriate if you first ask me how I'm doing with my broken hand.""

And right there, the focus was more appropriately on his recent injury and all the conversation that ensues about cause/repair, etc.

I later told my son that he did a nice job being respectfully direct.",The skinny shaming stopped after this one response...
fatpeoplestories,"Several years ago a new Star Trek movie was coming out. I had scored two passes to see it, but for some reason I was having transportation issues that weekend and wouldn't be able to go. My husband was out of town and my friends were either busy or not interested in Star Trek, and I didn't know who else to give the tickets to.   Carnie had told me at some point before this that she didn't like science fiction and proudly didn't know the difference between Star Trek and Star Wars, so it never occurred to me to offer them to her. Yet the day or so before the movie, she had called and I mentioned the movie passes.  I suppose I made a joke about how I couldn't even give away Star Trek tickets, and suddenly, she was all, ""Free movie? YES PLEASE!""

I was surprised and said something like, ""Wow, Carnie, I didn't think you liked Star Trek or any Sci-Fi movies."" She replied about how much she just loved going to the movies and really wanted to go, so I told her great, she could have the tickets and enjoy the show! At least the passes weren't going to waste! Alls well that ends well, right? Well, no. That's where it turned into a typical Carnie story.

*Carnie: ""What? Aren't you coming?!""*  
**Me:** ""No, I can't make it, Carnie. That's why I'm giving away the tickets. My car is in the shop (or whatever) so go ahead and enjoy the movie. Go with your husband. Enjoy!""  
*Carnie: ""Harry has to work! I don't have anyone else to go with! I can't go ALONE!""*  
**Me:** ""I just told you, I can't make it, my car isn't working. But you can go alone, or ask a coworker. Just let me know how the movie is.""  
*Carnie: ""It's too LATE to ask anyone else. Why can't you just come with me? I wouldn't want to go by myself! Just please, come with me!""*

And that wouldn't have been a problem (I didn't totally hate her yet at this point) except my transportation issues. I don't I don't think Uber was really a thing then, and there isn't bus service, and cabs were more trouble than they were worth due to unpredictability. If she really, really wanted me to go, she'd have to drive all the way to my side of town, pick me up, drive halfway back to the other side of town where the theater was, and then drive me home afterwards. Not a terrible solution, but since she was always broke and low on gas, so I didn't feel right even suggesting she should pick me up. But it turns out she *really* wanted to see a free movie (*any* movie it seems), so she offered to pick me up. I said okay and offered to buy the popcorn and soda to make up for her trouble.

Then it was movie day. I waited for her to show up, and eventually called her to find out if she'd forgotten. When she answered, she told me yes, she still wanted to go, but in her whiney voice, explained she'd had important stuff to do before she could go! She'd had to go get herself some lunch and *now* she had to go walk her dogs. She said she would come get me when she was done, and that she still really wanted to see the movie. ""You realize the movie starts in like 15 minutes, right?"" I asked, thinking about how she drives the way she walks: slow as shit. Yeah, she knew what time it was, but she HAD to walk her DOGS first! DUH. Movie start times be damned!

Call me crazy… I guess I was thinking she'd eat lunch and walk her dogs, you know, like **an hour ago**.

Well, never mind that kind of logic.  I told her maybe we should skip it, it was getting too late, but she didn't want to. She eventually showed up at my door. I again suggested skipping it; the movie had already started by then, and suggested we just watch a DVD  or pay-per-view instead. But in spite of the fact she had been in absolutely no hurry to get there on time, she was still super excited to see a free movie in the theater (and free popcorn and soda too!) and still wanted to go and couldn’t possibly go alone.  Reluctantly I agreed to go.  I scooped all the garbage out of the front seat of the car so I had a place to sit, and we drove off. When we got there, they'd already given away our seats and the passes weren't good for a future show so we missed out. It wasn't that big of a deal, but I guess I was a little disappointed that I put any faith in her and that she dicked around and made us late. I'd wasted a chunk of my day on this crap, and I was miffed.

We left the movie theater disappointed and she drove me home.  Along the way, she made some noise insinuating she was hoping for some gas money, since, you know, she'd wasted all her gas on coming to get me and drive me back for this free movie that never was. Internally I was screaming: But, Carnie, you OFFERED to pick me up! I gave you multiple outs. If you didn't have gas money, you should have said that up front or just not offered to come get me. And anyway, your shitty planning that made us miss out! Don't dump this on me!

But that's okay. I paid for her gas, money which I suspect she spent buying herself a second lunch on the way home to make up for the disappointment of missing out on free movie, popcorn and soda.

I tell you that story to tell you this one:

Sometime after that, my husband found out they were taping some new game show about an hour away from where we live, and they were looking for audience members for the taping. He went online to print out two free tickets for us to be in the audience just for the experience of watching how things go down behind the scenes. (The game show ultimately aired on TV for a season or two, but it wasn’t all that well known or that good.) I thought the whole thing was silly, but I was humoring my husband and agreed to go.

During this time period, Carnie was calling me about once a week or so, to whine and complain and, I kinda suspected, possibly fishing for invitations to come over to hang out. This was after I'd stopped taping her TV show for her, but we'd  occasionally have a ""movie night"" where she'd come over to my house and we'd watch a couple of movies when our husbands were doing other things.

So during one of her weekly phone calls, I made the mistake of mentioning the game show tickets to Carnie, laughing about how silly it was. Again, she surprised me by really wanting to go to something I wouldn't have thought she'd be interested in. I joked, ""Oh sure, you can go with my husband so I don't have to!"" But she was serious, and made whiney noises about wishing she could go with us and how do I keep finding all the free stuff?

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't really want to invite her, and I expected I'd have an easy out:  ""Yeah, but you'll probably have to work that day,"" I said (as she always whined about working TWO JOBS as if she worked more hours a week than any other human ever has). But she said, ""Oh no! I'm off that day!""

Oh great.

I guess I was a little too ""Minnesota Nice"" to flat out tell her no. So even though something told me I would absolutely come to regret this, but I went online, printed an extra ticket for her and told her she could ride with us. She was ecstatic. ""Just know that we have to leave no later than 11am just in case there is bad traffic or we have difficulty finding a place to park."" She said no problem!  I live very close to the freeway entrance that was a straight shot into the city so once she arrived, we'd just head straight out. My husband said, ""If she's not here when we're ready to leave – if she's getting fast food or walking her freakin' dogs -- we're leaving without her."" I wholeheartedly agreed.

I'm the kind of person that if you tell me we're leaving at 11, I'll be there about 10:30 or 10:45,  but not Carnie! At 10:45, I texted her, ""Are you on your way?"" and I heard nothing back. Another ten minutes pass, waiting. We were just getting in the car to leave without her when my phone lit up with a strange number, but it was a local number (and this was before every unknown local number calling you was a spoofed number) so I picked up.

*Carnie: Did you forget me? Didn't you say 11am? You didn't leave without me, did you?*  
**Me:** Carnie, where are you? We're getting ready to leave. Aren't you on your way?  
*Carnie: You said you'd pick me up!*  
**Me:** Wait, I **never** said we were picking you up! Why would we pick you up? Your house is in the wrong direction!  
*Carnie: Well I don't have the gas money to drive to your house! You have to come get me! You said you'd come get me!*  
**Me:** That was never the agreement!!

I was stewing now, but I didn't have time to argue. We hopped in the car and we headed across town to pick her up, bickering amongst ourselves. My husband didn't want to go get her, but had given in.

**Me:** Well, she *did* pick me up that one time, I guess I owe her the favor.  
Husband: Yeah, and she made you pay her gas money, too! Is she going to pay our gas money all the way into the city and back?  
**Me:** Don't hold your breath.

We picked her up and during the ride into the city, I asked her the questions that were burning a hole in my head: why didn't she call me that morning and tell me she didn't have the gas money and ask me to pick her up? Why didn't she answer my text message I'd sent her 15 minutes before she called?  Whose number did she call me from, anyway?  I assumed she'd lost or broken her phone or something but it was more of a Carnie answer than that.  Apparently she didn't have the money to pay her phone bill, so her cell phone service was shut off. She managed to find the last payphone in existence to call me.

Okay, whatever. This was still early enough in our relationship that I still had some sympathy for her since they were chronically broke and struggling.

Because I'd allowed some extra time for heavy traffic, detours or getting lost, we got where we were going without running late. We found parking, but it was several blocks away from the studio and there was some construction going on, so we had a little bit of a hike and some of it was slightly rough terrain, nothing too bad, but it wasn’t all smooth sidewalk, at one point we had to go up some stairs. I wanted to walk quickly to get there to make sure we got in line to get good seats, but Carnie was whining the whole time. *""I can't walk as fast as you guys! Be careful, I might trip and fall! I don't have good balance like you do. It's hard for me to climb stairs. Don't leave me behind!""*

I really wanted to leave her behind, but we slowed our pace to accommodate her. When we got there, she was all out of breath and I couldn't even hold back my eye rolling.

The taping went well, it was somewhat funny, but it went fairly long, at least two hours for a half-hour show, maybe a little longer. When we were done, since we were already in the city, my husband wanted to stop a couple of places before heading home, places in the city that we don't normally get to. I thought Carnie might appreciate it too, since she never got into the city. He pulled into the parking lot of the first stop.

*Carnie: What are you DOING? We have to GO! I work today and you're gonna make me late for my job!! I have to be there in, like, an hour!*

(it's an hour's drive back home so she's already running late)

**Me:** Wait. You told me you had today off!  
*Carnie: Well, I picked up a shift! I need the money to pay my phone bill!*  
**Me:** Then maybe you shouldn't have come!!  
*Carnie: I didn't KNOW it was going to last this long!!*  
**Me:** (mentally beating my head against a wall)

I didn't understand what was going on in her head. If she knew the time was going to be tight, she should have stayed home! She didn't even seem to feel bad treating us like we were nothing more than her free chauffeur service, telling us to cut our own plans short for her convenience! The least she could have done was tell us ahead of time so we could have decided if that would work for us, but of course she didn't, because that might have given us the chance to leave her behind!

After that it became a running joke in our home to remind each other, ""Don't Invite Carnie"" (to anything!). It started with my husband saying, ""I got tickets to (some event). Don't invite Carnie!!"" after which we both had a good laugh. But soon it became a running joke about everything:

(While watching a movie trailer) ""That looks good. We should go see it. Don't invite Carnie!""  
""I ordered pizza. Don't invite Carnie!""  
""Valentine's Day is next week. Don't invite Carnie!""  
""I'm going to bed. Don't invite Carnie!""

I really did try for a long time to have compassion for her and her situation but she was always so frustrating. I honestly have no idea how people work with the poor when having to struggle with this kind of dumb and irresponsible mentality. After a while, I had to learn to just detach from it and not try to help her any longer, and give no more advice (since she didn't want it anyway). I had to learn to just sit back and watch the train wreck in motion, and at that point, it got more fun. I got to the point that I almost looked forward to her next phone call simply for the entertainment value.

**The Great Stenchening**

Meet Bestie: my best friend. 6’ gorgeous amazon. Bestie says seeing this all typed up gives her “’Nam flashbacks, but for Smell.” PTSD of the nose, if you will.

Meet her husband, Aussie Clint Eastwood.

Bestie, Clint, and I treat ourselves to a Bert &amp; Ernie show: it’s been sold out for months and the line is around the block to get in. Shortly before doors open, who shows up? The Orca Pod! They‘ve grown so big they’re not wearing goth clothes anymore. Just giant tent-shirts and stretch pants. 

They roll their way to the very front of the line where they have a plant saving a spot for them, bouncing people off their sides like bumper cars. They shove everyone else away and stand right in front of the doors, and say that they can’t stand up for the hours it would have taken to actually arrive early like everyone else. They’re glaring at every skinny chick in sexy clothes they can find. A hot girl in a plaid corset is subjected to loud scorn. They glare venomously at Bestie. No one here is a sex-crazed groupie except the Orcas: this is really the wrong band for that, but the Orcas are jealous anyway. (Why? WHYY?) Ugh. They are the first to waddle inside when doors open. Whatever. 

The Orcas wedge themselves front and center with loud assertions that they deserve to be there because they are REAL fans; but I have friends to save me and we’re waaaay over on Bert’s side of the stage, so all is good. There are lots of other dirty foreigners near us and we meet lovely people from France and Catalonia and Switzerland. Super — let’s have fun. 

Nope. Right as the opening act comes on, we are all shoved around by two of the Tubby Trolls barging their way to the front rail. 

The worst is yet to come.

CokeBeard’s once black tee shirt is grey and frayed and has holes at stress points. I’m convinced it’s the same tent he was wearing when first I encountered him years ago. He is definitely wearing the same hat. He’s concocted a 60-70” long studded belt to hold his cargo shorts up in place of the rope he used to use. But not all the way up: his massive hairy ass-crack is hanging out.

Half way through the opening act, EndocrineDisorder bulldozes his way through to join the two other Trolls and announces he’s late due to difficulty obtaining coke. That’s when it goes from bad to death. As the evening progresses, the hall heats up. As Bert &amp; Ernie take the stage, a Mysterious Aroma begins to rise from the Trolls and space clears around them. 

Folks, I grew up next to a salmon-spawning stream. Every year, for weeks, we were 20 yards from a RIVER OF ROTTING FISH CORPSES STINKING IN THE SUN. My pocket money chore was to move the bloated rotting corpses on the banks back into the river where they could float downstream. Pitch a dead fish, gag, repeat.

Take it from a stench expert: **This Stench was unspeakably [worse](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pass-out.gif).**

EndocrineDisorder and his pals had evolved over the last few years. Ripened. Attained new heights…depths? They may not have bathed since last time I saw them.

Right in front of Bert, women are [covering their noses](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/Shocked.gif).

Everyone is using translation apps and shouting over the music in various languages trying to determine where The Stench is coming from. Dozens of people are shyly sniffing their own armpits and asking other people to sniff them and asking strangers what the fuck is going on and is there some sort of toxic chemical spill? 

No one’s paying attention to Bert. 

The crowd mass-migrates away from Bert’s side of the stage and there is a growing swathe of bare floor surrounding the Trolls, who are lounging on the front rail, bingo wings a-flap, furry asses bared to the breeze. All that queueing and suddenly no one wants to be here. 

 Like all humans with a sense of self-awareness, Bert wonders at first if he’s to blame. His hands are full of guitar. He is making eye contact with everyone he can, shooting the front few rows confused looks.

The French woman we’ve been talking to gags. 

People are going to the beer carts and the snack bar and hanging out in the back of the concert hall. The miasma is getting worse by the minute: a sickening stew of foot fungus, swamp ass, moldy folds, some of the most pungent and acrid body odors I have ever smelled, and stale beer spills. 

Bert gets a face full of rising hot air and fumes. Oh. OH! He knows what’s up now and wanders upstage to get away.

Ernie ambles over to see what the fuss is and oh, he knows. HE KNOWS. He leaves tout de suite for the other side of the stage where there are a thousand other people he can entertain Stench-free.

Bert does his guitar solo center-stage where it’s safe.

End of first act. Lights off. 

There’s an alcove full of gear hidden by black curtains on Bert’s side of the stage so he can duck in during the show to swap instruments. But now there’s cigarette smoke rising from the curtains. Bert is dug in like a badger, peeping out at us in the dark, insulating himself in a cloud of smoke and laughing his ass off. The laptop glow glittering in his beady little eyes gives him away. 

 Huddled Stench Victims realise he’s laughing at their predicament and provide him with international symbols of Nope. I scratch my nose with my middle finger. More laughs. Oh hello, Karma. I shouldn’t have laughed at Big Bird’s misery in Part II and this is my comeuppance. 
 
Bestie hypothesizes that the Stench is an endocrine disorder because normal B.O. simply isn’t ever this bad. I cover my nose with my scarf. Clint isn’t speaking for fear the Stench particles will get in his mouth. People speculate that the Tubby Trolls are homeless or mentally ill due to the shoving and the disastrous lack of hygiene. Bestie suggests that maybe the Trolls have some sort of cognitive disorder or development delay preventing them from understanding how anti-social and unpleasant they are.

Ernie comes over to assess the sitch and sticks his head out too. He’s not laughing.

The Trolls glance around and see that there’s a demilitarised zone cleared around them. “Where did everyone go?” wonders CokeBeard. EndocrineDisorder, sporting a fedora and a scraggly goatee, shrugs and digs a ridiculously small vial of coke out of his voluminous, filthy pocket. PorkKnuckle berates EndocrineDisorder for bringing so little. They discuss that they’re broke. Ernie has written a song about how much he enjoys coke, and they do ceremonious but very teensy bumps during it.

The show concludes, and a huge group of people has been brought together by a nostril-hair raising ordeal, and we all escape into the fresh air, yay.



**The Conclusion — Ernie Gets Strategic**

Meet my Date. A nice German guy. We’ve been hanging out during the holidays. Date instantly remembered the Tubby Trolls when I brought them up last week.

Off we go to another holiday party. (I know, I *know*, but they’re *so much fun*.) This time I will not be shoved, sweated on, slut shamed, or stunk out. Nope, not me. 

There’s a suspicious lack of entitled Christmas Hams. The stage is adorned with trees and lights, Ernie is roaming freely through the crowd chatting as is his wont, and no one is shoving or stinking. Ah, bliss.

It’s too good to last.

There’s an uproar on the far side of the floor and it’s PorkKnuckle! He’s very late to the party and is trying to push to the front with little success. CokeBeard arrives even later. He’s grown, if that’s even possible. I don’t know how he fits onto public transportation anymore. 

Secret Santa surprise: EndocrineDisorder is nowhere to be smelled! 

House lights are up and Bert comes out. He recognises familiar faces and survivors of the Great Stenchening. We all watch the Trolls to see where they stand for the show. Bert smokes a cigarette in defiance of local law and observes that I have brought my own bouncer. He smirks at us.

They’ve gotten downright strategic: the usual bottles of Vodka are passed straight from the stage to our side of the crowd, far from the Trolls, where they make their way along with everyone politely taking turns. 

Ernie hauls out a burlap sack full of dead-stock merch, toys, and fruit he stole from the green room: he makes ‘sack’ puns and merrily flings gifts into the crowd everywhere except at the Trolls. No matter how much trampling they do, nothing gets close enough for them to catch. He hands bananas to a couple of hot women: “Don’t squeeze it too hard!” and “Be gentle when you peel that!” Oh, Ernie, you dirty old fart.

BUT WAIT, WAIT, CokeBeard STILL hasn’t fully learned his lesson about demanding free stuff! He yells that he wants something too! JFC, CokeBeard. He’s so loud we can hear him all the way across the crowd. 

Bert saunters over to stand right next to Ernie so he can stare CokeBeard down. **Ernie sifts deliberately through his sack and throws CokeBeard an apple.** Bert &amp; Ernie are visibly pleased with themselves.

CokeBeard bellows that he doesn’t like apples. Colour me shocked.

Oh, well, would CokeBeard like one of Ernie’s bananas instead? Bert is grinning like fuckin’ Pennywise. The club is tiny, the mic is live, and even the balcony has hushed. All 600 people can hear this exchange. Everyone waits for a retort. 

No, no, CokeBeard has decided he’s fine with the apple. 

Bert &amp; Ernie trade matching, sharky grins and the show goes on. A lovely time is had by all and **at last the Trolls are silent and well-behaved for the rest of the night.** 

It’s a goddamn Christmas Miracle.

Me: “He was probably enjoying the fresh air.”

The End. ",Bert &amp; Ernie and the Three Tubby Trolls: The Great Stenchening Part III
fatpeoplestories,"Greetings, FPS. First time poster here, deciding to recount a very... special time of my life. Both as a means of processing and moving on from it, as well as laughing my ass off about it because MAN, was it some fat logic bullshit.

So, be me: 5’4” F and ~130lbs. Have always tried to eat healthy, not in shape but enjoys being moderately active. Nowadays, a year after cutting contact with the ham, I am working on running!

Don’t be: my ex girlfriend. Let’s call her “Veronica”. 5’2” and +200lbs, I was never entirely certain of her weight because she’d kind of conceal it from me/exaggerate her weight fluctuations.

Now, I wouldn’t say Veronica was necessarily a Ham Planet. You have to be a special kind of obese for that. She was, and surely is, very much at risk of that if she continues down the road she’s on, especially considering her parents are both obese as well. But in terms of personality? She’s the hammiest person I’ve ever fucking known.

Now, I dated Veronica for 5 years. You heard me, 5 friggen years. 15 to 20 years old. And I didn’t even enjoy most of it, it was just during the immature teen and young adult years of my life where I put up with bullshit due to immature stupidity. This bullshit came in the form of a plethora of health issues. 

When I first met her, Veronica allegedly was suffering from some unknown health issues. Some unexplained pain, this and that, nothing believed to be that major. She told me a month after we meet, a bit after we start dating, that she had a vitamin D deficiency and that’s it. 

But no. Things don’t end there.

Somehow over time, she developed:

- Constant joint pain
- Constant back pain
- Stomach and bowel issues
- Constant headaches
- Constant chest pains

There may have been more, can’t remember. Not to even touch upon the mental health issues that were exacerbated by her own lack of self discipline.

All this shit that, no matter what, no doctor could seem to treat her for! She would see doctor after doctor, yet all of them claimed there was nothing wrong with her. Over time, Veronica began to claim doctors were incompetent and didn’t actually want to help her, because none of them could. Then she became convinced she had any number of different chronic illnesses (her favorite one to lie and say she had was Lupus), that doctors would just refuse to diagnose her with. 

Hmmmm. A sane person might have thought perhaps this was bullshit, and maybe something in her lifestyle was to blame. But I was all wrapped up in her bullshit and always jumped to her defense and rescue whenever anyone tried to criticize her choices. Now, I felt too bad for her being constantly in agony (or so she acted like she was) to tell her when I thought she was making a poor choice, or to leave her at all. I stuck by her all that time out of sheer guilt and having been manipulated. 

Let me break down what some of her “lifestyle choices” were:

- She never drank water. Ever.
- She was constantly drinking Red Bull (the yellow kind, it was her favorite)
- If we were out of Red Bull, she would throw a fit until I went to the store and got her more.
- She used to literally throw glasses of water I would get her because she was angry and didn’t want it. Like a child.
- Did I mention I would fetch literally every food and beverage for her when we lived together? She hardly had to stand.
- She refused to let me cook healthy meals for her, saying she just didn’t like the way I made food.
- When she did cook herself, it was not often enough and it was usually fried or carbohydrate heavy
- She would go weeks where she would refuse to eat anything but ice cream
- I am completely serious, she would refuse to eat anything but ice cream for weeks
- Ice cream was a staple of her diet, and she would lose her shit when we ran out.
- She said she couldn’t eat most vegetables and fruits because they gave her stomach problems
- She claimed the only things that didn’t hurt her stomach were bread products and dairy products. I cannot make this shit up.
- Her own mother had CELIAC, and she thought her bread intake wasn’t the cause of any of her issues. Okay.
- She would make me eat more than I wanted to eat when we would eat together (which was all the time when I began living with her when we were 18) because she would feel bad if she ate more than me
- She would “starve herself” for most of the day every day and then consume three times her fucking body weight in junk food
- Then she would be upset that she didn’t lose weight even though she ate “nothing”
- We ate fast food 90% the time we lived together because she refused to let me go longer than an hour without paying 100% of my attention to her, and I had no time to get groceries or cook because I was constantly taking care of her like she was a literal child
- She would binge eat entire boxes/containers of store bought sweets by herself, maybe I’d have one or two.
- She stayed up until 3 or 4 in the morning almost every night, sometimes even staying up until the actual morning (like 9 am) and would sleep all day
- She would make me do this with her, and would get angry at me if I fell asleep!!! I was so sleep deprived and miserable the whole time I lived with her.
- She hated going outdoors. She literally hated going outside her house, or a mall, or some other shopping center, so much that even the mention of me wanting to go to a park had her reeling with anger
- She would spend 90% of her day sitting or laying down. Often also playing video games once she got into those. She left the house rarely.
- We only left the house to go to shopping malls/stores/places to buy things. She was also disgustingly materialistic but that’s not the point of this.
- She had AT LEAST one venti green tea Frappuccino (from good old MoonDollars) every day. If not two, or three. That’s 26 ounces of milk and sugar with about 1- 2 tablespoons of matcha. I know, I work at fucking Starbu— I mean. MoonDollars. She claimed this was her attempt at “drinking” her calories because “everything else hurt to eat :(“. 
- She thought she was healthy because she would get it without the four pumps of added sugar and replaced the whole milk with skim. There is still sugar in the matcha powder itself and in the frappuccino “base” that they use to make the drink creamy, all it is is thick sugary syrup.
- She hated eating meat and wanted to be vegetarian... but constantly refused to eat anything else with enough protein to replace what she should have been getting from meat. And would just fill up on more bread/dairy.

There’s honestly so much more, but the years I’ve known her have to be unpacked in therapy, and I’ll remember more as I trudge on through the painful memories. As you can see, this bitch NEVER got a sufficient amount of essential nutrients out of what she ate, she was constantly loaded up on caffeine from fucking energy drinks (I think she would go through withdrawal when we ran out for even a day), never stayed hydrated, had the worst sleep schedule (or lack thereof) I’ve EVER seen in a person... but sure, you actually just have chronic illness that doctors refuse to treat you for and that’s why you feel so shitty 24/7!!!!!!! Yep!!!!!!!! Bitch.

She would refuse to go to the doctors after one suggested that she needed to lose weight. It was a tremendously stressful experience that I, nor anyone else (mostly her mom) was prepared for, because we had to deal with her not letting it go for the next... ever. She never shut up about it for the next three years. Honestly, though, she downward spiraled even more than she already had been after that happened, the doctor calling her fat. 

To finish off my sexy rant time, here are some of her hammiest personality/attitude based habits:

- She would call other people fat, in a negative and critical way, despite being fat herself. Her favorite thing to do when she was upset at someone was to sit there and criticize their appearance at me in private for three hours after whatever stupid thing happened that made whoever it was hurt her feelings.
- She would hoard so many bags of snacks, that she never got through an entire bag before it got stale
- She would say constantly that she wished I was fatter/bigger than her so that she would feel less bad about her own weight
- Sometimes she would ask me to force feed her food, as a fetish, because she wanted me to think her being stuffed like a Christmas pig was sexy. Eugh.
- She would try to convince me to skip work or school (and would often succeed until I got sick of her a month after starting college two years late, because of her) just to stay home and take care of her.
- She would only shower one to two times a week. Just because she claimed it was too much effort.
- She would go to the gym for maybe a week or two before never stepping foot in it again for at least 9 months
- She constantly thought everyone was judging her for her weight
- She would get enraged (and I mean it— her anger was genuinely scary) whenever any girl smaller than her would call herself “thick”. or any girl larger than her. It was all “skinny bitches” or “disgusting whales” and how they either weren’t actually thick because they were too thin or weren’t actually thick because they were just fat.
- She wanted me to draw fan art of all the characters she liked best as fat to make her happy
- She looked down heavily on skinny people. And fat people. And pretty much fucking everyone! Unless she liked you. Until you hurt her feelings. Then she’d talk about you behind your back or just victimize herself for hours about “how could you hurt me like this when all I do is care about you” until you grovel for forgiveness
- She was really, really skilled at coming up with bullshit reasons why she couldn’t drink water/eat vegetables/exercise more/leave the house, in a way that made her seem like a poor victim of circumstance, bad genetics, and a cruel god. She typically fooled people for a bit before they realized she was a bitch and ghosted. I was the only sucker to stick around for that long.

Anyway, the end. Haha, I really am traumatized. Apologies if my post is hard to follow, I don’t have a cohesive story about her right now. This is just everything I can recall about her lard ass right now. If people want to hear more about her, I’ll try to come up with a proper story about one instance during which she was incredibly hammy. And with that, I bid you all adieu.",Hypochondriac Ham Ex Girlfriend Ruined 5 years Of My Life And Left Me Permanently Traumatized
fatpeoplestories,"Took me over a week to get my boiling blood to calm enough to even write this out, but even still I’m so pissed about what happened last Tuesday.

I decided to throw a little “Friendsgiving” dinner on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving as a little get together with about 10 of my friends before we all went home for the holiday. I made the plans to have the dinner weeks in advance, setting up who would be bringing what in a group chat and then personally confirming with everyone individually the week before.

 I was making the mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy, and cranberries all from scratch. Another friend planned on bringing the turkey, another friend was making dessert, etc etc; basically, everyone coming had their own item to contribute. 

Enter HAM BITCH. Ham bitch, a true ham herself, promised me a few weeks before the dinner that she would be bringing the ham (of course! How fitting!). Mind you, I hadn’t been too close with Ham Bitch lately as her attitude had been too bitchy and all she ever wanted to do was go eat fast food which I have been avoiding, but I still needed someone to bring the ham to dinner so I went ahead and invited her under the assumption that she just bring a small ham. You all see where this is going...

Two days before the dinner she confirms via text that she was in fact still bringing the ham. 

The morning of the dinner, while I was cooking, she reiterated that she’ll be by with the ham at 6:30 pm with dinner at 7.

Two minutes before 7, after she was already supposed to be there, she called me and asked me, verbatim, “Do you know where I can get a ham?”  I lost it. You can get a ham at any of the several groceries in our big city, and there were still plenty when I went shopping for some forgotten mushrooms that morning! Are you kidding me?! The ham needs to bake for at least 30 minutes before it’s served and I would’ve bought one myself had I known! She then decided to “just bring Mac n cheese instead” and hung up. 

An hour after everyone else had already started eating, Ham Bitch called again asking to bring a friend to dinner. At this point, the copious wine I had been drinking to forget about that sweet sweet missing ham was settling into my system, so I told her whatever, since she says she’s still bringing something after all.

Finally, Ham Bitch shows up with a hammy friend in tow, and no Mac n cheese but instead two cans of pillsbury cinnamon rolls probably from the back of her fridge. Ham bitch and her ham bitch friend proceed to use my pans to bake one can of cinnamon rolls, EAT THE ENTIRE 5 CINNAMON ROLLS THEMSELVES, wipe out the rest of my potatoes and stuffing, finish the rest of the sodas, and clean out my turkey to the bone. It looked like vultures had attacked it, which wasn’t too far from the truth. Then, they sat in a corner by themselves being big ol bitches the whole night, doing nothing but eating everything, making fun of some slightly different guests I had there and snickering in the kitchen about everyone else at dinner. When Ham Bitch, her ham bitch friend, and their double chins finally left, she took the unopened can of cinnamon rolls with her but left the pans and plates they used for me to clean up after. They also didn’t bother to thank me or my fiancé who was hosting the dinner. The fact that everyone else was so helpful, polite, and friendly made her behavior stand out as unacceptable even more, and I ended up seething after she left when other people commented on her actions. 

I was so mad. I still am. She is forever known as Ham Bitch from here on out to everyone else who was there.

WHERES MY FUCKING HAM BITCH?! 


",The ham forgot the damn ham!!!
fatpeoplestories,"I moved into my apartment two years ago,when I did the neighbors upstairs were an elderly couple. Nicest people ever, never had issues with them they brought me over muffins when I moved in. 
9 months ago sadly the gentleman suffered a stroke he pulled through but they decided to move into a long term facility. A month after that I came home my SO in tow to see a moving truck. 

The moving truck was completely low to the ground until they got out. He was wearing a fedora had the typical neck beard and is at least 400 pounds. She looked like a sausage in a casing, she’s got to be about 280 pounds and was wearing way to tight of clothes.  I was polite and said hello, my SO and I offered to help them. He told us his company relocated them here and were sending people to move them in. So we shrugged and went inside my place. All of a sudden my walls rattled and I shit you not a photo slid off the wall. It sounded like a stampede of angry elephants. 

Besides the noise they made I was ok with them until the rib situation. So I have a smoker, I participate in the bbq circuit. One day I had my smoker going in my side of the yard. We each have our own little yards that are fenced in. Anyway my SO was in the house reading a book and I was fussing in my garden when I decided to head to Lowe’s for something. I had three racks of ribs in the smoker. As I’m leaving I see neighbors coming out of his truck. He sniffs and says wow that smells good. I tell him I’m smoking ribs, make some small talk I leave and run my errands. I come back and go into the house, my SO is napping on the couch. So I join her and am just dozing when I swear I hear my fence open. I chock it up to nothing and I fall asleep. 

When I wake I go out to check on the smoker, and I’m horrified to see there’s only one rack of ribs in my smoker. I’m fuming I go in and tell SO and then I remember the neighbors. I knock on their door and she answers she’s blocking the doorway with her extensive girth but she’s acting like she doesn’t want me near her door. 
I as her if she saw anyone running off with my ribs. She shakes her massive head and tells me “no we didn’t but ribs sounded good so my husband just went to Walmart to get some.”

So I go back down into my apartment pretty sure they stole my ribs. However I couldn’t prove it so I just begrudgingly accepted it 

However since then I’ve had other food taken from my smoker and its to the point we installed cameras. They also took a dozen cupcakes my SO had on her car. She baked some to take to work and set them on her car, she forgot her keys and ran back in. When she came out her cupcakes were gone. Mrs. Hambones car that had just been there was missing. We did call the cops on that. However Mrs Hambone claimed SO had the cupcakes on her car and she figured they were from her. 

It’s not just us though, our complex does party  in the clubhouse. Every party someone throws there food goes missing. Our most recent party we had put the food in the clubhouse the night before. The day off 2 packs of hotdogs, a tub of Mac salad, a tray of deviled eggs and a carton of vanilla ice cream went missing. Every one knew it was them. One of our neighbors got into a confrontation with them. It’s to the point where people are out right hostile to them. They supposedly just bought a home so I guess I won’t have to deal with them much longer.",My neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Ham
fatpeoplestories,"I went out to dinner with a friend and a couple I never met before.  Super nice people.  Wife was a moderate ham.  My friend mentioned the length of my arms while we were talking about coats.  I said I'm hard to fit because of my arms.

Anyway, the ham says, ""So you're an exercise instructor!  Is that how you stay so skinny?  Just spend your entire life exercising?""  

I said, ""Well, it has a lot more to do with portion size and diet.  But the length of my arms and legs makes me appear too skinny.  I mean, even when I was pregnant, my legs and arms still looked skinny because of their length.""

""Oh!  So it's genetic!"" She said as her giant plate of pork chops arrived at the same time the waiter laid down my large salad.

I felt like a jerk, but I said, ""It has a lot to do with my regular diet.""

She didn't even hear me because she already had 4 forkfuls in her mouth.  Nom nomnom.

At the end of the very pleasant dinner, I got a box to take home the rest of my salad.  She looked at my plate (which had 1/2 the salad left) and she looked at her plate (which was wiped clean as even the juices were absorbed by her bread that she ate).  I think she got a realistic view of how skinny people are vs how hams are.

It's not like I was dieting.  Or acting/putting on a shame-show.

It's just how I am.  I had eaten Saganaki cheese for an appetizer.  I was pretty stuffed.  I knew that was the bulk of the dinner's calories and without thinking, I fancied a salad for dinner.

Plain and simple.  That's it.

It's not genetics.  If it was, my own mother wouldn't be using the electric cart at the grocery store.",Oh! So it's genetic! nom nomnom
fatpeoplestories,"Today I was grabbing an umbrella at the 7-11, because like an idiot I forgot mine, and witnessed a truly amazing display of disordered eating from a beyond rotund fellow.  The sort whose FUPA grotesquely extends over and beyond their belt buckle like an apron of necrotic flesh.

He was ordering a Bahama Mama sausage from the cashier, breathless and huffing from the monumental walk from his handicapped parking lot to the register, full soda coke in hand, and a full giant sized bag of Cheetos.

The clerk got him his rancid pork torpedo, but in handing it over, the clamshell it was in tipped, spilling the hotdog to the floor.  This upset Henry the Huge to the point of hysterics.  He demanded another, but the 7-11 owner said that was the only one on the rollers and it would take a while to defrost and cook another.

Hysterical Henry proceeded to pick the hot dog off the dirty floor (muddy from boots and the rain) look at it sadly, then proceed to eat it while fishing for his wallet with his other hand.

fatpeoplestories,"Our state is an interesting place. You can find all sorts of interesting occurrences. Some defy logic, for example how can one spend so much time and money repairing the Metro and actually have quality decrease while the prices go up?
 
 This is not so much about a Defiance of logic as a root attempt to defy gravity and Newtonian physics. Once Upon a Time I used to frequent the grand Wheaton Park a couple times a year, usually on a friend's kids birthday

Wheaton Regional Park Adventure Playground  is the business and it pretty much has it all. 


 This was the kind of parks that I wish would have existed when I was a kid. Everything is super eco-friendly and imaginative and safe, and there is a comforting, noticeable absence of homeless alcoholics urinating on Park equipment in broad daylight.  This place is is as welcoming and wholesome as you can get. With the exception of a few moms that are slipping vodka into their water bottles and some of the visitors from other counties and locales people generally behave in a Montgomery County kind of way. I mean the part of Montgomery County that's nice, like out near Snowden River Parkway.
 
 On a particular Sunday in which the fall Breeze was quite crispy and I found myself at one of these parties. One of my good friends  kid was about 4 and he was really interested in climbing onto the large slides and long tube slides you find in this park.
 
 Close to the middle of the area we were all hanging out near there is a big mountain made of rubber for lack of better explanation cyst giant Hill like thing. My friend and I like climbing on to it with his kid because it is probably the closest we will ever get to actually climbing Mount Everest.

As we carried our middle aged hides up the hill with my friend's four-year-old blazing the way ahead we noticed there was something at the top of the hill that resembled a second larger knob on top of the knob of the Hill. This thing had what could best be described as a top If You took a shower curtain and lashed it on 2 the side of a obese grizzly bear in a crude fashion. It's entire back was exposed to us mountains upon mountains of flaps and Folds and a liberal amount of back hair betraying it's likely Greektown Origins. It had hair red like the fires of hell and a tattoo of Betty Boop that had seen better days.

It's hair was pulled into a high braided ponytail that exposed an entire pack of Hebrew National Franks writing down from its kitchen to the hump of fat upon which Betty Boop had been crudely imprisoned. 

I noticed that it set aside the skinniest African man I had ever seen who has the biggest grin I think I've seen someone display when sitting beside an object that could cast a shadow large enough to obscure a Ford Aerostar. He held and iPod and they each have one of the earpieces in their ear. She had a really ludicrously sized bottle similar to the one people drink Health shakes out of that was filled with what I thought was coke.
 
 I don't know much about alcohol mixtures but I figure that if I can smell the contents of your cup about four to five feet away you are probably three sheets to the wind.
 
 I could not for the life of me imagine why someone would want to get trashed at a place like this. There are children there are adults there are cell phone cameras and not too far away there's that Mormon space temple. Nonetheless this enormous burden upon the surface tension of the giant rubber Hill sat there giggling with her friend listening to music and periodically taking swigs from whatever that concoction she was drinking was.

My buddy and I spoke quietly amongst ourselves trying to figure out how exactly this object had come to rest upon this hell for certain if it not come up on its own volition or power. After all this is more than just a gentle slope. Apparently alcohol can cause incredible things to happen. My buddy being a sciency guy mention that she defied gravity. I have been clearly gone to college only to escape parental supervision don't know enough about gravity to agree with him but I know that what come up must eventually come down. His son was pretty happy to play up there for a good while. 

We were more than happy to watch as this odd coupling that could only occur in the Wiles of PG County Maryland was beautifully at home in a park in a state that was slapped into submission by the Union and still had a lot of its own issues to work out. It was a beautiful thing.

Or so we thought. Apparently something came on the iPod that made the large women yell out shrilly OMG that's my song! She attempted to rise from her haunches but it clearly had a lot to drink and she put her hands down steady herself. The guy I guess decided he was going to dance on her. On her or around her, anyway.

 Unfortunately he bumped into her as she was off center and tipped her. She fell and rolled. This was not the kind of fall that is quickly arrested.
 
 She initially tucked her head and did what can be described as a tumble maybe a vestigial response from her cheerleading days of yore upon coming out of the first roll however she seem to try to correct her path and kind of flopped diagonally before rolling two to three more times towards the bottom of this big blue rubber hill.

When the impressive bulk of this person was finally arrested by the honest earth,  inertia tugged her choicest humps and bumps in the direction she had been going. They then jiggle slightly and came to a halt. My friend a much more athletic and caring person than I, rushed down the hill shouting ma'am ma'am are you okay?  

I tried to make myself useful by making sure the kid wasn't too freaked out. Who am I kidding he was laughing and said she went boom. She was actually okay and took it with Incredible Grace.

She was helped back onto her feet partly by my friend myself and her very thin significant other, and was capable of walking away on her own power. I was glad she was not hurt.  
 
 We left shortly thereafter and on our way back to his house his son was chattering on and on about how she was like Humpty Dumpty. I mean it's not mean-spirited given his relatively young age, when we got back to his house my friend started telling his wife about the situation but his son insisted on telling the story with appropriate sound effects and all. She was at least a little appalled by the gusto with which this four year old kid was describing this fall and soon enough she decided that it was time for junior to wash up, leaving my buddy and I and the living room. 

We grabbed a couple beers and sat there talking about how great it was at that Park is available for his kid to play on and how much the area directly around his house had become less child-friendly. After a few more beers we somehow got into discussing the mechanics of that fall we witnessed. I still was not entirely certain how she got up there  given that she was intoxicated  and her impressive size .

 Sufficiently inebriated to loosen his tongue, my friend said in a rather thick Indian accent that's what she gets for disrespecting Isaac Newton and his laws.

fatpeoplestories,"Here's a grand tail for all of you holiday hams.
 Every once in awhile around the holiday season Costco has a lovely set up where you can sample various cheesecake flavors.
 
 This occurs at least in the Costco near me usually around the holiday season.
 On this particular holiday season in the third year of Our Lord Barry I went to the local Costco to pick up absurd amounts of pretzels and mustard because that is the best snack ever.
 
 I decided to stop by a lovely cheese cake display area and partake in the incredible awesomeness that is free cheesecake samples. In front of me it was an older woman who had two girls with her. These two girls look like they grew up on the wrong side of Hagerstown and by that I mean the side that is boarded in with cattle fences.
 
 The older woman was in line to purchase an actual cheesecake already knowing the kind she wanted, I was in there for the sample as it seemed where the two women / girls.
 
 Both of these young ladies we're about five foot two and 230 and had the kind of facial complexion that made you think they suffer through a gas attack at y p r e s. 

When the older woman grabbed one of the cheesecakes the two girls took samples. They did this two or three times before the older woman told them but they were moving on. At this moment they both grabbed for what appeared to be the same sample. I don't know if some sort of animal Instinct took over but they engaged in the kind of angry growl fighting you'd expect out of two dogs that have latched onto the same bone.


 Nothing really all that terrifying yet however neither would let go and then it turned into a short shoving match followed by what has to be the most perfect depiction of an Olympic suplex I've ever seen since ending my high school and college wrestling career. 

Thing one pulled Thing 2 in clothes wrapping her arms around or massive upper body and then like Willie at the end of Free Willy did this weird breaching backwards jump maneuver that's sufficiently unbalanced her friend to cause her to fall over essentially in a diagonal direction away from the aggressor.

 They both hit the ground maybe about 2 seconds apart as the thrown woman stayed on her feet for longer than the one who attempted to send her friend to suplex City. The sound was that sound you hear when you hit someone in the back with a rowing oar after you covered them liberally in motor oil. 

I didn't hear the thud you would expect from the sound of bone and muscle striking the floor would rather I kind of wet pop that happens when you smack your hands together while they're copped after you wet them. The old lady started screaming and yelling and the two younger women pick themselves off the floor with a frightening alacrity that I would a tribute to vampires or crackheads in South Florida then they walked out towards the line area. Those of us in line for samples just stared at each other. The truly terrifying part was the Soulless stare o the person cutting the samples I'm assuming because she had been there before.
 
 Unfortunately the spot where the women crashed upon the Costco floor was slightly wet and required one of those Slippery When Wet signs.

fatpeoplestories,"Hi FPS, Red here - again. Ginny just pulled another hammy stunt.

There's a chain sandwich shop down the street, rhymes with Shimmy Shohn's. They've just opened this location and apparently they dropped off some miniature versions of their sandwiches to promote themselves. I walked into the kitchen to pour some tea as they put two trays down, stacked high with mini sandwiches. I'd say 25 sandwiches to a tray, the sandwiches are 3 inches in length. (I measured with a ruler for science and accuracy.)

I shot a quick text to a few coworkers letting them know tasty goods had arrived, and left for my desk. I ended up forgetting to grab honey for my tea so not two minutes later I walked back to the kitchen, only to run into Ginny walking out with a full tray of sandwiches. 

I looked at her, looked at the sandwiches, and her again, and said, ""Oh, are you passing those out?""

""No, these are for, um, an HR meeting.""

""But they're for everybody...""

""There's enough left.""

I waited about fifteen minutes before making up an excuse to walk past her cube. There are sandwich wrappers *everywhere*. 

I was willing to give her the pass on the potentiality of there actually being an HR meeting, even if it was rude of her to take the sandwiches that were clearly for everybody, but yeah... no. She ate them all.

The holiday season brings lots of vendor gifts to the office. It can be anything from those giant gift baskets to bottles of wine to gourmet cookies and cakes. Usually my coworkers will walk around and offer everyone some of the goods if they're really delicious. 

Today, someone in accounting (""Sarah"") got a box of fresh mini bundt cakes. She was walking down the line of cubes, saying excitedly that these were her favorite kind, and that she couldn't possibly take all of them home so please help yourself. Everyone who wanted one, took one. *One.* Like decent people. Sarah didn't have to share. Sarah could have kept them to herself. But she didn't. Because she's nice.

Ginny came around the corner as Sarah was handing the last few out, keeping back three so she could take them home to her family. Ginny saw the box closing and said, ""WAIT, I WANTED SOME."" 

Sarah turned in surprise and said, ""Oh, I just gave away the last one! I'm sorry.""

""No you didn't! There are three more in there!""

""Well, yes, but I'm saving those for my family. They're our favorite."" Sarah beamed.

Ginny was not happy.

""You can't just give everyone ELSE a cake and LEAVE ME OUT.""

Heads were popping up over cubicles to see what the ruckus was. Sarah looked offended and embarrassed. Josh, the last person to receive a cake, turned and offered Ginny his.

""Here, Ginny. You can have mine, I shouldn't be having this much sugar anyway.""

""Um, no, that's lemon. I want the chocolate ones that she has in the box. This is really unprofessional of you, Sarah - you can't just exclude people.""

Sarah was clearly upset and kind of alarmed. She opened the box and was in the middle of saying, ""You can have the chocolate one if you want."" when Ginny reached in and took *two cakes* - one chocolate, and one lemon. 

""THANK you! Remember next time to share with everyone. It's not fair, you know."" 

She took a HUGE bite of the chocolate cake, and walked away. 

Sarah still looks furious. Josh returned the untouched lemon cake he had offered Ginny to the box, saying he really didn't need it and Sarah ought to take it home. 

The feeling at the moment is pretty awkward... especially because everyone within a ten foot radius witnessed her being so rude.

fatpeoplestories,"After Carnie and I both moved on from working at that hotel, we stayed in touch. I had grown to hate her as a coworker, but now that we didn't have to work together, I thought maybe we'd get along better and I'd have fewer reasons to be annoyed by her. We're related and all that… I was still hopeful at that point we'd be friends. And now we weren't working opposite shifts, we could actually see each other outside of work. How bad could it be?  


When we left off, I'd mentioned I'd never had a meal with Carnie, and this is true. This is because I tend to eat home cooked meals and Carnie ate almost exclusively fast food.  Worse, she apparently ate most of her meals in her car (I always joked to my husband that she never saw a fast food drive-thru she wouldn't break for) as evidenced by the sea of fast food wrappers all over her car. The passenger side floor would be two feet deep with garbage, and more in the back seat. The couple of times I found myself in her car, I had to shovel garbage into the back seat just so I could sit down, as I have this weird rule about not wanting to sit in a garbage heap. Even people who aren't concerned about keeping their car tidy would probably have found this somewhat troubling. What has to be wrong with you to do this? How incredibly lazy do you have to be to just let fast food wrappers pile up like that? Just throw the garbage back into the bag it came in and throw it out when you get to your destination! Or at least do this every few days!! What the hell, Carnie? 

  
And while I know many people, maybe even most people, now eat almost exclusively fast food or take-out, I never understood why these two, who had no money and were developing health issues due to their obesity, were spending all that money on fast food. Carnie and Harry were chronically broke, which means they were always having some financial difficulty or another. (Maybe if they didn't spend their entire paycheck at Taco Bell… but I digress.) 

  
Not that many months after we'd left the hotel, her cable was shut off due to non-payment. She complained to me that she was missing her favorite shows and since one of those was a show I liked to watch, I invited her over to watch it with me. This mistake quickly snowballed into her wanting me to record all her favorite shows (thankfully only about four shows a week). I was still on fairly friendly terms with her at this point, so I didn't mind, at least not in the beginning. At this point I was still thinking of this s a friendship and was being open minded; you put up with the things about your friends that are a little weird because then they'll put up with your weird things. Or so you hope.

  
(This arrangement lasted for a few months until she started piggy-backing on her mother's Netflix and Hulu accounts and thankfully could watch TV at home, much to my relief.)  


By this time, I had started a new job in my career field and my workdays were long. I worked an 8-hour day, Monday-Friday. When you add in the lunch hour on top of that, plus the one hour each way commute into the city, I was out of the house about 11 hours a day. It was also stressful primarily due to the company trying to scrimp on staff, so I'd often come home mentally exhausted for being yelled at about our backlog and thus less tolerant of putting up with someone else's bullshit than I normally would.   
Carnie, meanwhile, had a job as a retail cashier. She got maybe 20 or 25 hours a week there – I know this because she complained about the lack of hours often (yet she'd also complain if they scheduled her for *too* *many* hours during the holiday season). Usually she worked only a four or a six hour shift – apparently if they work more than seven hours, they have to be given a lunch break, so the company was careful never to give them longer shifts.  I think she was getting like maybe three or four days a week, maybe 18-24 hours a week, at a job that was maybe a five or ten minute commute from her house.  She'd also picked up a second job, a one-shift-a-week job at some no-tell motel around the corner from her house. (She was so close she could walk to work. I mean, you know she *didn't,* but she could have.) Between the two jobs, she may have worked 28 hours a week on average, working four days a week, sometimes five, and had a short commute. My point is, it's not wrong to say her life was a little less busy and complicated than mine.    
 

Carnie quickly learned what time I'd be home from work most evenings, so on the days she wanted to watch her shows, she'd pop in ten minutes after I walked in the door. Sometimes she'd even be there before I got home. This was somewhat annoying, but I wasn't going to let it get to me since it was only about once a week, occasionally twice. The way I figured, if she got there early, she would go home earlier and let me have some time to wind down before bed, which was more important to me, so I didn't make a fuss.   


I'd get in the door from that 11-hour day, put my stuff down, go to the bathroom, and then I'd usually head to the kitchen to start cooking dinner. Carnie would show up- having already snarfed down her fast-food on the ride over, would come into the kitchen, sit at the table and watch me cook and complain about her day until she was ready to go watch TV.  
 

One evening, some version of this conversation took place when I was crankier than usual and not wanting to put up with a 40-year-old who I felt was acting like a teenager. I already had one of those to deal with, and I didn't need another.   
 

*Her* *(watching me chop veggies): I don't like vegetables. Tee hee hee.*  
**Me:** What do you mean? Which ones?  
*Her: Any of them. They are yucky.*  
**Me:** What are you, twelve?  
*Her: No! I just don't like vegetables. Not everyone has to like the same thing you know!*  
**Me:** There is such a wide variety of vegetables. How can you not like *any* of them?  
*Her: They are icky. I don't like them.*   
**Me** (sarcastic): Except French fries.  
*Her: Yeah, except French fries. Teee hee hee. And mashed potatoes.*  
**Me:** And ketchup.  
*Her: Yeah, and ketchup. Tee hee hee!*  
 

I still can't understand refusing to eat any and *all* vegetables but I'm a glass is half-full kinda gal… if she'd liked vegetables, she might have wanted to eat dinner at my house those nights, so it was really a blessing in disguise that I didn't have to feed her. The gods were smiling down upon me.  
   
However, then there was this argument, which pushed me over the edge from mildly annoyed to kinda ticked off. Now she really *was* acting like a teenager.  


*Her: Anyway, I wouldn’t even have time to cook!*  
**Me:** Excuse me?  
*Her: Well, I work TWO jobs you know. When would I have time to cook? Tee hee hee.*  
**Me** (a little snide): You certainly have time to sit here in my kitchen watching ME cook, don't you?  
*Her: Well yeah, but that's different! I was starving when I got off from work and I had to eat. And I had to walk my dogs when I got home! I was too hungry to have to take the time to cook!*  
**Me:** You think I wasn't hungry when I got off from work before my one-hour commute home? But I didn't hit the drive-thru window!  
*Her: …*  
**Me:** You realize I am working *full time*, don't you? Yet I still find time to cook breakfast, pack a lunch and cook dinner. So I don't know what you're talking about.  
*Her: I work TWO jobs!*  
**Me:** You work 25-30 hours a week and you have no commute, Carnie!! Between my job and my commute, that's 55 hours a week, about double what you work. But somehow I still find time to cook!  
*Her: Well, when would I have time to go to the grocery store?!*  
**Me:** When do you think I find time to go to the grocery store?! I go on my day off! You could go on *your* day off! Don't play dumb! If you don't want to cook, then don't, but don't you sit here in *my* kitchen saying YOU work so much harder and YOU don't have time to cook, unlike people like ME who you seem to think have oodles more free time than you do!! That's really rude!  
 

She shut up and slunk off to watch her show after that. And because I'm a special brand of crazy, I felt bad that I'd been too hard on her. She wasn't *really* being snotty to me when she said it, but she's so self-centered, she had no perspective for anyone else, or realize she wasn't as big a victim as she liked to pretend she was. The truth is, she's incredibly lazy, and if she'd just admitted it, shown she had some self-awareness, I'd have just laughed it off with her. But she wouldn't admit it, and tried to make excuses and it hit my nerves.  


Still, I tried to sympathize with her and make amends. I learned she owned a crockpot, so I thought, great! and tried giving her crock pot recipes – these could cook while she worked and she didn't have to have a lot of cooking skill and they'd be ready when she got home. That would work, right? Maybe save her money, and time and – call me crazy, maybe give her a feeling of accomplishment and maturity. I also tried giving her my panini maker – you can make hot sandwiches in minutes with it, and again, no cooking skill needed. Both appliances clean up pretty quickly, too, so it's not like a huge mess of dishes like I usually end up with after cooking. 

  
You'll be shocked to hear this, but she wasn't the least bit interested in my help or advice. She didn't take the panini maker, and I doubt she ever made any of the crockpot recipes. She preferred having a pocket full of excuses not to cook. Fine, that's allowed, but I didn't want to listen to her damn excuses anymore. Tell someone who cares. I didn't want to listen to her money woes anymore, either, if she could afford fast food for every meal. I once tried to figure how much it would cost my husband and I to eat fast food for the whole month – and I rather imagine we'd have eaten less per meal than they would – and it blew our monthly food budget out of the water. Even a conservative estimate of $5 per meal per person ads up to a LOT of money, something I could never have afforded in my budget, even with my husband and I having ""good"" jobs and living a middle-class lifestyle.   


On another occasion we had another argument over the cost of foods. Her husband was having health issues and the doctors said no more greasy fast food. She whined that he wouldn't give it up, but then when I suggested healthier foods she could cook, she fell back on the typical Fat Logic excuses.  
 

*Her: When would I even find time to grocery shop?*  
 **Me** (astounded at her stupidity): You literally work at a grocery store!   
 

(The first retail chain she worked at sold some grocery items; the one she later worked at had a full grocery section.)  
 

*Her: Anyway, I am TOO TIRED when I get home from work to cook.*  
 **Me:** Then use the crock pot and set it up before you leave for work. The food is ready when you get home.  
 *Her: Well, I'd never remember to have all the ingredients.*  
 **Me:** That's why you make a list before you go to the store!!  
 *Her: I don't even know what I want to eat until I'm hungry! I can't plan meals in advance if I don't know what I'll want to eat!*

  
**Me:** Then bring home the groceries for whatever you feel like eating that day home from your shift.  
 *Her: I don't want to spend any more time at work than I have to! When I get done with work I want to be gone!*  
 **Me** (snarky): Then maybe you should work at a fast food place so you won't want to eat that crap anymore either!!  
 

How did she *always* manage to sound like a whiny teenager? She was in her 40s for pete's sake, but you wouldn't know it to talk to her.   
   
*Her: But healthy food is EXPENSIVE.*  
 **Me:** Oh don’t give me that shit. Junk food might be cheaper per serving, but you end up eating way more of it, so it really ends up more expensive. When you buy junk food, generally you end up eating twice as much of it, which means you're spending the same amount or more than if you'd just bought the healthy foods.  
 *Her: No, it's still more expensive. I wouldn't eat less of the healthy food! I really like to eat! Tee hee hee!*  
 **Me** (snappish): Maybe you need a new hobby!! Just grow up already! 

  
Admittedly, some of this might be a slight exaggeration – it's been a few years and I don't suppose I remember the conversations exactly – but this is close to how some of our conversations went.  With Carnie, you don't need to exaggerate – she really was comically stupid and annoying.

  
Strangely, even though on several occasions I'd get bitchy with her when she started to whine too much, she'd never stay mad at me; she always turned back up a week or two later. She'd glomed on to me like I was the only person willing to put up with her and she thought I was her best friend.  For a while, I had this naïve idea that maybe she just needed some guidance or advice and wisdom to help fix some of her problems; maybe no one had taught her better, maybe she'd never had a good example in her life. After a while I started to realize she knew better, she was just determined to stick to her guns and do things her way (the lazy way) *no matter what* and I started to hate her. But in the meantime, I kept giving her more chances, thinking I shouldn't be so hard on her – she was, after all, not too bright and seemed like a lost teenager who just needed a mother figure.

fatpeoplestories,"This is based on my own experience, and also, if this doesn't belong in this sub, somebody please let me know! I posted some of this as a comment in someone else's thread, but I wanted to ask about it as its own topic because I'm very curious.
_______________________________________________________

About two years ago, I was a bit larger than I am now (and eating worse) and was experiencing health issues that were caused by my fat ass. First one I learned about was high blood pressure, which seemed to hover around 154/90, something like that. I can't remember if that's pre-hypertension or full-blown hypertension, but I would always blame it on being nervous in the doctor's office. But when it was that number consistently, my doctor threatened to put me on blood pressure meds and also take away my birth control if I didn't get it under control. I knew being fat could cause hypertension, but I would tell myself that it was always normal in spite of my weight, so that couldn't have been the case.

Some months after that, I wound up in the ER because of a suspected lung problem and got a CT of my chest and upper abdominal area. No lung issues at all, but my primary care doctor found that I had a fatty liver after looking at the results herself (they never told me that in the ER). My liver enzymes were elevated too and I could no longer chalk it up to my birth control pill when they were so high (because apparently combo pills can make them go up *a little*).
_______________________________________________________

Know what neither of these doctors ever once said to me? That my weight was the cause of all these problems. Never did they tell me to lose weight or that I was too big. When my primary provider called me and told me about my liver, she was just kinda like, ""Oh, it's no big deal, don't even worry about it."" I had to Google it and found out that not only was it caused by being fat (or drinking, which I don't do), but that if I didn't lose weight, it would turn into cirrhosis, which isn't reversible. My doctor was a lady who listened to my concerns and was awesome in every other way, but I couldn't believe how lightly she treated this. 

I started on a low-carb diet and even just doing it half-assed for like a year, I've fixed my liver and gotten my ALT and AST lower than they've ever been, gotten my pulse down from 100 bpm resting to mid-80s bpm resting, and my blood pressure has been 120/80 for a while now. I'm still very fat, but I can't believe how some simple diet changes fixed all this and how the people I entrusted with my health couldn't tell me the answer was so simple.

_______________________________________________________

Are doctors really so scared of offending patients that they won't come out and tell them that their weight is the cause of their problems? Mind you, neither of these providers were hams - both are/were totally normal weights and my PCP was a vegan (no longer my PCP because she left to practice elsewhere). I'm guessing there must have been complaints and/or lawsuits from hams bitching about hurt fee-fees when advised to lose weight and now doctors can't tell them they're too fat.

fatpeoplestories,"Popped over to the thrift store to see if I could find any treasures. I always check the shoe section, despite being a women’s size 11, because hey, sometimes I get lucky. No luck today, though. 


I’m 5’11”/maybe 10” and around 125 now, down from being over 200+. A seemingly nice, very, /very/ overweight lady was in the shoe section as well, and kicked off a pair of boots in a huff. She said, “they never have my size!”  To no one in particular.


She was about 5’2” and easily 200 lbs heavier than me, for reference. 


I laughed and said, “oh, me neither!” I’m super socially awkward, and have been trying to talk to people more. It’s led to some positive interactions with strangers before! Usually with nice ladies in random stores. Not this time, though. 


Big mistake. She turns, gives me a once over and scowls at me. Mind you, this woman has some tiny looking feet. Maybe size 4 or 5. Mine are noticeably gigantic, especially in the sh*t-stomping docs I was currently wearing. I empathize that it’s hard to find very small sizes as well as huge sizes. 


She says, “you don’t get to complain. Your big feet are natures way of balancing that rail-thin body of yours.” 


Oh, okay? I’m uncomfortable now, so I chuckle, nod, and just move to the next aisle. She follows me there just to say, “Y’know, there’s (a burger place) next door. You should probably spend your money there instead of here.” 


Lady, what the hell? I’m so done with the “you need to eat a burger!” stuff. I’ve eaten more than my fair share in the past. No need to be rude. I used my gigantic hobbit feet to walk tf away from that rudeness. ","I deserve to have big feet, apparently"
fatpeoplestories,"Inspired by this morning’s story about the “conceited” girl at the gym...

The scene: The 25 ft (or meter, idk, ask Ragen since she seems to be the expert) lap pool at the gym. The lap pool is adjacent to a spa tub, which will come into play later. 

Be me: F/35. Slowly getting back into shape. A hot bit of muscle on top with a soggy bottom. Overweight according to BMI but not by much, flat chested, so what an FA would call “anorexic.” I’ve got on a cute swimsuit and am just here to swim laps. 

Don’t be: PoolHam. F/25-45, it’s really hard to tell. Approx 350lbs at 5 foot 2, all crammed into a black 1-piece with a neon butt ruffle and visible areola up top due to inappropriate sizing. Full face of way too much makeup. 

Probably don’t be: PoolHam’s boyfriend. 6 foot, probably 120 lbs. Unfortunate teeth and odd body hair distribution.

It’s ok to be: PrettySwimmer. Maybe 19, 5 ft 3, 125ish lbs. Gorgeous. Fit. Definitely motivational. 

The lap pool at this gym has four lanes, and I am minding my own business in the far left lane (lane #1). I choose this lane because there are steps on the right side (lane #4), which I like to leave open for other people who might have difficulty getting in and out of the pool. 

I’m alone in the pool when the boyfriend arrives. He gets in via the steps and moves left to lane #3. He also begins his laps, minding his own business. 

Then PoolHam arrives in all her ruffle-butted, areola-baring glory. She enters via the steps and stands at the end of lane #4. While changing directions in my lane I notice her eye me up and down. Whatever, I only have a few laps to go.

“Switch lanes with me,” she demands from the boyfriend. He complies as if he’s used to this request. He continues his laps in lane #4 while PoolHam treads water in lane #3. 

It’s then that I notice she is moving back and forth in the lane in a very deliberate way to make sure she is standing between the boyfriend and myself at all times. She’s clearly on high alert. 

Enter PrettySwimmer. Dives into lane #2 like an expert and starts her workout. PoolHam clearly has a problem. 

“Let’s go to the hot tub now,” she shouts to her boyfriend. He complies immediately and trots off to join her in the vacant jacuzzi. 

PrettySwimmer finishes up, dries off, and leaves. I admire her ass as she leaves and resolve to spend more time doing squats. 

I’m also done with my workout and think to myself that a moment in the jacuzzi sounds good. I get out of the pool and find a good spot in the tub across from PoolHam and her boyfriend. 

What happened next I wish I could block out my memory. After giving me another up-and-down look and a brief sucking of her teeth, she climbs on top of the boyfriend to sit in his lap, shoving her tongue down his throat and lightly grinding on him. He doesn’t seem into it, but he doesn’t resist either. 

I’ve had enough and get out to dry off and leave. The last thing I hear before entering the locker room is her whispering, “can you believe she wore THAT to the pool?”

fatpeoplestories,"My oldest brother had braces, when he got them off we moved and he lost his retainer. He didn't tell my parents and his teeth got refucked up. He got a second pair of braces to fix them. I got braces. EEB has always had perfect teeth. 

Now, because EEB didn't need braces he demanded gastric bypass. His reasoning was that both were for aesthetic reason. In his 20's he brought up a news article of a 16 year old girl getting it and that ""see, people buy their kids this! It's fucked up I didn't get to get this done! You guys got braces and they're the same thing!"" And from then on solely blamed my parents for his weight.

Also, he tried to demand the money it would cost to have braces done ""since oldest and Mymass got it, I should get the money too"". Which was ridiculous and I at one point said ""so if I got some disease and it cost mom and dad like $30k in medical treatments to get me better, you'd expect for you and oldest to get a $30k check in the mail?"" His response was ""well, not oldest.""

He truly and in his whole heart believed that ANYTHING I or oldest received he was entitled to. To the extent he'd pay for it himself and try to make my parents feel bad for not getting it for him.

Anyway, Amy messaged me again a few days ago and sheepishly told me that after we chatted, she started googling ""anaemia"" and convinced herself that she was anaemic. The symptoms she picked out were:

* Shortness of breath
* Irritability
* Weakness 
* Fatigue

You can guess where this is going. 

She took a blood test, went to a specialist armed with her lab report and told her that she must be anaemic and that's why exercising is so hard for her, and she gets out of breath easily.

fatpeoplestories,"First story is second-hand from one of my co-workers. Said co-worker's older sister had a heart attack a few months back (I think it's what inspired that co-worker to start losing weight). Big Sister is only about 34 years old and had a heart attack of the widowmaker variety (widowermaker?), but managed to survive. When concerned folks were asking what caused it, Co-Worker explained that the doctors weren't sure, but that it might have been due to Big Sister's hypertension, or her uncontrolled diabetes, or quite possibly the fact that she's about 500 pounds. Yeah, it's probably at least one of those. I feel bad for Big Sis, but you gotta work at it to get that big and unhealthy that you have an MI before 35.

______________________________________________

Second story is from earlier when I was eavesdropping on a conversation at the store that a very, very large woman (like 600+ pounds) was having with someone about how her TSH of 16 is why she's so big. Mmkay first of all, while that's abnormal, it's not absurdly high. Second of all, most people who know anything about thyroid disease can tell you that a busted thyroid only accounts for maybe like 5-15 extra pounds, not several hundred.

fatpeoplestories,"Hi FPS, Red here. Had a hamsperience yesterday I think y'all would get a kick out of.

I'd like to begin by saying I've noticed that the holidays seem to bring out the best in people, especially in a retail environment.

... Kidding. I'm kidding.

I went grocery shopping yesterday. I used to work at this particular store, so I know where everything is. Auto-customer service mode doesn't really shut off when you're in a place you're that familiar with, so I don't have a problem butting in to conversations when I hear people wondering about the location of ____. So when a (very) large and in charge Marge asked aloud (to nobody in particular) ""I wonder where they hide the marshmallows in this place?"" I instinctively replied, ""Aisle 8, halfway down.""

Marge whipped around and literally barked, ""I wasn't asking *you*.""

&gt;Ok. In that case, they're in Aisle 20.

There is no Aisle 20. She scrunched her face at me like a toddler and walked away.

Several minutes later, I'm in produce picking out sweet potatoes when someone starts yelling. I turn to see Marge shouting in the face of a very tall, very astonished man with a cart full to the top with standard Thanksgiving ingredients. 

&gt;YOU KNOW YOU OUGHT TO LEAVE SOME STUFF FOR EVERYONE ELSE, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO NEEDS TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES FOR THANKSGIVING. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING, HOARDING ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS LIKE THAT?

The man interjected he was purchasing for a church luncheon but Marge was on a roll, and started *pulling stuff out of his cart* as she shouted.

&gt;YOU HAVE LIKE FOUR TURKEYS. WHAT IF I NEEDED A TURKEY? WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY BOXES OF BROWN SUGAR? I NEED THIS. WHY ARE YOU TAKING IT ALL?

The man was beginning to shout back at her at this point, trying to move his cart away and grab back the items she was taking out and putting in her own cart.

&gt;There's more on the shelf, lady! What the hell is your problem?! 

The produce manager and the front end manager had come running by this point, and tried vainly to reason with Marge.

&gt;Ma'am! There is plenty here for everyone! You can't just take someone else's shopping!

&gt;THERE ARE NO MORE MARSHMALLOWS ON THE SHELF AND THIS MAN HAS TAKEN THEM ALL. I HAVE KIDS TO FEED. LOOK AT HIM, HE DOESN'T NEED ALL THIS FOOD. I NEED THIS FOOD. 

&gt;Ma'am, you need to calm down and give this man his food back or we will have to ask you to leave. You can't just take someone's stuff! 

Marge went off. Lots of ""how dare you's"" and ""sexism"" and ""discrimination"". Always coming back to the point of ""I need this food!"" The tall man had managed to salvage most of his shopping from her basket and rushed away. 

The managers were repeating that she needed to leave or they would have to call the police when a man I presume was Marge's husband showed up. He seemed annoyed.

&gt;What the fuck is going on here?

Marge burst into tears and ~~whaled~~ wailed an extremely dramatized version of the events.

&gt;BABY, THESE MEN ARE HARASSING ME! THEY LET A MAN WHO ASSAULTED ME GET AWAY AND THEY WON'T LET ME BUY FOOD FOR THANKSGIVING!

The man looked at the ceiling and made a face like he was contemplating hanging himself from it.

&gt;For fuck's sake, Marge, you came in here to buy a bag of goddamn pretzels. We have everything we need at home for Thanksgiving. Why are you in here making a goddamn fuss?

Marge turned very red. The man noticed her full cart.

&gt;We don't need any of that. Let's get the goddamn pretzels and go. Jesus, can we go ANYWHERE without you being a fucking idiot?

Marge had started to cry in earnest, and rushed away with her cart. 

The man looked around and saw everyone staring at the awkward spectacle, heaved a giant sigh, apologized to the baffled managers, and walked after his wife. 

I ended up in line behind a slightly red-eyed Marge. She watched me put brussels sprouts and asparagus on the belt, followed by the rest of my groceries. Apparently she felt discomfited, because she couldn't let it pass without a non-sequitur.

&gt;I used to be a vegetarian and my doctor said it was the unhealthiest I'd ever been. 

I didn't respond, I just kind of [Jim-faced](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/92462-reaction-images) and stared blankly above her head. 

She finally paid, and moved her cart to the end of the check stand to load bags containing a lot more than just pretzels. My groceries were now being scanned, and I wasn't paying attention to Marge anymore. 

&gt;Ma'am, those cookies aren't part of your order.

I looked over as the cashier spoke. Marge dropped my one guilty pleasure purchase, my delicious Pepperidge Farm linzer cookies, back on the check stand and scuttled away. The cashier made eye contact with me and just shook her head.

**TL;DR:** Bitch tries to steal my cookies.",Marge Goes Shopping
fatpeoplestories,"I have an update about HateVeggies and her demon baby, whom I wrote about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/72rau8/my_friend_just_created_a_demon_baby/?st=jok89mmt&amp;sh=eca0312e). 


Since my last story, I've only met HateVeggies twice since she lived about 2-3h away from me, depending on traffic (now we're in totally different countries). Totally not because I fear getting slaughtered by her demon baby, of course. 


My first meeting was a few months after the previous story, and Baby was nearly 2 now. It was just the two of us with Baby at a Japanese restaurant, and the only thing Baby was eating was a few spoonfuls of udon and goldfish crackers. 

&gt; ""Do you think we should add maybe some protein into Baby's meal? Maybe tofu, or beef, or chicken?"" I asked tentatively. I didn't even dare mention veggies since that always gets her defensive and angry.

&gt; ""Nah!"" HatesVeggies replied dismissively, ""She won't eat them. It's really hard to get her to eat, so I'm just grateful she's eating!""

Again, Baby did not seem to have any problems eating. She was ignoring the udon noodles and only eating the goldfish crackers now, but I suspect it was because her mom was no longer spoonfeeding her, so goldfish crackers were easier to much on while she completely absorbed in watching some cartoon on her iPad. 

At full volume. 

Yes, HatesVeggies turned out to be one of those dickish parents who think the entire world needs to be subjected to their kids annoying cartoons to pass the misery around. 

I once made a lighthearted facebook post saying that I wasn't sure if kids who play games/watch videos on their mobile phones with the volume are brats or this is the new norm and I'm just a cranky old lady, and HatesVeggies and a bunch of other presumably bad parents got extremely butthurt, yelling, ""Would you rather have a screaming kid??"" and ""Do you know headphones can damage a child's hearing?!?!""

It was so hard not to reply with: 

  1. Go to Japan 
  2. See how polite &amp; well-behaved children there are
  3. An entire nation just proved you're just a shitty parent


&gt; ""Maybe we can give it a try today? Who knows, it could be the day she discovers she loves wagyu beef!"" I ""joked"". 

My food just arrived and I made sure I immediately made a small platter for Baby that has horenzo spinach, beef and tofu. Baby ignored the platter.

&gt; ""See?"" HatesVeggies pointed out triumphantly, ""She's not even interested!""

Er. I think that was because this kid had not looked up from her iPad a single time. I couldn't engage her at all; she was a total zombie.

&gt; ""This kid has such a hard time eating, I'm so stressed out!"" HatesVeggies continued, ""I just want her to eat, so I give her whatever gets her eating. She's soooo skinny!""

&gt; ""Really?"" I asked, ""She looks like she's a normal size to me.""

Seriously. The only red flags I see in her looks is the fact that she's barely 2 and has deep and dark hollows under her eyes. She was going full raccoon and not even old enough to have a good reason to be sleep deprived.

&gt; ""Yeah! When I change her, I can see her ribs! It's so scary! She's way too skinny and needs to gain weight!""

I was confused but dropped it at this point, but I later found out that it's completely normal to see ribs (as long as they're not extremely pronounced) on kids from my paediatrician friend who was ranting about how people's perception of a ""normal weight"" has been completely skewed thanks to prevalence of childhood obesity. 

Anyway, as soon as my ice cream came, Baby started lunging at it and helping herself to it. This kid *really* has no problems eating. 

I then remembered it was a *coffee* flavoured ice cream and quickly took it away, and I unleashed Demon Baby mode all over again. Great, this kid is still addicted to caffeine. 

___________


2nd time I met HatesVeggies was at ExVegetarian's wedding. She was complaining about how she can't carry cute clutches anymore because she has to carry Baby's food since Baby was ""such a picky eater"".

She opened her bag to reveal a bag full of snacks and a box of sugary ""juice"". 

Baby should be at least 2 years old now, and she's still living on snacks.


___________

Finally, a few days ago, I saw her make [this](https://i.imgur.com/LYdxqvD.jpg) post on facebook. 
",Update on my friend's demon baby.
fatpeoplestories,"[Part I] (https://redd.it/9wk1l6)

It’s the grabby greediness in this incident that really cemented the Tubby Trolls’ status as ham planets for me. I used to be fat and Bert himself is quite the chubby little bunny, but the Trolls: they’re just pushy greedy pigs who shove people out of the way and are never satisfied. Ugh.

A relevant note about shirts: when bands sell shirts they have to order a minimum print run per design and size (usually a gross) and pay up front. This is why smaller/lower budget bands only have one or two options and a limited range of sizes. Huge sizes are not always offered by the printing company and they cost more and take up extra shipping weight/cost and space in boxes, and if you pass the extra costs to the customer you get accused of being fatphobic. Bands loooooove to pay up front for a size maybe 10 people will buy. /s  Sauce: I used to sling cotton for bands. Bert &amp; Ernie already have a low mark-up on merch (and tickets) and so are cutting their profit margins slim as it is.

Meet Big Bird: singer in a local metal band. Friends with Ernie. He’s come to the show with his girlfriend to have a fun night out.

On to the tale…

It’s another holiday club party (They throw AMAZING parties, I can’t help myself). 

Ernie has a bunch of communion wine trays filled with hundreds of **free** mini-shots of liqueur. *The band paid for this.* He passes them out while ranting about the pope. His intent is for everyone to do a nasty sugary anti-molestation toast with him.

The Tubby Trolls seize a tray by pushing and shoving through the crowd to intercept it! and take *as many shot cups as they can*!! They’re pulling cups out, shooting them, and then taking more. “Take one drink and pass the tray!” admonishes Ernie. He’s so tall that he can see exactly what’s happening over everyone’s heads and he’s getting irked. The tray, much MUCH lighter now, is finally passed along. 

Bert gets out a bottle of vodka and gives it to the front row to be shared through the crowd. When it gets too close to the Trolls it gets snatched away and disappears into EndocrineDisorder’s coat pocket. “Sharing is caring!” Ernie says in English. 

The Trolls clearly do NOT care to share the free booze. 

Bert’s eyes get extra squinty — he and Ernie share A Look. I think this is when Ernie began to simmer.

Well, it’s been fun. I’m excusing my way between very tall people and bouncing up on my toes to see where I’m going when I smack right into Bert, who is brandishing his cigarettes and doing the same short-people rabbit-action in the opposite direction. He’s all sweetness and light: he’s going to play hooky and leave Ernie to wrangle fans. He thinks it’s funny. That’s the last you’ll see of Bert for the night.

I get stuck in the merch-table line. There’s a low wall preventing me from exiting it, which of course I couldn’t see ‘til I got there, coz short. Can’t do a damn thing to get out, so I shuffle along and people-watch.

The Tubby Trolls have cornered Big Bird at coat check. They’re drunk: the copious amounts of free booze they stole from everyone else was enough to baste even the largest Christmas Ham. CokeBeard is wearing the same dirty clothes, complete with food stains, that he wore the last time I saw him. Big Bird politely signs a thing, but they want A Conversation. Big Bird is squirming: his girlfriend pats his back sympathetically and leaves without him. Big Bird is looking around for help, any help at all, and me and several other people chuckle at his predicament. Oh, if looks could kill…he shows us all the back of his hand. We laugh. Karma will slap me for this in part III.

I wind up in front of Ernie. He’s getting restless and spends a little time roasting the hell out of me about US Politics for his own entertainment. Then there is a complaint that the line is not moving. NO POINTS IF YOU GUESS WHO.

It’s CokeBeard and EndocrineDisorder! They’re now at the back of the line and Big Bird is standing outside smoking and looking ruffled. For all their vices the Trolls don’t smoke, so I guess it’s a good defence. Oh, CokeBeard, I almost made it through a whole show without dealing with you! Thank you for proving that there is indeed a God and s/h/it’s a sadist.

“Where’s Beeert?” whines CokeBeard, jiggling. “What’s the hold-up? Whyyy isn’t Bert giving autographs?” He implies that Bert is ungrateful to the people come to his shows.

JFC, some people won’t learn. 

“**Bert’s gone!**” Ernie gets a touch of the crazy eyes and digs stuff out of the depths of the merch counter and shoves it at me. He often gives things away on a whim, but EndocrineDisorder *just has to ask* if the merch is free tonight (sure it is: like all artists, Ernie pays his bills with exposure points.) In response, Ernie hands me a CD.

“Save some for me!” says EndocrineDisorder. Why can’t you just be cool, guy? 

Ernie’s eyebrows are getting wiggly, which is not a good sign. “Do you smoke?” He yanks a taped-down display pack of souvenir cigarettes off the merch counter so forcefully that the tape screeches and the counter-top lifts up. Everyone turns to stare at the ruckus. He rips all the tape off the pack with excessive force and crushes it into a very tiny ball while glaring at EndocrineDisorder. He slams the pack down in front me in a righteous display of passive aggression. 

CokeBeard loudly hopes the band has finally started printing 6XL shirts. “Fat people want shirts too! Why don’t you sell shirts for fat guys?!?!” (He’s grown over the last couple years, apparently. Last time it was 5XL.) Ernie asks if I need a lighter and pats himself down for one while snarling about US Foreign Policy and giving the back of the line the stink eye. “DON’T GIVE EVERYTHING AWAY BEFORE WE GET THERE!” CokeBeard yells. Plz recall from last time that he brought A BAG of stuff to sign. How much shit do you need, dude? He is trying to push his way up front with no success (remember the wall? Thanks, wall!) and everyone glares at him. Seriously, what is with all the frikkin’ shoving?

Ernie tells me to go smoke his delicious cigarettes. He slaps a free CD down in front of the guy who’s next in line. “Here, take a lapel pin too. Want a shirt?” 

These shows clearly don’t end smoothly. I zip out the front door and light up outside where it’s peaceful and snowing. Haven’t smoked for a year. So good.

A minute later Ernie can be faintly heard announcing that he’s done signing autographs. He ran out of free merch before the Trolls got to him. *What a coincidence*.

The Tubby Trolls come oozing out the door with zero free stuff and meekly waddle down the street toward the tram stop. 

Interesting. 

I’m enjoying my headrush when Ernie bounds up the front steps. He’s dashed all the way through the dance floor, out the back, and around the outside of the club. 

*Fascinating*.

The Trolls squeeze onto the tram, (CokeBeard is wider than the front door,) and are whisked away with a screech and a clang. Ernie is visibly peeved. He plants his feet, folds his arms, and watches them go. I watch them go. Intrigued bystanders watch them go. Big Bird watches them go. NO ONE. Makes. A peep. We all just stand there. Riveted. In the snow. Musing.

And then Big Bird sensibly said his feet were cold and his girlfriend was waiting on him, and we all scattered.

You would think the Trolls had finally learned a lesson, wouldn’t you? But wait, wait, *there’s more*: A Great Stench looms on the horizon and Ernie deploys strategery…

fatpeoplestories,"Bit of a warning contains private and nude images being leaked

 I'm a bit drunk as i'm writing this and feeling a bit introspective, this story will probably be a lot less gross and entertaining and i don't think i can try make it as funny as others but i will try. 

I've been reading through a possibly worrying amount of fps lately and one theme that comes up regularly especially in female centered stories is the constant attention seeking and hyper-sexuality. I thought at times that maybe it was all made up just to make a more interesting story, spice up the drama or fatten up the plot, but then i spoke to my ex and memories came rushing back. So without further delay your characters:

* Me: 15, Average weight and height, recently got a GF, punching above my weight, too shy and awkward at the time.
* GF: 15, hot girl, shyer and more awkward than me.
* Princess: 16, the main focus of this story, short and round, probably about 5ft 2 and 45% body fat, spoilt.

So in year 10 aged 15 i managed to convince a girl to like me enough to date me, which with my limited social skills was a huge accomplishment, so in order to not be left behind and dumped I decided to make her friends my friends. GF's friends all took lunch inside in a hall/empty classroom inside taking up half the room and multiple tables every break and lunchtime. Me and GF got there early and i spotted the best seat in the house, thick padding, perfect recline angle, it was the bomb. I dump my arse down and get comfy, GF gives me an odd look but i'm too comfy to care. A few more of GF's friends filter in and they give me the dire warning,

&gt;Thats Princesses Chair.  
&gt;  
&gt;I wouldn't sit there if i was you.

I blow it off and start talking until a shadow is cast over me, she stood with her belly perched on the back of the seat, a thick cloud of hollister brand perfume chokes me.

&gt;That's my seat.

I stammer out something in response, along the lines of ""sorry i was here first"" which in British translates roughly to fuck off. She huffs and forces her so called friend out of the next best seat. I ignore it mostly because i enjoy having a girlfriend and don't want to make a fuss and end up going back to the dreary single life, lunch passes and the day ends uneventfully. This continued or the next few months as i slowly spent more and more time with them as my own friends cut me off because i was apparently ""too good"" for them now. I now had the joy of underhanded comments about my or GF's recent weight loss when we both went from slightly puffy pre-teens to the new hotness over the summer somehow. Still it beat dealing with the people i called friends for the past 3 years so i stuck around.

I started to notice a trend every few months, hushed whispers of diet, a very irritable princess, a powder keg ready to blow. It turns out Princess tried more fad diets than i knew existed, keto, atkins, paleo,lemon juice, she would cycle through them and take out all of her rage on the friend group, this started with withdrawing and being uncommunicative  just grunting and huffing to replace speech and got worse as the diet went on. The next step was berating all the loud eaters around her for rubbing our hot bodies and working metabolisms in her face while she half sobbed into her store bought Caesar salad with dressing and a packet of salt and vinegar crisps washed down with a litre bottle of lucozade or coke. (not diet of course) A bit of a side note every day before school i had to walk my dog a big old German shepherd for 40-50 minutes then shower dress and get on a packed bus at about 7.15 so i almost always skipped breakfast, this made my snacks and lunch very important for me. This led to a conflict of interest, if Princess couldn't pig out and had to make do with a salad and a single bottle of sugar, then no one was allowed to eat. Eventually when she got around to calling me out i was ready, i stared her straight in her beady eyes and shoved an entire sandwich in my mouth without blinking. I obviously got called an arsehole, blamed for making her fail her diet but i did feel like i had finally grown a personality after 15 years.

Surprisingly the diets had no effect and she returned to her regular lunch of two sausage rolls crisps and sausage roll and a sandwich. Life went back to normal and i blanked her out of existence whenever it was convenient, so generally as much as humanly possible, that was until a boy became a man and GF told her one friend who told another friend who must have screamed it from the rooftop or something because everyone knew somehow. I was suddenly dropped onto Princesses radar, maybe the only thing that demanded her attention more than food was sex. This led to the two of us being interrogated daily for any details, positions, duration, size, technique, satisfaction it was way too much for any 15 year old to handle, never mind the tag team of awkwardness that me and GF were. Too many questions, too young, not enough experience or confidence to be able to answer properly. Personal questions with salt and vinegar stench almost became a trigger for me. 

What took her attention elsewhere? Sometime around that summer messenger and snap apps became huge at my school, why i have no idea other than the option to send pictures and group chats i guess. Princess was addicted adding practically everyone in school bombarding them with heavily filtered pictures taken from those magic angles that girls know how to find that suddenly turn them from a 5 to 10. In this case a 2.5 to a 6.

After the initial craze died out people went back to talking to each other or whatever people do i guess, everyone but princess that is. Constantly messaging and sending pictures to some lucky probably unlucky recipient, nobody knew who this mysterious person was not even her best friend. All we could conclude after an intense investigation was that it was a boy or boys who went to our school, other than this she was incredibly tight lipped. That was until it happened. 

Now i'm sure most schools have a similar story nowadays but i guess this might be distressing for some people who may have experienced something similar. I think you can guess where this is headed.

Now i absolutely did not like Princess, i thought she was stuck up, rude and could do with a good smack to the face or five but i don't think she deserved this. Princess somehow ended up messaging a group of boys, this group being the schools resident bad boys. They treated her as a joke and egged her on, giddy from all the new found ""sexual"" attraction she was suddenly receiving she sent them anything they wanted. Somehow the boys ended up with saved copies of everything, pictures, videos, everything. The worst of all being a video including her face in which she used hand soap as lube, obviously the banter about the videos needed to be shared with the rest of the school and so did the videos. The videos were sent around constantly everyone knew about it, we had warnings in our classes about this and the police even had to get involved. The boys were caught after the whole school saw it but typically like most cases they got off with a slap on the wrist and a short suspension.

Princess dealt with it in a strange way almost seeming proud to her closest friends including GF in private but others had to join into her pity party, i assume she craved the so called sexual attention she received but she also wanted pity and care, to be fawned over. The so called having your cake and eating it. 

The next year came and went with no major events other than princess cycling through a series of ""boyfriends"" we asked who they were, or if they were in our year group. Nope they were older and not in our school, maybe they went to a different school? No chance turns out the older boys meant older men, the oldest being around 26 or 27 compared to her 15 or 16 years old. As horrible as this was it wasn't my place to step in to help or judge, her parent knew about it and gave permission i believe if they cared enough that is.

 Luckily for me our friend group fell apart and we lost contact very quickly, i believe now she has 2 or 3 children with 2 different fathers. Looking back i feel sorry for her in a way, but her general attitude was awful, as if all attention not focused on her was wasted.

Someone I know via facebook posted on her own timeline that she was annoyed someone had posted in that group had posted a recipe for ""**Chocolate Cheesecake with crushed Oreos and a Rice Krispie treat crust**"" suggesting that kind of food is awful. Personally that does sound a bit awful to me (too many super-sweet layers!), but in all fairness, I'm sure many people think my favorite recipes are awful, too. (I mean, I eat roasted cauliflower tacos.)

  
 The comments from her and her  fat friends were somewhat amusing and a bit horrifying:

* ""That (recipe) sounds good to me! I should make this as a dessert at work!""

* ""Anyone that doesn’t love Rice Krispie treats is the devil.""  

* ""I prefer to make my Rice Krispie treats with Fruity Pebbles! (heart emojis)""

fatpeoplestories,"It was around 10pm and I didn’t want to walk back to my apartment that late so I called a lyft and he pulls up in a little Prius.  I slide in and I see this rather large man, he’s pooling over into the passenger seat. 

He was probably 5’8, 300 lbs. 
I’m 5’2, 120. 

He offers me candy and I declined because lately I haven’t been working out as much and wanted to lean out maybe 10 lbs or so.

The lyft driver than berates me for being on a diet and told me I didn’t know how to lose weight effectively.  He said it’s more about exercise than food (so...not true???).  He then asked if I ever tried biking.  I am not a biker personally, I don’t like the position and I feel like I get a better cardio workout when running.  The lyft driver continues to tell me because I’m not biking right, that’s why I’m not losing weight.  At this point, I’m more in shock than anything.  I’m consistently between a size XS/S in clothes.  The only problem I have is wanting to be more muscular and lean but this blob of a human being is giving me diet advice? 

Not one to be impolite I just brush it off and await my drive home.  He then tells me that he guesses that “I’m not fat” but I can benefit from eating leaner meats like turkey and such.  Now I’m stunned by his oblivion??? His arm was thicker than my 26” waist.  And he continues to tell me if I need diet or work out advice, he’s someone who i should strive to be more like.

One Monday, me and another coworker (who was also obese but had surgery and was losing some weight and had a sense of humor about it) discovered a mystery Arbys box in the fridge.  It contained a rost beef sandwich.  We had no idea whos it was or how long it had been there.  We found this funny and left it be.  

Friday rolls around and we decide to check up on it.  Still there.  So we decide it must have been forgotten and pitch it, like any sane person would.  I left after (this was around 5pm), but apparantly the office 400 pound landcow opened the fridge after I left and got very mad that her 5 day old (minimum) sandwich was gone.  We never fessed up because fuck her for leaving it in there.

**But here is the creepy part.  Her young neices who she watched for her meth head brother were constantly ill, and she wasn’t much better.  Her brother was also never well (aside from the meth). At first we just rolled our eyes about the sandwich, but then I started to think:  maybe she was planning on taking it home and feeding it to those kids.  Possibly to get them sick so she could avoid work to watch them, or so she could feel like she was mothering sick children, maybe to make herself sick, maybe to make someone else sick.  Maybe to feed to her dogs (since she was a failed breeder...)

It was saddening to see that they barely fit through the door (it’s a narrowish door I’ll give them that) and when I say barely fit I mean each of their bodies was rubbing against the door frame! 

So I foolishly thought, ah clothes, decorations, body spray, etc. No don’t be stupid, they charge at the cake stall like three hungry hyaenas and start squabbling over the remaining cakes. However their arch nemesis greasy ham 4 screamed that SHE in-fact “pre ordered the cakes” and to “leave them the fuck alone” (absolute crap she didn’t but she didn’t expect 3 obese musketeers to pillage the shop in like half a second) naturally they start screeching at each other. I just look helplessly (I’m the only one on the tills) and I weigh around 60kg, that’s like a small portion of ONE of the hams. 

I try to intervene anyway (as that’s my job apparently, stopping hams from fighting in a charity shop) and one of them shouts “shut the fuck up” and she grabs one of the cakes and LAUNCHES it into the rival grease ham (4). She then gasps for air, not sure if it’s shock she can throw or because of the amount of effort it took to raise the arm. The grease ham 4 starts running towards the rival grease hams and LUNGES her boobs and her entire body mass into the one which threw it, the other two drag her off and throws her into one of the shelves. She falls over and then breaks the shelve (it’s wooden.) 

I shouted that I’m calling the cops in like 5 seconds if they don’t get the hell out of the store, the bitches have the audacity to grab 3 cakes each before leaving, and the one on the floor takes one of the drinks left in the fridge and throw change from her pocket on the floor (it’s customer fridge which they can pick out a drink out of it and buy it at the till.) So this happened over a period of like 3 minutes. 

The shop basically got devastated, raided and pillaged because of a cake dispute and this Is why I have serious suspicions when 2 or more hams are in the store now, I don’t know what the bitches are thinking. 

So how was your Tuesday?",The ham feast
fatpeoplestories,"Skinny shaming is painfully real. I recently lost 65 pounds, taking me from an obese BMI to one barely in the healthy range for my height, yet just about every time my (life long obese) parents see me now, they make demeaning jokes. 


Yesterday I showed them a picture of myself in a new bikini that I got and felt proud of myself in, and they told me it looked like a concentration camp photo because you could see the bones in my shoulders, and a couple of my ribs. I am not even close to being underweight (140 pounds at 5’4”) and it just amazes me how the presence of bones that are supposed to be visible on a human’s body is enough to send them into choruses of how it’s more healthy to have meat on your bones and women aren’t supposed to look like children. I had to get this off my chest, and figured y’all would be the most likely to understand. ",Fat people truly do have no concept of what a healthy weight is and looks like. BMI 24 = literal starvation
fatpeoplestories,"I subbed for four exercise classes I don't  normally teach.  They are basic classics.  Full of retired women striving to lose 15 pounds (they need to lose 75) while learning the basics of exercise and diet.

The level of understanding was about a 5th grade level as far as fitness goes.  So me, being the ex-Physical Education instructor, I took out a copy of one of my lessons titled ""Basic Weight Training"" that I compiled for middle school students.

Basically it is anti-fat-logic.  Debunking myths and sorting out half-truths.  Just generally explaining why we are doing what we are doing in our efforts to become fit.  Or at least fittER.

The hams were nice enough to sit through the short lecture they begged me for.  Mostly they were very quiet.  While some defiantly questioned me as if I was making this shit up.  Some just sitting in and telling me that eventually they were going to bring my ""lesson"" to their doctor to confirm.  

Cringe.  Doctors don't always follow fitness.  Sometimes, it seems, where I live, they are more involved in prescribing popular meds for the 'Betus.

Anyway, I got through the lecture part.  Then we started some basic weight lifting with dumbbells and stability balls.

As soon as I was done explaining the exercise, someone in the class said, ""This Saturday is the Women's club cookie exchange!""

And the masses exploded in excitement all sharing cookie ideas, other bake sales, how to car pool there, etc.

My skinny ass sat there and wondered why the hell I even bothered.","Yeah, yeah, uh-huh. So anyway..."
fatpeoplestories,"I forgot all this happened ‘til my Date (appearing in part III) asked me why Bert smiles when he sees me. Then I realised there was a whole saga for you to enjoy.

Be Me: mid 30s, 5’2”, 115lbs. On holiday in Europe and going to Christmas parties and rock shows. Attending club shows on cruise boat. 

Be Ernie: 6’6” singer in band. Bubbly, witty, outgoing, wrangles alllll the peoples. “Mmmmmmlet’s go sign some autographs Bert! Yaaaaay!” 

Be Bert: 5’5” in boots, guitarist in band. Quiet chain smoker. Wrangles tech and logistics but never people. “Screw you, Ernie, I’m going home.”

Don’t be: The Three Ungrateful Tubby Trolls: PorkKnuckle, EndocrineDisorder, and CokeBeard. All are ~6’+ and they are *round*. Their unwashed cargo shorts are held up with rope because no studded belt is big enough to circle their massive waddling frames. They wear grubby black fingerless gloves and faded black cotton tents for tee shirts, sweat-stained hats they’ve never washed, and have patchy neckbeards. They ooze grease. There is visible dandruff and food stains. They are dedicated groupies and go to most of Bert &amp; Ernie’s shows, and they like to do coke mid-concert.

Don’t be: The Orca Pod. 5-6 women aged 20-40, around 5’4”-5’7” and 250lbs+ each. Like orcas, they hunt in a pack. Can’t see around ‘em. Can’t see over ‘em.

Once upon a time, Bert &amp; Ernie threw a weekend of holiday concerts on a small party boat. 1K tickets max. I showed up. 

Fun is had, music is played. Ernie warns everyone to leave Bert alone. Bert’s factory setting is ‘grumpy’ but now he’s also ill and is making it through the show on Dayquil and willpower. 

Most people in Western Europe are taller than me, but it was mystifying how many women at this show, in this nation of lean babes, were also heavier than me. A LOT heavier. Gasping and struggling to waddle up the gangplank heavier.  Hams comin’ outta the woodwork. But hey, everyone is my friend until proven otherwise, and the band is really laid-back and welcoming, so I bet these women are nice too. Right? Right?! *OH, I WAS WRONG*. 

A couple songs into the show, I’m joined by a most enormous young man. He has cannonballed his way through the crowd and rolled to a halt next to me. *Right* next to me. Everyone in the club is taller than me and wider than me: that’s life. But now I’m stuck. My entire side is smushed up against the majestic gelatinous squishy mass of CokeBeard, and as the club warms up and the headbanging proceeds, he begins to sweat. 

And sweat some more.

Rancid sweat soaks through his shirt and into mine. 
 
CokeBeard is joined by his equally huge friends: EndocrineDisorder and PorkKnuckle. Lighter folks are rammed aside, feet are trod upon, and views are obstructed. They snort some coke and begin bouncing off each other like giant jello salads.

Every few minutes, they run out of beer or pretzels and one shoves himself allll the way back out of the pit to get more. The entire evening is a food relay race: the Trolls are ploughing back and forth clutching six beers each trip, spilling drinks and food on people as the rest of the crowd attempts to ignore the disruption. We are at an exclusive show that sold out 10 months ago and all the Trolls can think about is food, food, more food, beer, and occasionally coke. A pile of their discarded bits of pretzels, fries, paper food trays, and napkins begins to pile up around my ankles. There’s a deposit on drinks, so fistfuls of beer cups are ferried back and forth to ensure they get their money back. 

More sweat. More jiggling. There is no escape. 

By the time it’s over, my shirt is soaked through and dripping with CokeBeard’s greasy sweat and his spilled beer and I’m sprinkled with pretzel salt.

I go to the head. I don’t have room in my tiny suitcase for club clothes so I’m the plainest woman there: black pants and a black long sleeved shirt. No fancy makeup, no nail polish: nothin’.

The Orca Pod, who I have only glimpsed before now, are packed into the ladies room. They’re decked out in goth finery: buckles and lace and Docs and huge flouncy skirts, black lipstick and enormous straining corsets… They’re grumbling that the stalls are too small for them to fit in and there are too many slutty groupies and not enough long-time fans in the crowd. “Dirty groupies everywhere who just want to fuck the band.” They all go silent and glare at me and a couple other much taller skinny chicks at the sink. “I wish we could get rid of these sluts.” The only tits hanging out here are the size of flotation devices and they belong to the Orcas. I make nice, pretend I don’t understand what they’re saying, and squeeze out past them before someone rips my earrings off and stuffs me in a toilet.

Bert and Ernie go straight to their hotel to sleep and I go to mine to scrub CokeBeard’s sweat out of my clothes.

The Trolls and Orcas get on facepage. They are peeved that Ernie didn’t spend time with them and that Bert was nowhere to be seen after the show. They feel the band is ungrateful to their fans. They bombard Bert, Ernie, and the band’s page.

Ernie responds sweetly that he is old and creaky and felt an urgent need to sleep so that he could entertain them all over again the very next day. Bert ignores them.

The second show rolls around and I stand to one side in the back where the Trolls won’t sweat on me and the Orcas won’t punch me. After the show, Ernie is roaming around taking photos and signing every damn thing anyone shoves in his face.

I get distracted on the smoking balcony having a chat and when I open the door to leave, I discover I *can’t* leave. It’s a small boat and the tiny hallway to the exit is stoppered up tight by Ernie taking photos with fans. The Trolls, sweaty and crumby, have surrounded Ernie and are demanding multiple posed photos each and signed everythings. They gush about how long they’ve been fans and how nice it is that the band is playing club shows again for their REAL fans. They have brought along a plastic garbage bag full of stuff to sign! I wait around for like 10 mins: no dice, the fatbergs ain’t movin’ without a roto-rooter.

The Orca Pod is clustered around something which turns out to be Bert. He looks as happy as a wet owl in the selfies they’re taking with him and is clutching a pack of kleenex. He too has discovered that Ernie and the Trolls are blocking the exit and the door to the dressing room. 

It’s getting claustrophobic: Orcas, Trolls, or Germs? Germs it is. Bert thanks the Orca Pod for coming to the show and wobbles for the smoking balcony (when in doubt, freeze ‘em out — it’s 8F outside) with Orcas following in his wake. …I guess I have to. “Bert,” I say, “I’m a huge fan of your solo projects.” He beams and lurches over, gets both arms around me, and uses me to prop himself up. 

One of the trolls is loudly asking if Bert will be signing anything. Bert rests his eyes. The Orca pod makes comments about sluts. Bert ignores everything. Bert want sleep now.

Ernie realises Bert is knackered and trying to nap on random strangers. He roars that they’re done for the night and clears the doors. I make a dash for the exit before I get my ass beat and Bert shuffles like a zombie into the dressing room. 

The next day, the Tubby Trolls and the Orca Pod post angrily to facepage. Their complaints? Foreigners in the crowd who didn’t speak their language very well. (Ooh, hey I'm a foreign devil!) There wasn’t a full dinner offered! There was not a free drink token included with the ticket and beer was expensive! The custom tee shirt options didn’t include 5XL!! The crowd was too tight and the boat was cramped. There weren’t enough chairs in the upper deck seating area, the chairs were too small, and some people can’t stand up for 3 hours at a rock show!

Gentle reader, tickets were 44 Euro for: a custom t-shirt in your exact size/cut, a lanyard, a pin, a calendar, sticker, postcard, a snazzy souvenir ticket stub, and it all came in a fancy display box. No way a 5XL shirt would have even FIT in the damn box. Beer was only 3.50/lg each! There was ample space on the upper deck with little cafe tables and chairs and the bar was serving snacks.

They are outraged that Ernie didn’t spend enough time signing stuff and where the hell was Bert? Whyyyyyy didn’t Bert sign things and pay attention to them? 

It blew my mind. Ernie’s a good sport and I saw him sign stacks of shit and take photos with ALL of these people!

Never get between Bert and Ernie. 

Ernie goes off. 

He posts a sermon about how thrilled he was to have guests from all over the world — it feels good to know that people came so far to see them and appreciate the years of hard work and constant effort he and Bert have put in to make it to a point where they can earn enough money to survive on music. He lists off all the countries represented at the show. 

He tells everyone that the whole party weekend didn’t make the band any money: they did it just to have fun, and poor Bert is now corpsified. 

The kerfuffle grows and the comments explode. The sane majority doesn’t understand why the fatbergs are complaining, and do they expect Ernie to give them all a kidney too?

Ernie begins conversating in English to ram his point home. Then he goes through his ticket list, cross-references it with facepage, and starts messaging foreign fans privately to thank them for attending. My phone dings at 3AM: it’s Ernie. Holy Hell. I wake up with a scratchy throat and a runny nose to this bullshit crazypants whinefest. In case you were wondering: Bert ignores everything.

The Trolls are sent packing back under their bridge and the Orcas back to their SeaWorld tank. One would think that a public shaming for being so greedy and ungrateful would have rammed home the lesson, but they didn’t stay there for long...",Bert &amp; Ernie and the Three Tubby Trolls: A Rock Opera…? Part I
fatpeoplestories,"In another sub, someone was asking how to stop a family member from sabotaging their weight loss efforts, and saying the progress they had made. I mentioned this sub, ""fat to fit Fridays"", and ""crabs in a bucket"".

Immediately got a response - automoderator had deleted my post because I was promoting a hate sub. How the heck is FPS considered a hate sub? Ironically, the sub where I posted could be considered a hate sub (people bitching about mother's-in-law for doing mother-in-law stuff).",Meta: How is this a hate sub?
fatpeoplestories,"I work in an office and most of my co-workers are very obese and have the usual accompanying condishuns like diabetes, hypertension, bad/replaced knees, and so on. Many of them are on diets, and while some are actually seeing some success, some aren't and just can't figure out why. Two such people stand out in my mind.

Ham #1 is doing low carb/keto, or so she says. Quite often, she'll eat something packed with carbs and will say that she's ""not doing keto today."" I understand having a cheat day here and there when on any diet, but if you're only dieting one day a week (if that) and the other six days are cheat days, I don't think it's going to have the expected results. She also seems to think that doing keto means she can eat huge amounts of fat, which I think is typically okay on a low-carb diet, but not when that super fatty food is also loaded with carbs! Big shock, Ham #1 loves to tell everyone how she doesn't understand why she's not losing weight and how ""keto doesn't work!"" At this point, I usually hear Chris Farley in my head going, ""Hmm, that's a mystery!""

Ham #2 has been going to a nutritionist as part of her diet. Apparently, this nutritionist told her that if she messes up and eats too much or eats something she shouldn't, she needs to learn to forgive herself, move on, and try to do better tomorrow. Good advice because most folks will screw up here and there while dieting - it happens, we're only human after all. Ham #2 decided to interpret this advice a little differently than intended and seems to think that she can eat whatever the hell she wants on her diet (I think she's just cutting calories for her diet), and as long as she forgives herself, it's all good. Needless to say, she has become *very* forgiving of herself. She basically eats the same as before and just says she's sorry and forgives herself and then shovels forbidden food into her face. I guess she thinks it's like a magic spell and if she just says it, she'll lose weight while making no changes at all in regard to her food choices. She's also surprised she's not losing weight using this method.

Not the worst thing here by any stretch, I know. I love all my co-workers and wish them all the success on their weight loss journeys, but holy crap, I don't know WTF they're expecting will happen when they claim to be on diets and then don't change their eating habits!",Work hams and their diets that don't work
fatpeoplestories,"Okay, this happened earlier this year. I think about it often and kind of feel bad about it but here it goes.

I work for a widely known non profit organization in the United States. I’ll note that this part of the country is definitely NOT associated with high obesity rates.  Anyway, I was tasked with going to a regional office where I was to work with a group of 5 or 6 of my coworkers from various departments to stuff something like 400 gift bag type things. This took all day and the topic of conversation varied widely and we were all having a pretty good time talking and working. 

So we got on the topic of talking about Europe for some reason, and everyone was making comments about the differences between European countries and America. I chimed in at some point that I noticed, in my travels to Europe and recently in a YouTube video I saw of a street band preforming in Rome or Paris or a big city like that, how very little heavy people you see in Europe. Immediately following this, I kind of looked around the room and realized that every single person there was over weight, or nearing obesity. Myself and maybe one other person there was of healthy size, everyone got quiet and it was like one of the most awkward things I’ve ever experienced, however no one made me feel bad, the topic just changed right there and then. 

I think back on this and feel bad, the heaviest one there definitely doesn’t like me anymore and I attribute it to the comment I made. 

I know this isn’t the usual story shared here, but I think about it a lot and semi cringe at myself, especially since the place I work for is known for affirming people, especially women. So the cringe is real, but what are your thoughts on it? To add, I definitely didn’t speak about my observations in a demeaning way, more like a factual observation ( which is true considering Europe has lower obesity rates).

 Edit: Fixed names of cities ",Said something awkward at work..
fatpeoplestories,"I'm back, its time for a trip to the past years before university hammy. 

Years ago around 2013 maybe 2014 i was in explorer scouts (14-18) our group was well known for being the boys club, basically everyone wanted to be us, we won every district competition hiked further and faster than the others and we didn't get molested by our leaders. Things were pretty sweet for us so it was a surprise when we got told we were merging with (taking over) another local group, we had 5 new members, 3 normal guys, a bit odd at times but overall good lads. The last 2 who were best friends were pieces of work, one is our titular ham and the other was definitely some kind of crazy psychotic and was recently arrested on very serious charges requiring an armed police raid. 

That said its time for our character introduction:

Me/KimJoe: 17yo, More of an observer for this, it was a year or so before i grew a personality, average height and weight.

Verne: 17yo, Named after Verne Troyer, short, chunky, hairy, possible short man syndrome, 5ft even, likes rugby.

Jonny: 16yo, named after Jonny Wilkinson Rugby player, crappy personality, wannabe roadman, about 6ft5 anywhere between 120-150kg, ""pro"" rugby player.

Leader: late 20s, scout leader, did not touch kids.

&amp;#x200B;

So one random evening we get told that we have some fresh meat joining us and as if on cue they walk in, 3 normal guys 2 that i happen to know from school and 2 oddballs. Oddball 1 waddles in blocking the doorway, arms stuck out in that obnoxious invisible lats syndrome pose, i suddenly get the feeling we won't get on. Oddball 2 emerges from behind him muttering under his breath, twitching with a murderous glint in his eye, but he is a story for a different sub. We all introduce ourselves and split into our patrols/teams and line up for the flag, the flag is incredibly important to the association so they are extremely strict on uniform and standing at alert. Alert meaning back straight, legs straight, ankles together and arms straight down thumbs lined up with the seams of our trousers. Simple right just stand up straight. It's so simple anyone can stand like that right? Not Jonny when he gets called out by Leader he claims that its uncomfortable, then that its too hard for him to hold his arms there, finally stringing together a sentence along the lines of my lats are too big to stand like a human. Leader calls bull immediately and waits for him to sort himself out, eventually. 

We finish up and Leader tells the newbies that they should buy a uniform shirt that they run in sizes xs to xxl, xxl is too small for our Jonny he's more of a xxx man himself possibly 4xl on a bad day and has to order a custom made shirt. We get dismissed and start chatting away, oddball 2 scurries away and imagines some murder scenario or something, Verne starts a chat with Jonny to the tune of;

""Jesus you're an absolute unit do you play rugby or something""  (probably not this exactly but close enough)

He replies 

""Yeah i play for professional (City based) club under 18s team""

This gets Verne going being a rugby boy.

""What position?""

He looks like he's caught in a lie but Verne bails him back out.

""You look like a prop""

Jonny agrees and gets away with it before we dig any deeper as we start activities. (For those that don't know the prop position is reserved the biggest, strongest, toughest and ugliest looking players possible, Jonny fit 2 of those criteria.)

&amp;#x200B;

Game time, the beautiful game of British Bulldog (the take down variety) to start with, the game that consist solely of tackling and throwing the other players on the floor until everyone is battered and bruised, guess who gets picked to tackle? He stomps across the solid stone floor into the middle of the hall, you could see his ego being filled. The game starts and we all rush past him darting around the sides, round 1 no losses, round 2,3 and 4 the same. He starts to get angry and pulls out all his rugby tricks trying a hand off move (stiff arm, palm shoved into the face, should be an image example of this) at people running past, he eventually catches me in the nose, blood everywhere and i'm forced to sit out for a while before i see red and start a fight. Jonny gets a bollocking promises to stop smashing his hand in peoples faces and the game goes on, he uses his full size and throws his weight around crushing some of the smaller guys. I eventually get back in time for the last game, me and Verne in the middle together, target sighted. The game starts and Verne rushes ahead planning for a pincer movement, no need for that it took a single moment for the meat mountain to fall down in a jiggling sweating heap. I felt like justice had been served in the most perfect way possible,like David and Goliath, the rest of the night went on as usual and we wondered how Jonny would act once he settled in a bit more. 

Not much changed in general, Jonny constantly tried to throw his weight around and made me and Verne his targets so naturally we gave it back, it wasn't unnatural for a fight to break out but we were normally on the winning side, turns out being able to step sideways comes in pretty handy.

As the weather warmed up and the year went on it was time to plan our hikes and camps, Jonny refused to participate on any hike over 20 miles over a whole weekend or anything with mountains or hills or slight gradients. When we did get him on a hike he managed to turn a 15 mile 4-5 hour day into a 10 hour day, he took constant breaks to pull a lucozade (one of the most sugary drinks possible before they changed the recipe) out of his backpack or to take a quick 5 minute lunch every half mile. If we ever called him out for sitting down in the middle of the path he would throw a tantrum.

""Just leave me then.""

""I'm not made for walking like this""

""It's not my fault i hurt my knee at rugby last night""

He wasn't playing rugby at this point. Hadn't been for months.

Eventually we managed to finish the hike without killing him and burying his body in the woods. He repeated this process for every hike he went on about 4 in total. Things returned to normal after we got home. That was until our long awaited summer camp, 6 days camping, 1 large tent for 7 teen boys, no shower, 1 chemical toilet for 7 boys and 1 unlucky person to empty the toilet each day. Me and Verne on day 1 came up with the fair plan that whoever failed the inspection was on toilet duty, everyone agreed, Jonny failed for 6 days straight. Day 1 inspection was simple get dressed uniform shirt and shorts were allowed and somehow he failed, day 2 set out your kit and get dressed, he (his mother) packed everything into individual plastic shopping bags eg a Tesco bag filled with underwear and he decided to not unpack and failed again. Day 3 he still hadn't unpacked the bags and swore that he had changed his clothes and was putting the dirty clothes back into the bags, another failure. Day 4 the new condition of not stinking up a storm or washing himself failed him, the last 2 days he failed for a mixture of reasons majority being for refusing to wash. His reasoning being the fresh water river passing through the campsite was too cold and he didn't like going shirtless in public. 

Me and Verne had to deal with him until we turned 18 and left, Jonny bulking up further and still trying to assert his dominance over me and Verne until our last day, his personality getting more bitter and miserable by the week. The last i heard or saw of him he was ""dating"" a girl many years younger, 15 to his 19 and his Facebook profile was a heavily filtered picture of him posing unironically with an air-soft pistol (trying to be hood) with dreadlocks. (He's White) 

I'm glad i never stayed in touch.

Turned out a bit longer than i thought it would. In short, big ol ham joins our scout group and tries to muscle us about and fails, is a massive pain on hikes and camps.

fatpeoplestories,"Hi FPS, Red here. I have a story I think y'all might enjoy. It's been a minute since I have ""spun a yarn"" so, forgive my clunky storytelling. Also, I'm wordy - there's a TL;DR at the end.

(If there is not enough fatlogic in this story, please boot me - it very much belongs in BadPeopleStories as well, but I thought there was enough hammery to fit the FPS bill.)

Cast of Characters:

&gt;myself, 30, novice knitter

&gt;Lauren, 50ish, shop owner, fabulous and very Jewish

&gt;Sue, Nancy, Maria, Amy, and Jen - fellow knitters of various ages, very sweet women

&gt;Helen, late 20s-early 30s, the ham

I'm a 30 going on 90 sort of gal, I figured I might as well get a jump on accumulating some new skills to impress the gents at the nursing home. To that end, I recently took up learning to knit. I bought a couple of classes from a local shop and spent a terrifying two hours being instructed to knit and purl with Lauren, the shop's owner. (I've since figured out that she's not mean, she's just very loud, and sometimes her loud comes out in Yiddish.) I am currently ""kvetching"" my way through a waffle scarf with a beautiful blue yarn.

With the lessons at the shop came a truly lovely community of women who gather often at the shop's worktables and knit together. It's precisely what you imagine; there are cookies and tea cakes, hot coffee, the clacking of needles, and the occasional debate on how to interpret a knitting pattern.

I'm not terribly social by nature, but I have gotten comfortable with these ladies. They remember little things, like the fact you went to the doctor, and what did he say about that weird swelling on your leg? And how is your mother's kitchen remodel going? It's a very calm, peaceful, happy little environment.

Or it was.

I showed up for the Saturday morning workshop ten minutes early to make sure I got my favorite spot at the table. I was disappointed to find it occupied by a very fat woman with long, blue, acrylic fingernails. She was struggling to knit because her nails kept getting tangled in the yarn.

As everyone found a seat, a visibly annoyed Lauren introduced us all.

&gt;Ladies, please give a warm welcome to Helen. She just ""graduated"" this morning!

(When you complete a Knitting 101 class, Lauren calls it ""graduation"".)

Everyone very politely wished Helen a good morning. Helen responded with what I can only describe as a smirk, and returned her eyes to her knitting/nails. 

Sue, a very experienced knitter, had sat down next to Helen. She glanced at the tangle of yarn in Helen's hands and said, ""You have very pretty nails, sweetheart, but it might be easier for you to knit if you cut them a little shorter.""

""Yeah, someone already said that. *They* were rude, too."" Helen replied, giving Sue a very bitchy look. Sue looked surprised for a moment before turning away and starting a conversation with Maria. 

Lauren appeared and placed several plates of homemade tea cakes and cookies on the table. ""Does anyone want coffee?""

Helen put her knitting down and reached with both hands for the nearest cookie plate. ""Yes, make mine with five sugars and four creams."" We all looked at each other, and looked at Lauren, who raised a very displeased eyebrow. No please. No thank you. Just, ""make mine"".

Meanwhile, Helen had taken three (fairly large, and gooey) cookies and *put them on top of her knitting project*. Nancy gasped and reached for the mess of yarn.

&gt;Oh, no, honey - you'll ruin - 

&gt;Um, don't touch my cookies! There are totally enough for everyone.

Nancy pulled her hand back and just blinked at Helen in shock. 

""Helen, I'm really not appreciating the rudeness. These ladies are only trying to point out that you'll ruin your yarn getting food on it."" Lauren's tone was icy. Helen shrugged as though apologizing, her mouth full of the third cookie, but did not bother making eye contact with Sue or Nancy. 

The table had gotten much quieter than usual. Everyone kept their eyes on their knitting. I was genuinely focused for a good thirty minutes before I looked up to give my eyes a break. It was then that I realized that, except for few random broken bits, the only treats left on the table were the tea cakes - because they were too far away for Helen to reach. She had not resumed knitting since the cookies had been put down, and it was clear from all the clean napkins in front of everyone (used in lieu of plates) that nobody else had had a cookie. Her project was visibly dirtied from crumbs and chocolate and butter.

In an effort to ease tension, Maria and Jen attempted to engage Helen in conversation.

&gt;So what do you do for a living, Helen?

&gt;I'm a consultant.

&gt;Oh? What kind of consulting?

&gt;It's more of like ... a brand ambassadorship. I work for this amazing makeup company called Arbonne. You've probably never heard of it, it's super high end.

&gt;Oh, how nice. Isn't that like Mary Kay?

&gt;Uh, no, not at ALL like Mary Kay. It's WAY better.

I'm full blown staring at this rude bitch now. I can't help it. Every word she says is in the snottiest tone imaginable, and to top it off, this has to be the most ass-backwards MLM sales tactic I have ever seen.

&gt;I used to work for this company called Beachbody, but I got so much hate and persecution there. They're really ableist and I felt so attacked. I'm actually suing them right now.

&gt;Oh, wow. That's ... so terrible.

&gt;Oh, yeah, they were really negative. They basically built a company on the basis of telling women they were ugly because they were fat and discriminating against people of size. I mean, seriously? In this day and age.

At this point, Amy had raised her hand to catch Lauren's attention. Amy is a shy young woman with special needs, and has a palsy in her hands which makes it difficult for her to use them. Regardless, she knits and knits very well. However, when Helen spotted Amy's palsied hand in the air, she *freaked out*.

&gt;Ew, oh my god, what is *wrong* with you?

Nobody knew what Helen was talking about and stared in confusion. Helen pointed at Amy with her awful blue talons.

&gt;Your hand is all, like, *retarded*! What **is** that?!

There was no shocked silence this time. There was an *uproar*. In the midst of several very angry women telling her off, Lauren swept a shocked Helen's project into Helen's purse, yanked out her chair, and began forcefully escorting her out. 

&gt;You are absolutely not welcome in this establishment ever again. If you come back, I will call the police and have you removed immediately. How dare you insult my customers. Get out of my shop!

Helen had been stunned, but this woke her up. She started to scream back.

""You are *all* stupid people and you can't handle the truth. You can't handle it coming from someone better looking and better off!"" She hollered other stupid insults and less-than-creative invective, clacking her nails as she allowed herself to be pushed out. Suddenly, she *rushed* back to the table, GRABBED THE PLATE OF TEA CAKES, and practically stampeded out the door, screaming, ""BITCHES!""

Poor Amy was consoled, the knitting hour was extended, and we all angrily carried on with our projects with renewed energy as Lauren told us how very pathetic Helen's first lesson had been. 

&gt;I never imagined she would be *so* rude. I'm very sorry, everyone, for having to endure her. She is absolutely banned.

I'm happy to report that things are back to normal, and we now have a horrible/funny story to tell the new people (who are so far, much nicer).

fatpeoplestories,"Hello friends, I return with a short story about Mother Whale, the time she told me that we HAD to have skim milk NO MATTER WHAT BECAUSE ITS HEALTHY AND SHE SAID SO. 

Cast: 

Me: most likely an early middle-schooler or late elementary-schooler when this occured.

The Whale: my mother, who suckled me at the syrupy teat of her own binge-eating fatlogic-y bullshit for years. 5’11” before her enormous girth squished her down, no real clue as to her weight but most likely 350-400lbs at that time. Raging food addict, narcissist, professional victim, and just all around cruel and manipulative person. 

Let me just preface this story by saying that I hate skim milk. It is a vile, disgusting substance that masquerades as an appropriate beverage or addition to cereal. My mom would always buy it instead of like, any other acceptable milk because it was ""healthy"". It's liquid garbage is what it is. And what good does buying skim milk do you when you eat enough food for 2 draft horses all by yourself?

Scene:

My mother and I are at the breakfast table, on which there is a spread of breakfast foods, mainly cereal and pastries. I am disappointed by the fact that there is only skim milk available, and I try to engage my mother in conversation on this topic. By that I mean I complain.

Mother Whale: We are only having skim milk! It is healthy!

Me: But it's really really gross and no one likes it or wants to drink it. Can't we get 1 or 2% at least?

Mother Whale: NO. IT. IS. HEALTHY.

Mother Whale picks up a croissant the size of Utah and spreads a huge layer of Nutella on it. I stare. Wheels turn in my head. My little child brain senses that something is amiss here. I am smart enough to recognize that mom is full of shit, but not smart enough to realize that I shouldn't call her on it.

Me: But look at what you are eating! What difference will skim milk make at this point? Its not like that's healthy. Why can't the rest of us have milk we like? 

Mother Whale: BECAUSE I SAID SO!!!!!!!!!!!

My authority issues dig a sub-basement to reach a newer, rockier bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Shitlord daughter logic-shames innocent whale. She follows alternative calorie math, wherein over-consumption is magically erased via the application of skim milk, and I live in reality.

&amp;#x200B;",Another (Short) Tale of Mother Whale: why we must have skim milk
fatpeoplestories,"So last week I wrote about Mr Earache and his trials and tribulations of refusing to do his job because he felt his weight was a necessary excuse. As the park season has ended, I feel it is high time for another story. So in subreddit fashion, here’s our cast:

*Mr Earache*: 30-something, fuck knows his weight, at least 400lb if I was to guess, very obnoxious and angry.

*RaRa*: me, 25f, 220lb but in the process of losing weight, a very proud and productive ride operator.

*Preggers*: pregnant ride op, 20f, 140lb ish, can be very sassy when crossed.

*Fluffhead*: ride op from the last story, 21m, 180lb ish, not really in this much but context.

*Bobblehead*: manager, 42m, idk his weight, laid back, doesn’t react unless poked ferociously with a stick.

—

Earache was only trained on a select few rides in our department, because the other rides would require a lot of physical work. As anyone who has worked on rides in some capacity knows , there’s lots of technical components, things that need to be taken on and off the system, buttons to press etc. One of his many, many disabilities he listed is his dyspraxia, which incidentally I also suffer from. Because the dyspraxia affects my coordination, occupational health have deemed one ride in particular to be unsuitable due to the requirement to balance and walk on a moving track. I’m totally fine with this. Earache was not fine with this though. He scree’d about discrimination and how they need to train him. Bobblehead, our manager, then told him if he could do well on the one water ride he was trained on, then he may progress onto the physical ride, and thus a challenge was born.

Unfortunately, this other ride he had to prove himself on was one that I operated. As Earache was an attendent, hé didn’t have permission to sit in the operators cabin, but that didn’t stop him trying. You would do your walk around, come back and he was sat breaking your chair, and then you’d have to put the fan on because the smell was unbearable. On some occasions, he would refuse to move because he was tired, and would get angry and shout about how the relief operator should be doing the checks and not him. The ride cabin wasn’t very big and I needed to access the ride controls and paperwork, but his body would literally block my way. At least though, he couldn’t be any worse whilst the ride was open, right?

On this one particular day, I was the relief operator whilst Preggers was the operator for the day. As the relief, I cover breaks elsewhere before coming back and doing the breaks for the two staff on the ride in question. I was covering a break and chilling out when I get a phone call from Preggers:

“God, RaRa you need to come back! He’s driving me absolutely insane!”

I inform her I’ll probably be another 45 minutes yet and to contact management if she needed any assistance. A minute later I hear her call Bobblehead over the radio for him to come down so I assume the issue, whatever it was, was being dealt with. I carry on with my breaks and try not to think about having to talk to Earache. 

Then the time comes and I head back to the ride. Because Preggers is, well, pregnant, she gets first pick of the break she has, and unsurprisingly she wanted to go the millisecond I walked through the gate. Earache is very unhappy and starts shouting at me that he needs his break right now, to which Preggers shouts at him back, in front of all the guests waiting to ride. As she has clearly reached the end of her tether in the space of an hour, I take over immediately and she shuffles off as fast as her little legs will carry her. I realise that I had forgotten to ask why she had called Bobblehead down. It wouldn’t take long to discover why.

Earache immediately leaves his post and walks towards his cabin. I stop the ride, which is busy, and tell him he needs to go back. 

Me: please go back to your post. We need to keep the ride going, it’s busy.

Earache: no! It’s ridiculous! People keep asking muh where to go, the sun is too hot and I’m getting hit with water! Preggers has called managers on muh, she’s discriminating! 

Me, flatly: stand there and do your job please. Do you want the umbrella for the sun?

Earache: OBVIOUSLY YES. This is ridiculous!!

Earache slowly shuffles back to his post after I pass him the massive rainproof brolly provided for a wet day. I watch on as he refuses to help guests get out of the ride and refuses to speak to them. As the ride is a water ride, you can get eachother wet, and if you’re not careful attending on the ride, you can easily get wet too. 

A young family comes into the station and there’s a boy about 8 years old who is clearly having the time of his life. He decides to be cheeky and shoot water at Earache. Earaches response? With a face fir for the Incredible Hulk, he grabs his bottle of water and *tips the contents over the boys head*. There was a silence as I sat there mortified. The parents were visibly furious. The boy starts crying. I have to deal with an angry family and go through the hassle of calling Bobblehead back to try and resolve things.

At the end of the shift, Earache tells me and Preggers how he thinks it won’t be long before they move him. Preggers responds that it won’t be long before they move him off the rides altogether.",Obnoxious Ham at a Theme Park part 2: I Don’t Want to Get Wet!
fatpeoplestories,"Every victory has it's consequences. For me i'd have rather not gotten the victory had i known the consequences.

After EEB's room was seen by my dad he would randomly go to ""check on"" EEB and everytime he'd become angry and disgusted. He couldn't take knowing my brother lived in that kind of filth. Eventually just walking past EEB's room pissed him off, because the smell started coming through.

My mom, not liking my dad being angry, decided she'd clean EEB's room. My mom with a horribly bad back and messed up arm. I caught her bent over picking up trash in his room when i came home from school, I immediately asked her what she was doing and she explained the situation. I stopped her from continuing, but i knew if it wasn't done she'd just do it anyway.

I cleaned his room. It wasn't the first time i had cleaned one of my brothers' rooms. Usually  it was a punishment though. 

The cleaning took hours and i had to leave many times so i wouldn't throw up. I dismantled his soda towers around his bed and his mounds of garbage. There was almost 10 liters of soda left in the cans in his room. It took so many garbage bags. I found some interestung stuff: almost an entire dish set, many broken cups, one of my stuffed animals (covered in spilled soda and random food waste), my pillow, a lot of my dad's clothes, and a LOT of my socks now completely ruined.

When i was all done i doused the whole room in febreeze, closed the door, and called it a day.

Later when EEB came home I got a little worried he'd throw a fit that i had been in his room, but no such reaction. In fact there was no reaction at all. He went into his room, closed the door, and didn't come out till dinner. My mom mentioned me cleaning his room and the response was ""i noticed"" when she said something like ""aren't you gonna say thank you?"" He said ""i didn't ask her to do it, why should i be grateful?"" I was a bit at a loss. I understand what he means, but at the same time it kind of bothered me.

My dad saw how his room looked and was content. And a month later i had to do it all over again. Because EEB couldn't keep his room clean to save his life. I tried to get out of it, but then my mom would try to do it or would actually do it and I'd feel bad. When my mom told EEB she'd hurt her back cleaning his room he said ""that was dumb, why didn't  you have Mymass do it?"" And she said something like ""your little sister shouldn't have to clean your room"" he said that we didn't have to clean his room and that he doesn't even care if it's clean. So after that i convinced my mom to leave it alone for awhile.

But my dad started looking in EEB's room and it was getting worse and worse and my dad was getting angrier and angrier. So after a while I sucked it up and cleaned the room. That day EEB came home and at dinner said something like ""i was wondering when you'd clean up, it was starting to get pretty bad. I was honestly about to say something."" After that me and my mom didn't touch his room again till we moved and I had to clean his room and basically the entire house by myself (his room was literally the only room he had to clean)",My Ever Expanding Brother: what happend after he got in trouble
fatpeoplestories,"This is the rest of Mr. Small’s story, as far as I know it. Part 1, in which Mr. Small vomits a buffet’s worth of food at dinner, is here: https://bit.ly/2CV828x  

It has been rightly asked why Mr. Small was allowed to order so much food considering his substantial girth. Basically, as servers we were supposed to let the residents order whatever they were willing to pay for, since this was supposed to be restaurant-style dining. We didn’t really have a procedure for residents who ordered enough food for a family of 4, because it had never happened before. In fact, usually it was harder to get the residents to eat enough, so if they asked for a burger and ice cream, we’d happily comply. But Mr. Small took full advantage of the accommodating restaurant staff, and eventually there had to be a special procedure for dealing with him. We were told to deny him extra portions because his family was concerned that he was getting fatter and spending all his money on food. We had to basically tell them it wasn’t the food prices that were draining his wallet, it was the fact that he ate 6 square meals a day. 

Well, after being denied extra food at the restaurant, Mr. Small took to stealing food. Sometimes I would work at a deli-style counter adjacent to the restaurant, and Mr. Small, thinking he was the cleverest ham to ever exist, would come over and start talking to me about the weather or today’s sports game. He thought I couldn’t see him pocketing granola bars or candy out of the baskets by the counter. Then he would waddle away as quickly as possible before I could say much about it. What he didn’t realize was that I just took note of everything he stole, rang it up to his account after he left, then reported it to my boss. 

When he was called on stealing from the deli counter, Mr. Small began to be caught pilfering the refrigerators of the community kitchen on the assisted living floor late at night. These community kitchens were meant to make assisted living seem more like home, and residents and staff could go there to get snacks if they wanted. Multiple times the snacks would mysteriously disappear after Mr. Small had been lurking about the kitchens at night. 

It seemed there was nothing the staff could do to prevent Mr. Small from eating massive amounts. Eventually, this combined with complaints from female staff about how creepy he was reached a tipping point. He was moved to an apartment on the locked-down memory care unit, where his meals would be more closely monitored and he couldn’t wander the halls at night or pinch snacks from the deli counter. He didn’t have dementia, but it was the only place he could be properly dealt with. 

And that is the story of how a hamplanet by the name of Mr. Small became the only non-dementia patient on the dementia floor, because his creepiness and lack of self-control around food made it impossible to care for him anywhere else.

I never saw Mr. Small again after that, but I had to admit I was relieved to not have to deal with him anymore. I only pity the people who do. 
",The Decline and Fall of Mr. Small
fatpeoplestories,"In my house everyone has their own favorite something, whether it be ice cream, cereal, poptarts,  chips, ect. Everyone has ""their"" snack. This also goes for soda, I was heavily caffeine dependent and still kind of am. Soda and snacks were kept in the pantry and fridge like everything else. 

It was basically an unwritten rule that if it wasn't bought for you, don't touch it. I knew things were bought for me and I would still ask 4-5 times if I could open it as a kid, because I always felt guilty opening a new bag or box of something. My ever expanding brother (EEB) didn't feel that way.

To EEB, everything in the pantry and fridge was fair game. The last slice of my dad's favorite pie? Better eat 3/4ths of it from the middle and leave the crust, so I can say I left him some. My oldest brother's favorite ice cream? Well he bought it two days ago and hasn't eaten any yet, he must not like it. Left overs? First come first served. Your leftover take out/doggy bag? Should have labeled it. Your LABELED ANYTHING? I didn't see it and what kind of psycho labels food? But the hell to pay if you ate his food? Enormous. In general people would just be like ""really dude? Are you serious?"" And hope it would make him stop (it didn't)

This all came to a head when my all time favorite chips were all but discontinued (you can buy them online but they are hella expensive) . There was one gas station that was a half hour drive from my dad's work in the opposite direction of my house (an hour drive home already) that had the chips, so I'd get them for special occasions like holidays. Well my dad told me that that gas station stopped stocking them and while sad I was expecting it. What I wasn't  expecting was my dad bought the last 3 bags they had and gave them to me as a birthday present. 

I was ecstatic. I ate one bag right away. I ate another on a bad day. Then on a randomly nice day I decided to have my last bag of my discontinued chips. The last bag I would ever eat of them. I went to the pantry and was thinking about what show or movie I would watch while eating them. I was really really excited and it was a bit bittersweet, but i was determined to enjoy them knowing they would be my last. When I got to the pantry to grab my chips?... they weren't there. I looked and looked and looked. I checked my room and the living room. Then I got a sick feeling in my stomach. (You know where this is going)

I went to EEB's room, his was the closest to the kitchen. He wasn't home because he was working part-time at a local store, so I just went in. His room smelled disgusting, there were cans piled high all around his bed and trash all over the place. It smelled like B.O. and rotten garbage and stale soda. I walked in, cringing at the sound of walking on trash. Turned on the light and looked around for a specific piece of plastic... and I found it.

I carefully managed to get across his room to the bag of my beloved chips. The bag looked full, so I had hope he hadn't gotten to them yet and was just saving them for later. I grabbed the bag and the first thing I noticed was it WAS full the second thing was that it was open. The third on closer inspection was that the chips were horrendous stale.

He opened my birthday present bag of chips, my discontinued favorite bag of chips, tried a few, decided he didn't like them, and just tossed them to the side of his room. While there I also noticed there was at least 12 unopened sodas just laying around and many many more opened and wasted bags of chips most of which were my various favorite flavors (some of which I asked for specifically because he hates the flavor). To say I was mad was an understatement.

I texted my dad what had happened and what I found, little did I know that it would cause me more problems down the line. EEB had an earful when he came home. He kept trying to use the ""I just came home from work"" excuse to deflect then tried to yell about me being in his room (he went in my room without permission all the time and even broke some of my favorite things while drunk and belligerent, not even on purpose just by being an idiot) which didn't really fly. Eventually he just said that I had left them there so long that he figured it was fair game and that chips were so cheap he never bothered trying to save any. (Yeah when you don't buy them they're cheap as hell) 

My parents basically gave me permission to keep my chips/snacks/poptarts/soda/anything food related in my room and said if he wanted chips to ask for them. It wasn't like he didn't have his own food that was *his*. The thing with him is what's his is his and what's yours is his and if he doesn't get it he will whine.

The reason he didn't ask for chips specifically though is because he knew if he asked for all the snacks he wanted my parents would have laughed in his face, stealing my snacks was the only way for him to get a fraction of the amount of snacks he actually wanted. He also complained that my parents would buy me more snacks than they bought for him so he would run out faster and therefore *needed* to steal mine. The thing was that he'd leave his snacks out and they'd go bad and I was getting more because I kept running out from him stealing them. I was going through 3+ bags of chips a week when I only ate like 1 maybe a bit of the second bag, but I was ALWAYS out of snacks by the end of the week. 

I thought my mom was getting into them (which she did sometimes) but like, my parents paid for them so I didn't mind.

Edit: he went in my room without permission all the time, as in would come in without knocking at any hour he knew i was there (including like 3AM when i had school the next day). He did it to drunkenly rant at me or ask me for something. It frustrated me that he acted like i broke a rule when he never has my permission to go in my room and does anyway. ",My ever expanding brother: that time he stole my food and actually got in trouble.
fatpeoplestories,"My brother is about 5 years older than me. The middle brat of 3. Planet in the making. I haven't seen him since he was well over 300lbs at 5'10, but he's been ""bigger"" almost my entire life. The closest he's ever been to a healthy weight was when he basically was bulimic and only eating hard-boiled eggs other than that. He was definitely still over weight then (it takes time to burn 100 lbs), but he looks back fondly with hate in his heart for his family (shitty older brother but he blames everyone) that still told him he was overweight when clearly he was an Adonis.

My brother was always chubby, always complaining about his weight, always eating, always complaining  there wasn't enough to eat. He would say things weren't fair. That was his favorite thing.

""Oldest sibling is skinnier than me even though we eat the same and weigh almost the same, THAT'S NOT FAIR!"" Oldest sibling didn't eat as much as him, exercised more, weighed considerably less than him and was a fair amount taller.

""Mymass eats as much as me and she's tiny, THAT'S  NOT FAIR!"" I didn't eat as much as him and I exercised much more than him.

fatpeoplestories,"In college I worked in a nursing home restaurant/dining room. I was basically a server, but almost all my customers were residents. The place had over 500 residents, but the fattest one I ever knew was named Mr. Small (I shit you not). He had to be at least 450 pounds. Mr. Small was younger than most of the residents by a good 20 years; he was in the nursing home not because of old age but because his massive size made it too hard for him to care for himself, and because his family knew he couldn’t self-regulate when it came to food if he lived on his own. 

However, even nursing homes try to afford the residents as much independence as possible, and independence meant Mr. Small was relatively free to remain a massive black hole engulfing all nearby food items. Whenever he would come into the restaurant, all the servers knew he would be ordering multiple appetizers, at least one entree, dessert, and soda. (This was a pretty high-end place so the main restaurant area functioned like any other restaurant with a full menu.) If our soup of the day was one of his favorites, he would order 4-5 full-size bowls of it (not the normal cup that most people order as an appetizer) before his main entree. He would also ask for double portions of many things.

As an aside, Mr. Small was also one of the creepiest residents. He was amiable, but the way he would stare at the female staff was rivaled only by the way he stared at fried chicken. That is to say, he practically salivated. He would always stare at my boobs while ordering his food or while I poured his coffee. He once asked another coworker to come up to his room after she was off. Another coworker, rest her soul, was unexpectedly pulled into a hug by Mr. Small, thus being forced to make contact with his rolls and B.O. Sometimes he would hand me his money, and when I reached out to take it it he would wrap his limp, doughy sausage fingers around my hand and hold it there until I yanked it away. 

Mr. Small also reeked to high heaven. I made a habit of subtly holding my breath whenever I was taking his order, because the wall of stink that emanated off of him was enough to choke you. I guess when you have the circumference of a small planet, you have a hard time showering, and Mr. Small would wait until the aides forced him to submit to a sponge bath, or until the restaurant manager told him he couldn’t come back until he smelled better. 

I remember one time he came down to the restaurant, he must not have been feeling well but didn’t let that get in the way of him and a massive plate of deep fried shrimp, fries, soda, and a bowl of chili. Half way through the meal, he erupted like a vomit geiser, spewing chunks across the table. Honestly guys, I have NEVER seen a human produce that much vomit. If I had doubted his stomach capacity before, I didn’t after seeing the contents emptied out across a 4-foot radius.

The residents nearby were so disgusted they got up and left, and I felt so sorry for them that I took their meals off their tab. Mr. Small just sat at the table with gallons of vomit in front of him, dripping off his various dinner plates. Half-digested shrimp floated next to the uneaten shrimp that was left on his dinner plate. Trying not to gag, I approached him to ask if he was okay and if I should call for someone. He said he was fine, and he didn’t want me to call anyone, but could he have another coke? 

I was kind of shocked that he could create a disaster of that scale and be so nonchalant and want to keep sitting there drinking cokes, but I figured he wanted to get the taste out of his mouth so I got him a coke. I ignored his request not to call anyone and called an aide. Another server and I were tasked with cleaning up the Hindenburg Disaster 2.0 (Mr. Small was the blimp and the vomit was the disaster). We put on plastic parkas and aprons, 3 pairs of gloves, and set about scrubbing everything in the vicinity for what was to be the worst night of work I’ve ever had. In the end, our supervisor gave us permission to throw away everything on the table - dishes, linens, even the table number. It was too late to save anything. It all had to be triple bagged and sent immediately to hell where it belonged. 

There’s more to tell about Mr. Small and his food stealing ways, but this is already way too long, so that will follow in another post. ",Mr. Small the Vomit Geyser

fatpeoplestories,"As I started recently, this is a series about a long-lost cousin I didn't know but fate positioned us to living in the same city far from the rest of the family, and I hoped it would work out well. Spoiler alert: It didn't.   
 

[So when I left off](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/9rh5f9/cousin_carnie_part_1/), she and I hadn't known each other too many months. We'd been working at the same hotel together, and I was learning what a horrible coworker she was. When she decided she wanted to switch shifts with me and push me to working overnights, I didn't have to get even with her. She screwed herself over.  
 

I mentioned before that sometimes guests would want extra towels, etc. brought to their rooms. We got more of those requests on evening shift than overnights.  From late afternoon until morning, only one person would be working the desk (and all housekeeping and maintenance had left for the day), so the desk clerk on duty would have to lock up the desk area and run them the items, but it was no big deal; I never had a problem with it. It wasn't a big hotel and we could step away from the desk for a few minutes as needed and our absence would hardly be noticed.   


Apparently, Carnie refused to bring the items to guests and instead would always tell them they had to come to her because ""I'm not allowed to leave the desk."" This lead to a fair number of complaints, especially because I used to bring them items all the time, so they didn't believe the not-allowed-to-leave-the-desk excuse. (We had a lot of business travelers who were often repeat customers.) Apparently I'd ""spoiled"" them. You know, it had literally never occurred to me to tell a guest, ""Come get the shit yourself; I ain't leaving the desk!"" But she had no problem doing that.  


It didn't take long for the manager to get somewhat fed up about the complaints and she lectured Carnie about doing everything she could to accommodate the guests. Carnie begrudgingly started doing it but absolutely refused to take anything to guests on the second floor (there was no elevator) because she claimed to have bad knees and have trouble with stairs. Guests on the second floor were not happy that she wouldn't provide delivery service, so some complaints continued.  
   
The evening desk clerk was also supposed to lock up the (outdoor) pool area at 10pm (it might have been 9pm during the week), but in the beginning she simply refused to do it (using the can't-leave-the-desk excuse) so then I would have to do it when I arrived at 11pm every night, and I got to kick people out of the pool. So there were also some complaints from other guests about noisy people in the pool area after 9 or 10pm.  After the manager told Carnie she couldn’t use the can't-leave-the-desk excuse anymore, she would sometimes lock up the pool area, but not always. I suspected the nights she didn't lock it up were the nights that people were there because she was too timid to kick people out, and so the complaints about loud people by the pool after 10pm continued as well.  


Worse, Carnie was really bad with computers. The cheap computer system this hotel used was an old DOS based program, it was fairly simple to learn and use, and she'd worked there longer than I had. You think she'd know what she was doing, but sadly no. She was always messing things up. Her excuse was ""Well, I'm just not good with computers. Tee hee hee.""  I get that not everyone is great with computers, but it was part of her *job* to learn this very basic program. I'm sure she'd made some of these mistakes when she'd been working overnights, too, but once she was working evening shift, there were more opportunities for her to make mistakes, and then her mistakes would screw up my job.  


One night I checked someone into a room at about 1am, only to have the person walk into the room and find someone else sleeping in that room! Then I had two *very* irate guests screaming at *me*, one on the phone and one in my face. Turns out, Carnie had checked someone into Room 204 but put them in the computer as Room 206 so that Room 204 looked like an *available* room when I went to check the next guest in and I sent him to the wrong room. NOT COOL.   
 

Other times she would move someone from one room to another (say the A/C wasn't working in Room 102) and then not mark Room 102 as Out of Order or as Dirty (guess always mess up the bed before deciding the room is unacceptable! lol). So then I'd check the next guest into Room 102 and an angry customer yelling at me that that room I'd checked them into looked like someone had been sleeping in it already or that the AC is not working and how dare I not know what I'm doing?? Even if I wanted to cover up for her (I didn't), I had to let the manager know she'd likely be getting complaints from those guests in the morning.    
 

The Best Part, and more relevant to this sub: One day there was a notice posted that employees could no longer eat food at the desk or in the breakfast area or anywhere in view of guests. There really wasn't a break room, but there was an area behind the front desk wall where the fridge and freezer were where we would prepare the breakfast items for the morning breakfast buffet, and we were told we could eat our meals in that area as long as we followed typical food-handling rules. However, there wasn't a table or any place to sit in that area. It didn't bother me much because I didn't eat much on my shift – I usually ate before and after work. Occasionally I'd have a little snack, but if I had to go back into that area to eat my snack, so be it. It was mildly inconvenient, but I didn't see a point in making a fuss.  


Carnie fussed and fussed. She said it was terribly unfair because there was nowhere to *sit* while eating and she was convinced that it's *bad*  for you to stand while eating. Like UNHEALTHY. (Which I found *hilarious* because she ate nothing but fast food, so it's not like health was her #1 concern when it came to mealtimes.) She said she *couldn't* eat before her shift because she had to come to work directly from her other job, so she HAD to eat while at work and felt persecuted by the new rule.   


Out of morbid curiosity, one morning when the manager came in, I asked her, ""Okay, what's with the new rule, anyway?"" I was sure it would have something to do with Carnie, and was not disappointed. Apparently the owner had shown up one evening (or maybe he was just going over the security footage? He didn't come by during second or third shift) and, according to the manager, had seen Carnie and her husband eating dinner in the breakfast area. The owner was disgusted by their terrible table manners and never wanted a guest to see that. So because they apparently ate like hogs at a trough, all of us were exiled to the back room to eat.  (I never once ate a meal with Carnie so I can't confirm her table habits.)  


So apparently, the owner and management had a few problems with her.  


Finally, one afternoon I got a call at 2:30pm asking if I could be to work at 3pm to work the evening shift instead of my usual overnight shift, and while mildly irritated, but I didn't have other plans, so I said yes. I figured Carnie had called out of work which she did from time to time, and then they'd get the relief overnight gal to cover my overnight shift. I was told it was okay if I was a few minutes late, what with the short notice and all. When I arrived, there was a lot going on in the lobby, as a couple of maintenance people were fixing something and there was a group of guests lingering around waiting to be checked in, so I slipped by everyone and went around to behind the desk where the manager was checking the group in. When they had their room keys, some of them were still milling about near the desk talking before heading to their rooms. The manager turned to me and thanked me for coming in and said, ""We had to fire Carnie when she came in, you know."" Between all the screw-ups with the computer, arriving late often enough to become a problem (because of rushing from her other job to this one), the customer complaints, the laziness and apparently the fact that the owner couldn't get over how ""gross"" her eating habits were (to this day I wish I'd begged the manager to show me the video, since I'm dying of curiosity to know if he was over-reacting or if it was really *that* bad), they just decided she was too much trouble to keep. It was a small business, so most worker protections don't apply they could fire her for just about any reason, anyway.  
 

Part of me felt bad for her, but part of me was relieved since I was really frustrated with her, too, at that point. So I went to check the laundry and when I got back to the desk, the manager said, ""I don't know what to do about Carnie!"" Confused, I didn't know what she meant. I said, ""Well, you fired her, so…?"" – so what else is there to do, right? And she replied, ""Yes, but she won't *leave*. She's still sitting over there crying and I don't know what to do!""  
 

I hadn't seen her sitting in the lobby area on the sofa crying because of the people and commotion in the lobby. But there she was, sobbing on the sofa.  
 

Now I was torn. I sort of thought she deserved it, but she was still a ""friend"" and relative, so I went over and tried to comfort her. The group was drifting out of the lobby finally, so I asked her what happened and I told her how sorry I was. She just kept sobbing, ""I don't understand! I don't understand! They won't explain to me why they did this!"" I was flabbergasted – did the manager really not give her a reason, or had she, and Carnie just couldn’t process it? And what was I supposed to say. ""Well, Carnie, I mean, you were *terrible* at your job""?  Now it was my turn to be too cowardly, so I didn't say it.  


 Instead I said, ""I know, this is really unfair."" She agreed, saying she'd worked there for two years; if they had a problem they should have said something sooner!! ""This is just like when I was fired from Holiday Inn!"" she cried. Oh, they fired you, too, huh?  Well, now I feel less bad. I was half tempted to call Holiday Inn and get the scoop on how bad she'd been over there!!  


By that point I'd gotten sick of graveyard shift, so I'd been looking for new jobs and left the hotel not long after that when I found a better job in my career field, but my Carnie stories were only beginning. ",Cousin Carnie Part 2
fatpeoplestories,"Its time for the finale of the hammy tales and seeing as my date cancelled tonight at the last minute, i have nothing better to do than have a drink and tell strangers on the internet about some guy i lived with years ago. If you've read the other two chapters of Hammy [(1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/9r30g7/hammy_destroyer_of_toilets/) ([2](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/9rdn2r/hammy_part_deux_the_hamburglar/)) you might wonder if anything could be solved just by talking to him, maybe an adult sit down, nice cup of tea, some chocolate digestives and deal with it like functioning members of society? I hope this chapter gives a little explanation on how we just couldn't or just didn't want to talk to him.

* Me/Kimjoe: dashing male lead in this story, Fit af, just out of a 4 year long relationship and getting into my hoe phase.
* Victim: Poor girl shared a course and tutor with Hammy, not a fan of him, Knows some people.
* Hammy: villain lumbering tower of bitter jealousy, mansplainer, on course with Victim, shared a single statistics module with me.
* Mama Ham:sweet lady, looks like the typical housewife (bit overweight but not ungodly huge), Helicopter mum?
* Chinny: comes from a wine region in a wine country, likes wine, likes arguing after drinking wine.

At the start i had some hope for Hammy, i hoped we could be buddies we were neighbours and he even shared a single module with me but things just wouldn't work out. Flash back to moving in Saturday my parents drop me off outside with my bags first thing in the morning and leave me, so i wait for everyone else to arrive and help move them in. All the girls in the flat arrive quite quickly, but we are still left with one empty room, the day passes and still no sign of him so we introduce ourselves and get drunk as hell with all the neighbouring flats. Roll on Sunday evening i feel the floor shake, cue hammy squeezing through the door puffing and panting (lived on the 3rd floor) carrying a bag full of food and a gaming console. I hold a hand out to introduce my self, he looks me up and down then stares at me like i spat on him, his mother and his grandmother, eventually he grunts and mumbles Hammy. At this point his Mama Ham turns up doting on him unpacking his entire luggage, food supplies and kitchen wares, i turn on the sweet talk even offer to help out while i chat away with his mother. After promising to take care of him, make sure he does well on our shared class, make sure he doesn't get too drunk and maybe introduce him to some girls its time for her to leave. What was her precious boy doing this whole time you ask? Setting up his WiFi and booting up his console. I offer the invitation to come out and have a few drinks with a bunch of people, maybe make some friends and to my surprise he accepts so we get dressed grab the rest of the flat and go.

Now i don't claim to be a fashion icon but Hammy looked a bit off in his outfit going for a modern punkrock look i guess or angsty teen on tumblr, Black boots, black boot-cut jeans, a weathered and aged black Metallica t shirt and to top it off a much to small black leather jacket. I'm not going to be fattist and say he looked terrible because he's carrying half a bakery in his muffin top but he just looked wrong like nothing fit together properly and he acted odder than normal, like he was trying to be someone else. So we rock up, a crate of beer in my hands, nothing in Hammy's, so being nice i offer to share, free food and drinks always go down a treat and he accepts immediately. The night gets started and people trickle in and out constantly, i work my way around the room and spot Hammy perched in the brooding in the corner, i was worried about him maybe he's shy, maybe he feels uncomfortable around all these new people, maybe he feels like the odd one out and doesn't know how to introduce himself. That was until i saw his eyes, leering at the group of girls chatting across the room who happen to be very made up and dressed up, if they could i'm sure his eyes could have burnt their clothes straight off. I lose all sympathy. The creep factor increases.

Chinny now wine drunk must have noticed his self imposed exile but not where his eyes where pointing, so she decided to have a chat over another glass of wine, maybe help bring him out of his shell a little bit. Im guessing theres a pick up tactic which involves looking dark/dumb, mysterious/miserable, brooding/pathetic out there somewhere. To Hammy it looks like the pick up artist's guide was working out for him, so it was time to build himself up a bit and neg chinny down, but what could he use against her, his looks were nonexistent compared to hers so he used what was at hand. Yep he tried to chat up his own flatmate with a conversation about drinks, unless you are a suave and handsome wine expert this has very little sex appeal. (In the UK there are very strict unofficial rules on dating house/flatmates, its practically illegal socially, not sure what its like overseas let me know how it is.) To start with he bragged about how his very free and ice cold beer was cheap tasting, classless and any other pretentious garbage you can spit out, how good wines he knows are much more enjoyable, this is when he fucked up. The pretend Wine connoisseur challenged a self trained wine expert, i missed the bulk of the conversation and Chinny was too drunk to remember half of it but he dug himself a hole mansplaining grape stuff and basically smeared shit all over Chinny's hometown and their wine. Cue him being very publicly destroyed, excusing himself to the toilet and never coming back. 

Turns out all the girls also figured that he was staring straight at their bums, even catching him multiple times but just being too polite to tell him to do one. This still wasn't enough for everyone to give up on him, girls included we even invited him practically every week but it wasn't his ""scene"" no matter what was going on. We invited him to clubs, pubs, bars, concerts and even game nights.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward about 6-7 weeks, classes have started and everyone has started tutorial sessions with classes anywhere from 3 to 20 something people. This generally gives people a chance to interact more and help each other out, it's normally a good system unless you get stuck with the wrong people. One day Chinny did everything but break my door down to spread some hot gossip.

""Hammy has a girl around"" 

""What?""

""There is a girl in our kitchen and Hammy is cooking for her!""

Being a lover of gossip and about as subtle as a bat to the head i stride straight on in, i see the victim sat in the corner backed up against the wall, Hammy bent over, crack out as he loads some frozen pizzas into the oven. I know trouble when i see it and love being a part of it if it's entertaining, so i slide my butt into a seat opposite the poor girl and start my usual chatting, turns out we come from the same town near enough even have some mutual friends including my ex girlfriend strangely enough. Hammy no like. He plonks his over sized arse down at the end of the table because he's too wide to fit at the table next to her, constantly interrupting mid sentence trying to be funny with a quip or a joke in poor taste, oddly enough no one laughs, it almost looks like he might rage out, he's at critical point when the timer goes, off all rage dissipates because honestly no one can eat a pizza angrily. Two family sized pizzas flop onto the table and Hammy vaguely slices them up into pieces, the victim takes a slice to be polite and i ask for a slice because its about 1pm and i skipped breakfast. His eyes shoot daggers at me but he must really want to impress this girl with his generosity so he agrees begrudgingly. The conversation picks up from were we left off and heads towards my ex girlfriend somehow (i think they were in a choir or something) and i explain that we split, Hammy gets anxious and desperately steers the conversation away from this for obvious reasons. 

Eventually enough time passes that the victim can politely leave or it took her time to come up with a usable excuse i'm not sure, i stay seated and wave our guest away while Hammy walks her to the door and tries an awkward hug and Goodbye promising to message her later. Excitement over i get up to head back to my room and bump into Hammy forming a human roadblock in the hallway.

""You can't even let me get one girl"" he growls at me.

""What?"" 

""You basically have a new slag in every weekend and i have to deal with that, but you just have to keep hinting how fucking single you are now to get at your ex"" 

I'm not finding it so funny anymore, i hate the word slag with a passion and i was honestly not trying to get with my ex's choir buddy from 10 years ago.

""Firstly not every weekend and secondly she's not my type"" 

i reply getting a bit madder with each word coming out of my mouth.

""Just because you look good doesn't mean you can treat people like shit and embarrass them in front of their girl""

I take the compliment and get ready to reply but Chinny decides to stop eavesdropping and break it up between us before i drop some truth bombs, sending Hammy back to his chamber of isolation. Not before he collected the remains of the two family sized pizzas obviously.

 In the next few weeks the toilet incident occurred part one this series followed by part 2. Hammy became almost completely non verbal towards me for the remainder of his stay choosing to reply in grunts or just to ignore me completely. Hammy stopped attending his tutorials. The victim recovered and i met her on nights out and never slept with her funnily enough. (obviously for Hammy's sake)

&amp;#x200B;

Thus the Hammy trilogy comes to its end, its been good reminiscing and getting back to writing for fun, i may have more stories from an earlier point in my life about a guy that i was involved in scouts (cool i know) with, but before i start writing that i'll have to talk to some of the other people involved so i can get the whole story. 

Thanks for reading.",Hammy: Mr steal yo Girl
fatpeoplestories,"This is just a short tale from last summer, in between university years during the summer break i work for an outdoor activity center. One of the services my workplace provides is hiring out portable activities for events like festivals or local council initiatives which are a massive ball-ache but they pay well so i always go anyways. This particular event was a council ran event in the center of a pretty large town completely free for anyone to use. I was running a zip-line (pretty cool i know) which has 3 positions to work in: harnessing (enough said) Top position (Clipping people in and sending them down) and catching (manually unclipping, Super hard work) what makes this a fps is the weight guideline on the zip-line generally turn away anyone over 18 stone(250ibs) but thats only if people admit to being over the limit. Lets get into it.

Me/Kimjoe: Harnessing, hate children, loves money so needs work, spiteful

Mama June: Meat monster, has that red angry face permanently, refuses to let her weight hold her back, looks like honey boo boos mum on a bad day.

Imagine the scene you're busy crouched down harnessing up some screaming children, sending them off to have fun whilst you slave for a 12 hour shift. Suddenly the sun is eclipsed, you look up straight under the folds of her 3 chins. Shit. I harness up the kid she shoves in front of me and send him on his way everything's fine right? Nope not with my luck 

""Adults can go on too""

It's not a question, barely a sentence at that but i get her point she wants to go on at this special event **for the children,** okay no biggie i can deal with that lots of people do that. Its at this moment that i really take a look at her, how do you tell someone that they're too fat to go on? In a polite way of course. I choose to mention the weight and health restrictions in a monotone matter of fact way hoping she will catch a hint, nope no chance. I suck it up and ask to her face.

""Excuse me are you over 18 stone miss""

She Blusters turning redder somehow and snaps back in that awful can i speak to your manager tone that all miserable entitled scum have.

""Of course i'm under, you cant just ask people stuff like that. You cant just kick me off, we've been queuing for ages to go on"" 

3 strikes against her already

Strike 1: Don't tell me Porkie Pies Miss Piggy (lies) 

Strike 2: I can ask and i can kick you out of the line anytime i want. 

Strike 3: I just don't like your tone.

So i decide to take a little bit of revenge the only way i know how, first i squeeze and cram her into a harness. The end result looking like a pork loin tied up a little too tight with the straps digging in across her legs and chest. With Mama June looking a mess in public, phase 1 was complete. I swap positions with my coworker up top and say a prayer for the people who have to catch her. When it was her turn to be clipped in up top and she lumbers up the very shaky stairs, i intentionally set the strap too high so she hangs a few inches higher than she should, phase 2 complete.

She launches off the platform once i give her the go ahead the supports and anchors shake i wonder if the zip wire will snap. luckily it holds together and she finishes her ride dangling just a few inches of of the floor. Now if anyone has ever hung about in a harness its not great at the best of times, if anyone has ever hung out in a (intentionally) poorly fitted harness its sucks big time. Mama June got the great experience hung up like a cow in a butchers shop. I got a prime spectator seat to the attempts to pull her down, no one able being able to get any leverage due to her extreme size, it eventually took 3 people to get her off compared to the usual 1. Justice has been served, my justice that is.

&amp;#x200B;

Rude Ham lies about her weight and pays the price.

Quick edit/clarification. It was petty revenge of course I accept that but in no way was it a health hazard. Our harnesses are full body with straps across the shoulders, chest, waist and legs with fatter people they tend to have more give and it's possible to squeeze into the harness and bulge out of the straps. Nothing harmful other than a bit of embarrassment. Setting her up higher on the clip is technically safer as her excess weight would pull her lower and closer to the ground much more dangerous than a bit of embarrassment. The only people I hurt are probably my coworkers. ",You must be this skinny to ride
fatpeoplestories,"Many years ago my friend had a horrible friend/roommate who was obnoxious and full of fat logic. I enjoyed hearing the crazy antics of the rommie, but sometimes I thought, ""Wait, no one can be this bad!"" I didn't think my friend was lying, but the stories were pretty hard to believe. What kind of person could behave like this?  Then I met my own version of the same person, right down to the obnoxious fake giggle!  
 

I did not grow up near my Cousin Carnie - she is a somewhat distant cousin who grew up in a neighboring state from me. She and I were the same age, though, so I'd heard a little bit about her growing up, but then didn't meet her until we were nearly 40 years old.    
 

Through some weird twist of fate, we both ended up living in the same town in a distant state from where we grew up, and I only found out she lived here in town because my mother found out through family gossip.  Mom felt that I MUST go meet up with her. Oddly curious, I decided to go for it. My husband and I were pretty much empty nesters at the time, and she had no kids and her step-kids weren't around. I hoped they might be nice couple to hang out with, since none of us would have little kids underfoot.  


First thing I noticed was that she and her husband, Harry, are both obese. Not morbidly, yet, but getting there. My husband and I are both veterans, we like to be active, eat somewhat healthy and take care of ourselves. We enjoy being outdoors and going hiking, biking, going to festivals or participating in charity walks/fun runs. We have a lot of energy.  Unsurprisingly, I'd quickly find out that Carnie and Harry are both allergic to any and all physical activity. They were very much *indoor* people – all weather seems to offend them and they are always ""too hot"" or ""too cold"" unless sitting in front of an A/C in the summer months or a heater in the winter months. Additionally, I like cooking and experimenting with all kinds of different recipes and cuisines, and I particularly enjoy incorporating a lot of vegetables into my meals.  Carnie and Harry eat exclusively fast food and particularly hate all vegetables except French fries or ketchup. They were walking, talking stereotypes - even here I'm not sure you'd believe I'm not exaggerating about them.  
I have several stories about her and I guess I'll start at the beginning and work my way up to some of the better stories. My first story about her is about what an *amazing* coworker she is.

  
When I first met her I was between jobs and looking for something in my career field. While talking to my newfound cousin, the topic of where I work came up and I admitted that I wasn't working at the time. She said, ""Oh! We have an opening where I work! I'll put a good word in for you,"" which was nice considering she barely knew me at the time and I'm not sure *I'd* have vouched for a near-stranger that quickly, cousin or not.   


Carnie told me she was a front-desk worker at a hotel. That wasn't the exact kind of work I was looking for, but maybe it would tide me over until I found something else. It was a small, no-name hotel but it was in a moderate part of town so I decided I'd go check it out to see if it seemed safe and not skeezy. (I don't want to sound too snobby but I wasn't so desperate for work that I'd go work at some sketchy place.) What I found was that it was a hotel on the decline but still had fairly reasonable clientele, a lot of business travelers due to having a good, hot breakfast buffet, so I applied.  


 The manager was also an extra-large, and kind of a negative, cranky, older-woman. But she hired me on the spot and said I could start the following week.  
My job was extremely easy - obnoxiously so. I babysat the front desk from 3 to 11pm five days a week. It wasn't terribly busy, mostly business travelers and occasionally groups in town for sports tournaments or conventions. But mostly, I answered the phone now and then, I checked someone into a room now and then, and I took a reservation now and then. Occasionally someone might ask me to bring extra towels or new batteries for the remote control to their room. Mostly I read a book or watched free cable.  There was even a chair to sit in behind the front desk because neither the manager nor Carnie felt they should have to stand for long periods of time.   
 

I don't know if this is typical of working at small hotels, but the owner didn't want to pay the housekeepers for more hours than he had to, so they left a lot of laundry (towels and bedspreads -- the sheets were professionally laundered) for the desk clerks to do.  I was told by the manager I didn't have to do all of it; that I could leave some of it for the overnight shift; just as long as someone got it done by morning, they didn't care who. Laundry wasn't difficult work and it gave me something to do, so I didn't mind doing it.  


Carnie worked the overnight shift. *She* minded doing the laundry. A LOT. She whined she wasn't strong enough to lift all the laundry in and out of the machines, that it was too difficult to twist and turn while loading and unloading the machines, and that she couldn't handle pushing the big, rolling laundry baskets. If I left her anything, she'd sigh deeply on a good day, and complain loudly on a bad one. She would grumble and dance around the subject, but basically she tried to insinuate that laundry was the *evening-shift* employee's job and that I was only allowed leave some for overnights if I absolutely couldn’t finish it all. You know, she had to prepare breakfast in the mornings, after all! She shouldn't have to do *everything!*   
 

Her complaints seemed silly because it really was NOT that difficult to do laundry – most of it was towels for heaven's sake. I rarely even used those big, rolling laundry baskets. She was just super lazy! Maybe if she'd ever said, ""Well, I have this old injury and I *can't* twist this way"" I might have given her a pass, but I never heard about a particular injury; she was just really out of shape and didn't much like doing the slightest amount of physical activity.   
 

I simply got into the habit of doing all the laundry on the evening shift so as not to have to listen to her whining. She wasn't just a coworker but a relative so I wanted to get along and not argue or be petty. It didn't matter that much to me.  
  

After I'd been working there a few months, Carnie decided she had to have the evening shift to work around the hours she was picking up at a second job. Out of the blue I was told by the manager that I'd be switching to the night shift. I was a bit blindsided by this news. No one asked how I felt about it, or if I'd even be available to work that shift, I was just told. When I questioned why I had to give up my shift, I was told Carnie had ""seniority"" and could choose what shift she wanted. It's a small business, though, so I didn't have many rights or options. I might have just quit then, but I guess I was in a rut and being a bit lazy about job searching, so I went along with it.  


I wasn't all that upset, but the part that really bothered me was that Cousin Carnie never said anything about this to me directly, even though I was seeing her pretty much every day. Why not just talk to me? How hard is it to say, ""You know, I wanted to ask you something I hope you aren't mad, but I took a second job and I kinda wanna work evening shift now to work that out. Would you hate me if I wanted to swap shifts with you?"" But I guess she was afraid I *would* get mad and say no, or yell at her or whatever, so she took the cowardly way out and said nothing to me, instead choosing to whine to the manager to get her shift changed and then making the manager tell me. (I don't know that she *whined* but I sort of always pictured it going that way.)  


Fine, whatever. I could work the night-shift schedule. I was simply a bit miffed at how it was all handled. I wish she'd just talked to me about it like a grown-up. 

  
Now while I'm on overnights, not surprisingly, she started leaving *all* the laundry for me. When I said something to her about it (""Yeah, when I worked evening shift, remember it was supposed to be the evening shift's job to get all the laundry done?"") her excuse was, ""Oh, I thought you LIKED doing it. I'm doing you a *favor* so you don't get bored. It's so boring on night-shift. Tee hee hee!"" Uh-huh.   
 

(I soon found she would always giggle stupidly whenever she was giving me a dumb answer or an obviously fake excuse, like she knew she was guilty but hoped to dismiss everything away with a giggle. It became an obvious tell that she was full of shit and knew it.) 

  
I'm an easy-going person generally, and I tend to put up with more crap than I should because I choose my battles and I'm only going to get a case of the ass if something is really important to me. In a way she was right, graveyard shift at the hotel was even more boring than evening shift, so I honestly *did* need to keep busy, and I let her BS slide. I just did the laundry without complaint and let her get away with being lazy.

  
If you're wondering how I ""got even"" with her, I didn't have to. Karma took care of it for me so my hands remained clean. See, switching shifts came to bite her in the butt because now that more people saw and interacted with her, her shortcomings as a desk clerk were on full display.

I've explained to her that yes while it blows most people on a fixed income have learned how to get by without complaining.

She seems super entitled and implies that while it may happen to everybody else it should not be happening to her. I want to say to her well maybe if you'd learn how to put down the fork and ration better it wouldn't happen to you as much but of course I don't want to be rude and end up with a bad neighbor. I just get tired of listening to her complain because I grew up in a family where we pinched pennies wherever we could and so this was normal for me.

I'm just tired of listening to her complain and want to tell her to STFU.

fatpeoplestories,"So reading this subreddit, I’m reminded so bad of this guy I worked a season with at a theme park. I say a season; he lasted about 4 months before he eventually got sacked. I’ve decided to call him Mr Earache, as he literally sounded like a foghorn when he spoke.

Mr Earache was huge. He couldn’t go on any of the rides that he was working on because he couldn’t fit in them. The uniform department had to make specialised shirts for him and even then his stomach hung out, and it took him forever to walk anywhere. It wouldn’t be an issue if he was willing to actually do any work, but the reality is that Mr Earache always had an excuse not to do something. He was incredibly rude and obnoxious to both guests and other staff, including managers and the people training him, received numerous complaints and counteracted every single one by accusing them of bullying him for his weight. 

On an average day, he’d often rock up to work late. Our breaks are 30 minutes, twice a day, and he’d have at least 40 on each and have a large cafeteria meal each time. One day I witnessed him eating a huge sausage and bacon sandwich whilst he was walking (late) to our morning briefing, and not even an hour later he was devouring fish and chips and an ice cream in the canteen on his first break. He was eating, constantly. 

I wasn’t sure which story to go with, because there were a fair few, but this one might be the most egregious.

It was a warm summers day, so we were all working hard. I was working with Mr Earache that day and I was in charge of the ride we were stationed on, so whilst operating the ride and dealing with a busy queue, I also had to put up with his persistant complaining about the heat, how it was abuse making him stand outside etc. About 2pm I receive a phone call from my manager informing me that myself and Mr Earache had to attend a practice evacuation on another ride we both worked on after close. They usually take 30 minutes at most and are a regular occurrence. 

Mr Earache is furious about this news, goes on about his it’s a disgrace and sulks for the rest of the day. Once we close, I send him to the practice early because I know it’s going to take him a long time to walk over, and also to get rid of him for a bit. He shuffles off, I do my closedown checks and ring the operator on that ride to let him know we’re both on our way.

The operator on this ride is a guy called Mr Fluffhead (curly hair, so laid back he’s horizontal). Fluffhead and I are good friends and have been for quite some time, and he *really* hated Mr Earache. I get to his ride and chill with him for a bit as the others staying arrive. Everyone gets there but Mr Earache is nowhere to be seen. I had sent him off at 6.10 and it was now 6.30. As we give up and decide to start, Mr Earache finally decided to stroll over to us. 

The practice goes off without much of a hitch. Mr Fluffhead asks me to fill in some paperwork for him, and asks Mr Earache and another girl on the team to send the ride around for the engineers to work on in the morning. This glorious conversation occurs:

Mr F: hey Mr E, can you dispatch please?

Mr E: why can’t RaRa do it?

Mr F:because I’ve asked you to do it.

Mr E: are you trying to kill me off? I’ve worked all day! 

Mr F: yes, so have we!

Mr E: you shouldn’t be making me do all this work with the way I am! You know I can’t manage very well! 

Mr Earache skulks over and sends the ride round, then immediately storms off like a teenager (this guy was like 30 btw). This highly irritates Fluffhead.

Mr F: did I say you could go?

Mr E: what so I have to ask permission now? GO FUCK YOURSELF!

Fluffhead and I head back to the office and inform our manager, who rolls her eyes and then asks us to write statements. Lo and behold, the next morning, Mr Earache goes in to tell her that we were bullying him last night. For asking him to do his job....She pulls out the statements and goes “well I’ve got their version of events so I’m interested to hear.”

He lasted maybe 3 weeks after that event. 

There are more stories about him. I’m not sure where he is now, but last time I checked his Facebook he was working for a “Secret Company”, whatever that is...",When an obnoxious ham gets a job at a theme park
fatpeoplestories,"Thanks for all the support on part 1 i'm glad you all enjoyed it. Now back to the show.

British university housing is pretty standard nationwide, in the share kitchen we each have a cupboard or two clearly marked with our room numbers and each get an individual shelf in a refrigerator and a freezer. There's always an urban legend about a flatmate who always steals milk anywhere you go, this story proves truth is stranger than fiction.

Characters:

* Me/kimjoe: average height, hunky gym rat, 70kg of muscle and peanut butter, super clean eater (apart from alcohol and drunk food)
* Mary: Female flatmate, sweet christian girl, too nice for this world, amazing baker.
* Chinny: 2nd Female flatmate, tiny, not as nice, awful baker, loves a good argument.
* Hammy: Titular Character, looks like hes given up on life, 130kg of pasty sweaty blubber, always hungry.

Hammy's foray into burglary can be split into 2 separate events, the first happening before the toilet troubles around october/november time. So here goes Nothing.

Case Number 1

Myself Mary and Chinny had decided to attend a bar crawl hosted by the cheer team and the dance squad, myself included as a plus one to mary and Chinny. Fun was had we drunk enough jagerbombs to cause heart palpitations, chatted and danced with pretty girls, possibly got with one of said girls, good times. All nights have to come to an end though, but i decided to end it on a high note buying a fresh hot pizza from the cheapest sketchiest place possible on our way home. Upun our return we notice Hammy's bedroom light is still on and faintly hear what i recognise as dark souls if i had to guess, nothing out of the ordinary at this point. We demolish this pizza between us partly because we fucked up cutting it with our sloppy drunk skills and because drunk people and hot cheesy Carbs. This left all those congealed bits of cheese and sauce and toppings all over the bottom of the box. 

I'm sure some of you can tell where this is going. 

We all head to bed, I get into my comfiest pyjamas but notice i forgot to fill my water bottle in preparations for tomorrows hangover, so naturally i go to fill up in the kitchen. I flick the light switch and low and behold what do i see, Hammy hunched over the box, shirtless in threadbare lounge shorts that have seen better days. Pudgy fingers scraping up the cardboard, grease smeared all over his hands up to his wrists. His back is facing away from me he jolts when the light hits him, he jiggles sending ripples from his neck down to his overly developed hips, his long dark sparse clumps of back hair bristle as he prepares his flight or fight response. I'm too shocked/drunk/tired/about to shit myself laughing to deal with this so i fill up and head to bed, just after i report this in our flat group chat (that he removed himself from in the first week) as a warning to anyone else heading for a midnight snack in the future. Obviously drunk me wasn't very believable so i had to reexplain the story to my flatmates, initially no one believed me they thought i must be crazy but over time they all had similar experiences with the night beast.

Case Number 2

Until this point other than having to bleach my eyes no one was hurt by hammy's behaviour but just like a tumour it got worse. Mary was heavily involved in Church and in a christian society and what else can a devout christian baker do better to serve God than to bake in the name of the lord, and boy did she bake; brownies, cup cakes, flapjacks, banana bread and anything else she could find a recipe for. It was glorious while it lasted, first the box or tray she left for us would empty a little too fast, then the box she took to church was a little light, either the cake fairy was taking a sugar tax or someone was stealing from the lord. Seeing as the sugar fairy isn't real it had to be option 2 and who else could it be other than our resident ham? This wasn't the end of it though the rush from the crime must have got to him, small things started disappearing, my flat had 5 girls so it was always stocked with emergency chocolate for that time of the month but somehow these emergency medical supplies started disappearing from our fridge. Was Hammy ovulating? I hope not. Still we had no proof not everyone can keep a perfect mental inventory of their diabeetus stash so we had to go old school. Written lists and even photos of our shelves to mark if anything was moved and it did. It was like we were haunted by a hungry little poltergeist. Snacks disappeared, tea bags pilfered, Biscuits gone. I thought i was safe i ate clean and cooked everything from scratch and no one wants to steal brown rice or wholewheat pasta do they? 

I was young and naive. We all left for Christmas and came back one by one, i was the second person to arrive and who was there to greet me other than our resident ham. It looked like he never left maybe he didn't, free WiFi and electricity, no chores, 24 hours a day to eat and play games and no parents telling him to shower must have been heaven for him. The day passes and everyone comes back and the flat is back on a food lock down. It was pretty clear our cupboards had been raided again and again and again and again, crumbs scattered all over the floor the only sign of the devastation left behind. 

All this stress gave me a craving and what better than peanut butter to fill that empty void in me, its for sure better than crack or meth so its basically healthy right? I pull out my jar but wait its lighter than i remember, it cant be, maybe i just got some crazy strength gains from all that Christmas turkey, no one would touch my secret peanut butter would they? I grab a couple bananas and get ready to dig in, i pop the lid and what do i see? I see grooves that look like its been dug out bare handed, i gag a little, why do bad things happen to good people? Fury. I stomp down to his room and pound on his door until he opens up and march him to the kitchen, the whole flat comes out to get a front row seat to this drama. I ask kindly.

 ""Who ate my Fucking Peanut Butter!?""

He tries to pass the blame off onto chinny blubbering about how she eats it as well, his argument falling apart before it gets out of his mouth. (one of the few things that doesnt go into his mouth)

""Chinny's 4 fucking foot 10, She cant reach the top fucking shelf you dumb fat cunt, i can see your fat finger prints in my jar""

Cue more blabbering excuses  some of our neighbours have come around to see what the hell is going on, possibly to see a fight break out. I'm waving the jar in his face and a screaming match starts up, leading to us squaring up my eyes in line with his mouth. I never noticed how bad his teeth were before i'm no dentist and i don't know what a cavity looks like but i think i can see some cavities. He tries to shove me but his move was not very effective, i push back and he sprawls into our table and chairs, it was super effective hammy is weak against anything physical. He spends an almost comical amount of time getting up before he goes for take 2 but not before our neighbours step in and break it up. 

 All this tussling led to meetings with our court wardens, a formal warning and weekly visits from our student life mentor for the rest of the year. Luckily Hammy left after our January exams, whether he dropped out or moved away i don't know i don't care i never saw him again gladly.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short Hammy no longer content with scraping up and eating our leftovers begins his career in crime before he takes it one step too far and touches my pb.

I probably have enough material for another Hammy story mostly about his attitude towards women, socializing and drinking, my ""night"" guests and the fact that i was ""mogging"" him think thats the word for it nowadays. it might help explain why everyone was so eager to see a fight break out. Let me know if you want more.

So, maybe I'm a scrooge- because- hey, I love food too. But I am the youngest person in my office, and I don't have the most money, and feel obligated to bring stuff is a lot too. If I don't- then I get asked about it and also it's a competition seemingly and if I bring something not homemade it's looked upon as cheap. Most of my coworkers are tupperware moms who know how to cook like crazy and make food for life. Just sharing my observations, as this seems a little overkill- as well as ironic that our largest person in department who takes up entire hallway seems SO concerned about potluck. Maybe if she was less concerned she'd....

Also- this is extremely inefficient and no one else can see what has overlapped- since no one ""replies-all."" Has she ever heard of Google docs?",Office ham initiates endless potlucks
fatpeoplestories,"So, today, I was at my favorite bakery. I was in the neighborhood and decided to stop in for a piece of my favorite baklava in the world. Seriously, like, it's magical. I paid, and as I was just about to take a bite, I noticed two things. Firstly, it was the last piece. Secondly, there was a small child behind me who was tearing up. It's not like I needed that baklava. I just wanted it, and this kid was about to have a really rough time if he didn't get it. I have a soft spot for kids so I gave it to him. His mom wanted to pay me back for it and I insisted that it's no problem and that it's a blessing for me to be able to make a kid's day. So this kid was looking at this baklava some kind of way. He looked at it the way a newlywed man is supposed to look at his beloved on their wedding night. The honey was glistening. The flakes were crumbly. It was perfect and this kid, being no more than three or four years old, but he still had the presence of mind to savor the moment. He didn't just bite into it. That was his mistake. 
Enter our villain. Let's call her Landwhalia. She looked like a diabetic beachball. She was, as Patton Oswalt described, ""B-word fat"" where you could tell how fat a person is just by listening to them say words that begin with the letter B. 
""Can I have a piece of baklava?""
""Sorry, ma'am. The child got the last piece.""
I shit you the fuck not. She turns around and snatches it from this kid's hand and eats it. The kid started to cry and she left. The mom looked at me, and I knew what's up. I said ""Don't worry. I'll watch him."" She stormed out and I didn't see what happened, but I definitely heard it. A slap that registered on a seismograph. I heard the police stop in the parking lot, obviously concerned about an attractive armenian woman attacking an overinflated beach ball. I just heard one cop yell ""That's fucking low"" and there was peace as the mother came back in and Landwhalia trudged on in search for a large body of saltwater. The child calmed down. The owner gave the kid a little piece of Napoleon cake on the house. The kid's name? Steve Jobs. Just kidding. But seriously. Shit got wild. ",Sticky Fingers
fatpeoplestories,"It's my first post so be nice.

A few years ago in my first year of university i had the pleasure of living with a hammy man/child. For stories sake we were in university accommodation in a flat of 7 people 5 girls 2 boys, each person had a bedroom and an en suite bathroom. 

Me: KimJoe your storyteller, 5ft 10 about 75kg, committed gym lad, clean pooper and neat freak.

Hammy: neighbour, 6ft 3 if he stopped hunching over, at a guess anywhere between 120 to 130 kg, lazy, violent pooper. Awful Person to live with. Food Thief. Possible lover of tight spaces.

So after moving in to my new home, making friends, puking on a club dance floor, living off a diet of cheesy chips and beer and all kinds of dumb stuff during our freshers week it was time to settle down a bit and live like a human. Not everyone got that memo specifically Hammy. Its fair to say most people are not used to living away from home at first, some people don't realize how much work laundry and ironing is or how to cook human sized portions. This doesn't apply to our resident ham as he did neither, sustaining himself on a nutritious diet of microwave meals and takeaway food and looking and smelling like he rolled out of pig sty in joggers (sweatpants) and black band or movie t shirts. For the first few months he was bearable as he didn't talk to me too much and stayed in his room most of the time. 

Until one of the worst days of my life.

I received a message from him on a Thursday night saying "" hey KJ my toilets broken and it cant be repaired until Monday would i be able to use yours?"" being the soft sap pushover that i am i couldn't say no, plus i'm the only other guy in the flat, I've never seen him speak to any of the girls so he must feel more comfortable as i'm a guy. Right?. The biggest regret of my life.

Within 30 seconds of my reply my door is flung open, no knocks or anything i rush to close whatever was on my laptop out of pure habit before a waft of hot air and vinegar hits me, he rushes into my toilet/shower room and slams the door shut. The following noises still haunt me to this day, if anyone has ever seen or heard watery and chunky pig slop being poured imagine that with added bonus of sounds of what i can only imagine was violent sharts decorating the toilet bowl. Eventually it comes to an end whether its been 30 seconds or 30 minutes i have no idea, either way i don't want to know. Cue the sounds of rustling for a few more minutes, before the door opens no running water or any sign of his hands being washed at all.

The door swings open again slamming up against the wall, the ham scurries out back to his lair without even the basic thanks. Then the smell comes. My eyes water as i rush to open my window, i spray deodorant and cologne but nothing works, i prepare to embrace death. It was like a mix rotting food, stale apple ciders and barbecue sauce. I had to leave for over a half hour for the fragrance to leave. I eventually got around to inspecting the damage done to my poor toilet bowl and boy was i in for a surprise. Watery brown splatters decorated underneath the seat and along the rim of the bowl, the thickest skid marks i have ever seen (as thick as my fingers) smeared down the back of the bowl past the water line, i nearly vomited saved by the fact that my face would have to get closer to the mess in order to spew. I checked the toilet paper and noticed an almost new roll was now just a barren card tube. I felt like i had truly entered my own hell.

This was only the beginning. It turns out ham was either very regular or that a diet of microwave curry will clean you out faster than any fit tea cleanse plan they try sell you on insta. Any amount between 4 to 7 visits a day just for number 2's (i counted) over the weekend each one as bad as the last. Until finally my toilet gave up, the bolts holding the seat in place couldn't take it anymore and were sheered clean off. This little miracle meant that the ham couldn't sit on my toilet anymore without it sliding to the side, making it much too dangerous for him to wipe. He eventually stopped coming and his toilet was fixed at some point by some poor underpaid maintenance worker.

Finally i was saved, i felt hope for the first time in a while, the sun came out and everything smelt better. That was until i got another message. ""My showers blocked i need to use yours"" 

I should have learnt my lesson, but no i'm a fool. I give him approval and he bursts in again heading straight for my shower. No towel, no soap, no shampoo, no loofah. My heart drops but hey at least he will be a bit cleaner when he comes out. I set the bar so low and he still couldn't reach it. The showers in uni accommodation are never spacious even for me being much smaller than the ham, so i don't want to imagine what he felt like in there. Surprisingly he must have felt pretty good because i began to hear a rapid slapping sound and faint bumping against the side of the shower cubicle. Yup. God has abandoned me. I want to die. I look for a pencil to stab my eardrums out with. No luck. Thankfully he finishes up in just a few (maybe 3 or less felt like 300) minutes. Shower turns off, more rustling and he walks out as if he hasn't tainted my personal space. I ask him ""you have  nice shower there mate?"" 

My sarcasm goes completely over his head, he replies without missing a beat. ""the showers a bit small""

I brace myself again to inspect the damage, my loofah, soap and shampoo are all on the floor and what i hope is shampoo is circling around the drain. I can hazard a guess why his showers blocked. I put my marigolds on and bin everything swearing to myself that he will never touch anything i own ever again. 

This was my first ever post and i have more stories abut this guy, if anyone wants them let me know.

Me: beautyhack 27F trying to drop 10 more kg to reach my weight goal and exercising regularly.

Ham: random ham that just popped up from another dimension.

I didn’t have the opportunity to have breakfast today so I went to a kfc and order 12 wings for lunch 😁. I was really enjoying them and I  was alone since I left late for lunch and everyone at the office already went, then ham arrived and stopped at my table just staring at me so I looked up and she told me that why nobody was giving me the nasty look she gets every time she he is eating there, that I’m having a lot of wings and nobody is judging me for that and that it is fat fobia. I just looked at her and went back to my wings. She said bitch I’m talking to you and I just told here  “ you wanna now how it feels when people just ignore you while you eat? I just did it, I ignored you so what else you want? Now please fuck off and let me finish my food”
She went mumbling something and order a fucking bucket, two large fries and a gigantic coke.., ohhh and chocolate cake you know because she got depressed.... I just don’t understand why. ",Jealous ham planet
fatpeoplestories,"Hi, FPS! It's been a reaaaaaally long time since I've posted anything, this has mostly been due to me trying to be a less confrontational person and much more patient (thanks to my fiancée) but today I just snapped.

So, first and foremost I will introduce myself again because I'm sure you don't remember me and use this opportunity to introduce a few more people.

**MrNumeros (Me)- Male, 1.84m (6ft), 83kg (182lbs), gym-rat, boxer and former personal trainer.**

**Pig (Not a mean nickname, it's his actual nickname)- Male, 53 years old, 1.70m (5'7""), 93kg (205lbs), nice guy, has been working out with me for the last 7 months and I've gotten him from 115kg (254lbs) to where he is now trough hard work and dedication.**

**Professor (self explanatory) 43 years old, 1.78m (5'10""), 74kg (163lbs), he also works out with me and he's pretty fit, just likes the buddy system I guess.**

**Cunt - 24 years old(?), about 1.55m (5'1""), 80kg (177lbs), she is an annoying gym member, never actually seen her workout. Is a cunt.**


So, I've stated that I used to be a personal trainer and yet also mention two gentlemen that work out with me. While it's true that I no longer train people for profit I still take people under my wing for free to see if I can introduce them to my hobby (weightlifting). All I ask for in return is commitment and the will to keep trying, I don't talk down to people I work out with, nor do I make them feel that they're worth any less than anyone else. It's not how I was raised and the way I see it is that if they're hitting the weights with me it means that they want to achieve something and better themselves.


These two particular gentlemen are people I met at the gym, our friendship started simply enough, both would ask me questions or ask me to spot them and I would help them out. This eventually turned into them asking (separately) to work out with me, I gave them my regular schedule and that was that. 


Fast forward 'til today and we have the story that this whole post is about. Me and the boys were working our biceps and we needed to do some preacher curls, this gym is pretty small so we only have one station, this is usually not a problem but today was not a usual day. We make our way to the preacher curl station and notice that Cunt is sitting on it and using her phone. I kindly ask her if she was done using the equipment or if she needed more time. She looked straight into my eyes as to acknowledge my existence but gave me no answer and went back to her phone. Now, I know this bitch isn't deaf, she is always texting or talking on the phone, but I try again. She sighs and tells me that she is using that particular station, this is weird to me seeng as how there is no bar or dumbbells anywhere nearby. I let it slide and tell the guys to do some hammer curls with me.


We get dine with hammer curls and I look over to the preacher curl station and Cunt is still just sitting there on her fucking phone. I go over and ask if she was STILL using the fucking station, she answers me in a bitchy tone that yes, for my information she was still indeed using the station. She smirks at something on her phone and continues to sit there. I'm absolutely boiling inside but I promised my fiancée that I would be a more understanding person so I send the guys for a quick water break. Knowing full well that I can't let these guys get cold or have them wear themselves down doing unnecessary exercises I give it another try, just me and her.


She responds in the same manner as before but not before she squeezes in the comment that just killed me, she said p and I quote; ""You know there are easier ways to hit on me, you don't have to be annoying to get my number"". Seriously? What the fuck? I just lost it and told her something along the lines of; ""I'm not trying to get talk to you, I'm trying to work out! But you're always on your fucking phone and just sitting around! There are people trying to use the equipment!""


She gave me this look of horror as if I had just punched the pope and shit in the toy aisle of wal-mart, a disgusted look. She basically rebutted by telling me that harassing her for her lack of stamina and her routine is basically racism (fat is not a race). I just stare and she just gets up and leaves. We do our preacher curls.

The end.

I asked my sister ""is he really doing that"" and I guess he heard me, he got up, went to the register and asked for a box so he can get the food he stole to go. He didn't look homeless or poor either. Hammies really have no self control/shame whatsoever.

I did have this encounter earlier in the month that I live-texted to my friend who reminded me about it today.

&amp;#x200B;

I was near a woman sat where a set of two seats face each other. Her stomach was protruding so far, no one could sit on the seats opposite her. She was talking to her friend who was sitting next to me, asking him why he isn't fat (average sized dude). They started talking about having cupcakes at the place they were just at, and the guy said he only ate 2. The woman screeches loudly (maybe I would've heard her even with my headphones?) ""OH MY GOD, HOW ARE YOU SO THIN,  
I ATE WAY LESS THAN YOU"" (So one cupcake?)

&amp;#x200B;

Her friend called her out by reminding her ""Last time your mum made cupcakes you ate all 3 dozen of them in one night"".

&amp;#x200B;

She argued it wasn't three dozen, because there were still 4 left.

&amp;#x200B;

I quietly double checked the maths on this, because I didn't believe my own mind-calculation for a second. There were 36 cupcakes. She ate 32 in one sitting.","""I didn't eat three dozen cupcakes... because there was 4 left!"" or Fat Logic in the Wild"
fatpeoplestories,"I've been thinking about this for a while- there's a statistic (I'm sure all of you know it) that says obese people are more likely to survive a heart attack. But that's the only thing I've heard about it. My thought is, that the reason this is true is because obese people tend to get heart attacks younger, whereas normal people get them much much older when their hearts are already worn down. Since a lot of obese people have heart attacks at a young age, doesn't the fact that they're much younger pay a factor in survivability? Younger people are more likely to survive a heart attack, so I thought that would be a huge factor. Hope this makes sense! ",A thought on a statistic
fatpeoplestories,"The day I moved in with Virginia and her teenage daughter was not a happy one.   I had recently broken up with my ex, and while it had been a mutual break up, one where we both realized that it was not in either of our best interest to remain together, it still hurt a lot.

Virginia had listed her room on craigslist saying that having another female in the house would be good for her daughter who she listed as mildly learning disabled.  She said when we spoke later on that she did not expect for anyone to be providing babysitting services for the 13-year-old, they just wanted someone whom she could hang out with since her mother was working so much.  I thought this seemed like a good plan in the beginning, so I agreed to the terms of the lease and moved in.

Anyway, my first day there, as I was unpacking the groceries that I had into the cabinet that had been cleared out for my use, Virginia remarked about how much healthy and also what she considered strange food that I ate.  Now both Virginia and her daughter were obese, and clearly from peeking into some of their cabinets, ate a ton of processed food, but I wasn't looking to place any judgment.  I had recently started on the keto diet and started to explain that to Virginia, and about the health benefits I had already noted and that I was losing a lot of weight already.  

Virginia responded to this by laughing a little and saying that of course starving your body would make you lose weight but that nobody can abstain from sugar forever, that eventually, I would find myself just as fat as her and her daughter, in fact, she said I should learn to be proud of my childbearing style body and stop putting myself through so much shame about being bigger.

I smiled, thanked her for her concern and went about my life.  

Fast forward a few days into living with them and Virgnia's daughter had come home from school just as I was fixing myself a snack, she watched me take out a cinnamon sugar muffin that I had baked with almond flour, among other things, and she asked what my food tasted like.  Well, I had asked her mom before if it was alright for her daughter to eat anything I made since I often found I made a lot of extra sweets I could not consume on my own, and she had agreed it was fine.  

Well her daughter loved this muffin!  She said it was actually not too sweet and she wished her mom made more things like that instead.  I asked her if she would like to cook with me one day and she said she would love to, so we made friendly plans to do this.

A few days after this, Virginia sent me a text while I was out asking if we could talk later that night, she specifically said, after her daughter had gone to bed.  Well, we ended up having this talk in the garage!  She was stuffing her face with something, which was normal for her as if she could not stand to be that far away from food ever.  And she tore into me while crumbs from the packet of snack cakes flew from her mouth.

""I would appreciate it if you could have some respect to try to not turn my daughter against me, now she is telling me that you and her are going to cook together and bak some of this healthy crap you try to promote and I just think you need to have some respect for people who can't eat the way you do!!""

I apolizied, she snorted a bit in acceptance and went to get more snacks from the fridge in the kitchen, leaving me to stand in the garage and wonder if I had really messed up or not?

Well, life after that was strained there.  I stopped interacting with them as much, I didn't flat out ignore them, but I did notice that she started to move my things in the fridge farhter and farther back, a few times I am sure she threw stuff out so there was more room for her own crappy food, but I could not prove it.

Well guys, I did it, I lost 50 pounds since June!!!  And I hit under 200 pounds about a week ago.  And a few friends of mine were throwing me a party, we were going to go out walking and we had planned a small picnic of all keto friendly snacks, it was going to be an awesome fun time.  

Before we all got ready to leave the house, there were about 4 of us there, and anyway Virgnia asked what all the happy excitement was about and I hesitated to tell her, knowing how upset she had gotten before.  Well one of my friends blurted the news out for me.  Vorginia nodded, said something that could have either been congratulations, or possibly, fuck you and we left soon after.

The next day I was greeted with a barage of tests.

Virgnia was accusing me of having an eating disorder, losing 50 pounds in so short a time was unhealthy for me, I must have an eating disorder and now I was trying to pass one on to her daughter.  I needed to move out immediately because I was fat-shaming her by daring to lose so much weight in such a short time frame.

Also she did not realize I was a lesbian, but it was something one of my friends had indirectly referred to during our conversation, and she did not approve of that either!  Evil I am!

And this is the story of why I'm now currently looking for a new place I can afford to live in :)


EDIT:  please do NOT go tell me about how I deserve 30 days before being evicted and on and on, I don't WANT to live here for whatever time she should HAVE to give me, she can go shove all that up her asshole with everything else she has festering up there!

If someone wants to take this over, fine by me, I'll write you up a nice little guide in how to most efficiently do so; I have this down to a science, as you might imagine. It isn't difficult by any stretch of the imagination, just tedious once you get the hang of it after like five minutes. 

If not...I'm serving notice. I'll finish out the year, but after that, fuck it. I have a lot more shit to do these days than I used to, and the series list dropped to about #157 on my ""things I need to get done"" list. 

Also, I'm not getting paid for this and did I mention, I am really goddamn tired of it? 

Gods know those lists now represent roughly six months' worth of reading if you never did anything but read the stories there. No sleep, no food, no bathroom breaks. So. I think y'all will survive if I drop this. 

Again, if someone wants to take this over, groovy. I'll set you up with the wiki permissions and whatnot, teach you how, and be on my merry.

The cast is small for this short but beetusy tale. 
Be: me, AztecLawyer. Short, bitter alcoholic law student. Nearly in shape, still working on it (whiskey calories). Actually maybe don't be me...

But dont be: Greyhound-Ham, a rotund man of notable circumference. Looks to be aging.

I work at a haunted house a few hours from where I go to school. Call time is at five, and it is currently four. The bus is more than an hour behind.

Now, sometimes Greyhound is late because its Greyhound and they suck. So when my bus was delayed thirty minutes, I figured that was the issue. Fine, I could still make it. Besides my best friend and I hadn't eaten yet and I had an active character tonight so we figured we'd grab a bite and wait. No biggie.

The bus later arrived, and out wiggles the driver, a man of notable size. Usually I pay this no mind, everyone destroys their body somehow. I'm just as bad. So I just sit down and start working on case briefs. But I do note that it took longer than usual for the bus to resume its trip.

However, at the first stop, it becomes apparent what was causingthe delays. After loading all the new passengers, Greyhound-Ham proceeded to waddle over to the station. We then waited for around fifteen minutes, in a stationary bus, waiting for the man to return. 
He returns with a large sandwhich, some chips, and a soda, which was apparently was what so important that he had to delay the bus mote. And upon sitting down upon his chair, Greyhound-Ham decided to take a minute to open his chips, unwrap his sandwhich, and take a few nice bites before continuing driving.

Second stop, he does the same exact thing. Except this time it takes even longer, for whatever reason, and he returned three bags of chips, instead of a sandwhich, and another soda. Once again, he had to get a few chips down his gullet to continue driving.

Now I'm still on the bus, and were hitting traffic. There is one more stop. I fear for what beetusy foods he decides he absolutely must consume then.

fatpeoplestories,"Short and sweet. I ride Amtrak on a daily basis - the seats are fairly wide and are two by two on either side of an aisle. About half the time no one is sitting next to me. This was not the case yesterday.  

I was sitting in the aisle seat because the person in front of me in the window seat had his seat reclined back. No one was beside me. At the next stop, people got on - among them was a large ham who had to walk with the aid of a four pronged cane due to his size. He went down the aisle past me and then waddled back. I prayed for invisibility, but sure enough, his shadow loomed over me. ""Is this seat taken?"" I told him he could sit in the window seat since I was getting off at the next stop (and had no faith that he'd be able to get up and move out of my way in time for me to get off before the train left), and got up to let him in.

There followed several minutes of the ham slowly wedging his way into the seat with lots of groans and exhalations. By the time the fat had settled, there was about 12 inches of usable seat for me to sit in. I'm petite, but my ass is larger than 12 inches wide, so rather than cramming myself up against the ham I waved the white flag and went to sit with someone else.

fatpeoplestories,"Hello! Thought it might be nice to kick off the weekend with some treats. Thank you those who have read the previous ‘Landlord’ entries for your support; all whilst being able to join me drawing out humour from my abysmal stint in the Beetus Cell (Please see Part 1 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/9omf9d/corrupt\_landlord\_that\_lived\_in\_the\_kitchen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/9omf9d/corrupt_landlord_that_lived_in_the_kitchen/) and 2 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/9ozz0g/corrupt\_landlord\_part\_2\_assaulted\_by\_carbs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/9ozz0g/corrupt_landlord_part_2_assaulted_by_carbs/)).

People go through FAR worse things all of the time, but life is strange and it can be surprising what gets you shook, when down on paper it isn’t the ‘worst’ thing (even I) have experienced. So even the comments agreeing that he was a pig gives me a degree of comfort.

SO, following the ‘here comes the airplane’ assault, I met my housemate, Banished Guy (the only housemate I saw since he hid away the least given the fact he wasn’t creeped on by SG) for some house-share bonding.

**PART 3**

On Friday night, I bought Banished Guy a pint and didn’t even try to pace the inquisition.

Me: ‘How do you like SG?’

Banished Guy wore the fixed grin he’d maintained throughout the week whenever I attempted to break what I suspected was salesman façade.

BG: ‘I don’t want to taint your view’

Me: ‘There’s something off’. A phrase wide open to interpretation. The ale beheaded, he confirmed that the weekend ‘his’ batch of housemates arrived, they’d all congregated at the end of the week and voiced their discomfort. To which Banished Guy embarked on extensive research into the SG Sham.

What he found, was that SG had been banned as being Director for any company, for the rest of his life following fraudulent activity. As a result, he’d let out his spare rooms to stay afloat. This also explained his wife’s bitter devotion to the Tesco Rota.

The bleached hair I was still pulling from my headboard belonged to a twenteen who was currently dragging SG through court over various tenancy rights and harassment.

BG: ‘She couldn’t take the rules, asked to leave, so he gave her 24 hours, or she’d be bound to the contract. She couldn’t act that quickly, and she hadn’t realised she’d agreed to the deal to begin with because of how he’d worded the contract. I didn’t either. Have you signed it already?’

Only a few nights prior, during a Secret Eaters episode (research), an envelope slid under the bedroom door. I paused a beat, before stooping to retrieve the steamy rectangle. Now, had the letter not have been folded, it would have been entirely possible to read the contents without breaking the seal, since the exertion upstairs had produced enough palmsperation to remove the white pigment from the envelope, thus reducing it to a transparent membrane.

I read the smudges at arm’s length. Ah. The Rental Agreement. In there, was a clever clause stating that at the Landlord’s discretion, should the contract be broken before a year’s sentence, I’d be subject to paying rent if and until a new tenant had taken my place (please see the bottom of the page for other ludicrous ‘rules’). Admittedly, I was too busy lol’ing over the clauses concerning The Boys, to have paid attention to the ‘boring’-cum-‘life-wrecking’ stuff, to have reconsidered signing the dotted line. Wheyyy. There aren’t excuses, except that I was a little shook by living under someone’s roof without any formal agreement - leaving them totally within their rights to throw me out in a heartbeat.

BG: ‘Has he claimed to have chosen you because he only houses people he’d employ himself?’

SG handpicking ‘young professionals’ with the intention of ‘housing his own workforce’ was, of course, nothing but an illusionary carrot to a schizophrenic donkey. He’d prayed on female graduates who were between leaving uni and getting their first jobs (unable to afford their own place), spinning a tall tale of how he enjoyed embellishing his house with youngsters, as he and his wife hadn’t had children themselves. That they didn’t **need** the money. In fact, he couldn’t even afford to service his spewing Mercs or replace the Apple Macintosh that was probably older than most of his tenants.

I strongly suspect his expenditure on food contributed to the need for inhabitants.

ME: ‘Have you heard the microwave going off all night?’

BG: ‘Haha that doesn’t surprise me since he sleeps in the pantry’

Realising I’d need convincing, he continued.

BG: ‘I used to eat in the kitchen before SG banned me, and he’d sit on his bed and talk to me with the door open’

I did eventually see the den for myself, when he was doubled over retrieving something of the beige and greasy variety from the floor. A mound of back and/or arse had escaped through the pantry door, to allow the room to accommodate such a spread. I had been attempting to avert my eyes from the ajar door – but morbid curiosity got the better of me.

Also, once employed, I’d be in the kitchen early enough collecting my lunch from the fridge, to hear him in the throes of sleep apnea beside the oven.

In some ways, compared to Banished Guy, my sentence was a picnic, if you will. I was not the male Cinderella shoved in the attic. SG would mock and hiss at him given any opportunity.

BG revealed: ‘I arrived with my colleague originally. So there were 3 guys, including Nephew. I think SG wanted to test the water before he went and chose girls to bring in. It’s kind of obvious Mrs SG didn’t agree to any of us being there. In the year I’ve been there, she’s never acknowledged me.’

Me: ‘But where’s your colleague?’

BG: ‘He was more vocal than I was, so SG kicked him out. Work had to fund temporary accommodation for him, for a bit.’

There was also an unfortunate but strong correlation between SG’s outbursts towards BG since my imprisonment. I’d seen SG attempting to undermine him in front of me, should we be in the kitchen at the same time.

So, we decided that to make life as bearable as possible, we’d have to keep our friendship quiet.

As a result, like rebellious kids, we’d message once SG’s gut-curdling snores upset China’s Richter scale, and I’d sneak upstairs into Banished Guy’s attic to watch movies.

However, whenever I’d return to my cell, no matter how softly I’d padded down the stairs, the ocean’s tides would swirl, and the microwave would begin its graveyard shift. The beast perturbed after an hour’s stew on the pantry mattress.

Although SG remained in a permanent state of dormancy, the sheer effort of the most basic bodily functions must have equaled Banished Guy’s exertion on 12-hour triathlon. The monster’s lungs having to chest press a yard of gelatinous matter with every breath. His heart leaping an eternal looping rope at breakneck speed. His digestive system endlessly bucking and bolting. Hit after hit of oil and sugar until the birds cried and our alarms wailed.

Unfortunately, the snoring was not the only thing causing Eardrum PTSD. Now, I know a lot of people found the last entry grotesque, so this is your warning: **Do not** read the italics if you’re eating/don’t want your weekend ruined:

One day, I returned from the gym and walked into the hallway *to the sound of what I can only describe as an upturned bucket, depositing 3 liters of sausage and baked beans into the toilet. The door wide open, the putrid fog of spiced, bubbling corpses peeling the life-sized celebrity portraiture from the walls. I hurriedly bombed upstairs, before realising I was toeing a backpack full of damp gym kit rotting in the summer heat. I couldn’t make the kitchen secretly, as hoped. Instead I waited for at least 40 minutes in my cell before accepting defeat and entering the Beetus Dungeon*. I began loading the washing machine – all under the hungry eyes of SG - who reclined on a stool by the worktop, panting. He perched at an obtuse angle, legs splayed wide, looking as though he was attempting to suffocate his tailbone.

SG: ‘Been to the gym?’

I nodded.

SG: ‘I used to attend Banished Boy’s one. I was ripped. Nephew and I were never out of the gym. We’d spend at least two or three hours a day there – until I got this hernia’ He said, dipping his eye towards a pronounced bulge afoot mount pancreas.

I murmured an indistinguishable response that could have been anything from ‘Bullshit’ to ‘Brilliant’.

SG: ‘I know, I know, it’s an excuse. I could still try’

I encouraged this notion with a little too much enthusiasm.

Shorty after the assignation of my eardrums via the guest bathroom, I was granted a sales agent position, and so was duly excused from my coffee-shop-chair-rotation. Instead, SG attempted to track my washing machine cycle in order to secure evening kitchen exchanges:

He’d message me to inform me the spin cycle was over. He’d message to say the dry spin had begun. That the dry spin was almost done. That the dry spin was done. One day, when I didn’t immediately gallop down the stairs on the back of a ‘spin cycle update’, I found him picking my underwear from the machine and into the damp swaddle in his arms. The total invasion of privacy began to profoundly affect my health. I’d been to the doctor numerous times about the physical symptoms I was experiencing, which were found to derive from my general persistent distress. Turns out, permanently being in fight or flight mode isn’t healthy. By the time polyps (cyst clusters) had been found within my abdomen, I decided I couldn’t take it anymore – I needed a break. I booked a last minute flight to my hometown, my ex asked me to come home (we’d resumed talking and had remained best friends), and gave my months’ notice to SG. So furious was he, that he spat ‘This isn’t what I signed up for.’ Before storming into his pantry. You’re telling me, mate.

Once I’d returned on Sunday evening (temporarily buoyed after a weekend’s support by old friends), with the biggest clash of terror filtered with relief, I informed SG that my ex and I were giving things a second (or three hundred and fifty seventh) chance. He barked a callous laugh. ‘What makes you think things will be different this time? Silly girl’ he snarled.

The following day, role playing a life insurance claim with a colleague in the office ‘training room’, I received a message from SG saying I had 24 hours to vacate the property, or he’d charge me for the remaining 6 months of my contract whether I remained prisoner or not. He also made it clear that my situation could not be made apparent to either his wife or nephew – who’d ‘be upset’ at my departure. His wife, who hadn’t looked at me once during my entire sentence.

I called my father\* and we planned a midnight escape. I’d act as though there was no other option but for me to stay put – and then scarper. I spent the evening packing as silently as possible and locked my bedroom door (a redundant effort) when I left for work in the morning.

My heart hammered the entire day, building to a crescendo when I slipped into the kitchen for the final time that evening. SG had the good grace to wear a smug smile. ‘Hello Darling’ he cooed. Picture Dudley’s father saying there was no post on Sundays, and you’re 70% of the way there. Clearly, under the intended illusion I was here for the long haul. I gave a defeated smiley sigh and took my Waitrose picnic upstairs. The countdown had begun. I had 5 hours left in the Chubby Chamber, and I couldn’t stop shaking.

Tenancy Agreement continued:

* All doors in the house should be locked ***at all times***, to protect The Boys who were housecats (yes, it really did say ‘The Boys’). An utterly redundant clause, since the poor sods would never have made it through the slats in the fence, nor over the fence itself.
* Bedroom windows were to be kept closed ***at all times*** to avoid rain damage. And The Boys Escaping. (Should they somehow permeate the      locked door and drag 7 kg of excess mass up onto the windowsills). I’m      glad SG was aware that his prisoners must be as desperate to escape as his      contract described.
* The heating was to be turned on for at least an hour everyday to prevent damp (midst of summer? Tough titty)
* No guests or visitors. If absolutely essential that a guest visits, the      landlord must be given a week’s notice.
* Absolutely no ‘sleepovers’.
* All housemates to be in by 10pm.
* The living room is out of bounds.
* The pantry is out of bounds.
* The bedroom must be hoovered and dusted weekly (and bathroom – but mopped, disinfected and descaled). However, Mrs SG will enter during working hours to ensure expectations are met. If not, she will implement additional measures herself (I could tell when someone had been in my room, but there had definitely been no cleaning going down. See – Part 1, Blonde Carpet. I can say though, that the bathroom was always spotless and there wasn’t much for me to do except wipe down the bath once I’d used it).

There were many more rules that evade me – but these are the ones that stick at the forefront of my memory. There were also lots of smaller, creepy incidents with SG. I’ll have a reluctant delve around my skull again this weekend, and might include them as part of the ‘escape’ entry.

I hope you guys have a lovely weekend!

Otherwise if you’re intolerant to the ingredients used to recreate the memories, understood, but I refuse to tamper with the recipe.

*Ps I am a sensitive sissy so please be kind.*

So! I left off last time where I’d been in the Beetus Prison for approx. 24 hours, and I was about to go off on a first date.

Now, using the shared bathroom was not ice I was keen to break. Given my reluctance to use bathrooms belonging to my own family, to this day I haven’t a clue what possessed me to enter a house-share in the first place. Growing up in this awkward, paranoid generation, I’d double-checked that the use of the bathroom was included in ‘the package’ (on the SnareShrooms ad, since SG still hadn’t had the opportunity to draft a tenancy agreement), which I then triple-checked with SG himself. *Am I allowed* to *use the facilities I’m paying for*?

Me: ‘The thing is SG, I have plans this evening, so will I be okay to use the shower later?’

He paused. ‘What are you doing?’

Me: ‘…Meeting someone’

SG: ‘A Tinder date?’

**WTF WHAT WHERE WHEN WHY WHO**

Me: ‘Yeee-sss?! I’m meeting him around 7pm, would I be okay to use the shower around, say, 5:30pm?’

SG ground his jaw. ‘I have a cleaner coming in later’

Me: ‘When?’

SG: ‘This afternoon.’

Me: ‘But what time? I’m worried about not being able to get ready’

SG: ‘I’ll let you know’ he said, swaying towards the garage (where he stored his nephew and video games), rocking as one would if attempting A-B on a boat in gale-force winds.

Even then, I smelt a rat. Especially once Banished Guy confirmed, there had never been a cleaner visit once throughout his year-long sentence.

As it happened, a young representative showed up from the local cleaners, honestly around 6pm in the evening. I paced the bedroom fitfully. Unable to hold off any longer, I politely asked the cleaner if he’d mind taking care of another part of the house whilst I dived in the bathroom for 10 minutes? With upmost reluctance, he retreated and activated Henry Hoover.

However, shower over, I realised that the ankle-deep, (head)hair-lined water wasn’t draining, and there appeared to be no obvious obstruction (my hair is thin, crappy, and still gets everywhere, so hell knows what it’s like for you lucky Rapunzels out there).

Deep breaths. I reasoned I could buy time with a blow-dry, and before returning to collect and dispose of any shedding. Mortified, I apologetically warned the cleaner - telling him to knock if the water still hadn’t gone down in the next 15 minutes, and I’d jug it out (?!) Running late, I rushed to my room.

Not 3 minutes later, there was a rapping upon the bedroom door. I turned the (redundant) lock and found SG whinnying behind it, key poised.

‘Darrrrrling –‘ He brayed ‘Can I show you something? Come with me’. Whilst one flipper digested my shoulders, the other pushed open the bathroom door and pointed forth. ‘Now – \***Girl I’m sharing a bathroom with**\*! Come here!’

My new housemate appeared apologetically, and I realised he was pointing to the (almost DRY) bath tub, sparsely lined with my hair. Absolutely livid that he’d tried to make a spectacle of me, I shrugged him from around my neck.

SG: ‘This is unacceptable.’

Me: ‘You’re absolutely right’ I said. ‘I was waiting until the water drained to clean the tub. I’d never leave it like that. I literally just told the cleaner I’d be right in.’

Clearly not anticipating a rebuttal, SG instantly cowered and began bleating apologies as I daubed about with multi-surface wipes.

‘That wasn’t cool.’ I said to SG, hurrying back into my cell. I was so embarrassed that the girl with whom I was bathroom-sharing, had already gotten such shoddy impressions of me within 24 hours.

Meanwhile, I’m late to the date. Once dressed and running down the road-I-didn’t-even-know, oh I was tardy alright. En-route, Tinder Date 1 - the first of many an ill-matched meeting - called to ask if I was going bother to turning up.

On arrival, we discussed utterly average things. It was the epitome of a non-descript encounter, neither good nor bad - all up until we parted ways for the final shuttle train, and I received a Whatsapp to inform me that he’d made his adjoining train connection – and that he liked things up his bottom.

I unsuccessfully entered the front door (lol) despite being as inconspicuous as possible. Whatever the grease-guzzler had done – my key proved insufficient negotiation for re-entrance. I removed my key and tried the next on the ring.

But then – I could hear that splatter down the hallway – akin to a cantering walrus - and sensed the atmosphere shift. The fuck? There were no lights on, had he been sat waiting in the kitchen? In the dark? Suddenly the door opened.

SG: ‘How was it?’ SG whispered, as I urgently made for the stairs toward my cell, groping for the banister in the pitch black.

Me: ‘I am so sorry – did I wake you? Oh my god I am so sorry SG. It was fine, thanks.’ I whispered.

SG: ‘I’m sure he was overwhelmed’.

It was such an OTT turn of phrase, I’ve never forgotten it.

I paused. ‘I don’t think I’ll be seeing him again. Goodnight.’

I made it to my room as quietly as possible, completely mortified. I awaited SG’s lolloping ascent to the marital bedroom across the landing – but nothing happened. And then I heard the microwave.

Now, I already felt totally idiotic when Banished Guy pointed out ‘Mrs SG’s bedroom’ the night I arrived, and it dawned on me that, holy fuck, I’d unknowingly signed up for a house-share with live-in landlord and lady. Despite being told the bedroom along the landing belonged to only the wife, I assumed with them being married, it must belong to both.

As I’m one of those awful people with little energy for social interaction, (especially of an evening when I want to just come home and slump in my dressing gown), the thought of having to fit into a family household was too much.

Was there a curfew I’d somehow missed, this evening? The date’s cocktails worked their magic and I fell asleep – to be woken again at 4am the ping of the microwave. Little did I know, this habit would become so engrained into my soul, that I still wake between 3-4am every morning and read for an hour.

In the days that followed, I’d help my Dad with work. Returning one evening, I tried to slink around the front door and up the stairs as usual; to no avail. I can only compare attempting to access that door unseen, to alighting a box of fireworks in a library without drawing attention to yourself.

SG’s vile tones reverberated through the ajar garage door. I was instantly summoned, where I found him spilled on the floor beside his startled nephew. I’d come to realise that Nephew always looked shocked and disturbed – probably because he was. But he had that effect on you that made you double check with ‘Are you sure?’ whenever he answered a pleasantry.

Anyway, in I trailed, lamb to slaughter. SG barked at Nephew to remove the box of Mountain Dew from the spinney chair he’d just pulled out for me (‘The kids all come trick or treating here, to get their hands on these’ #spreadthebeetus) to take a seat in front of an old PC.

Now predictably, I’d been having issues with my sim card. How this lead to being coerced into entering my passwords/email address to that Apple Macintosh to ‘sort it out’, I do not know. But suddenly I am in the hot seat, fingers dithering over the crumb-encrusted keyboard, pretending to have conveniently forgotten all logins, ever, since they were all automatically saved to my handset. Excusing myself, I scurried upstairs for a false skype chat.

‘I’ll be out all day tomorrow by the way’ I called.

‘You need to get this phone issue sorted because I don’t like being unable to contact my own tenants’ SG yelled after me.

In the days that followed, a sense of déjà vu set in, where I’d stay out the entire day and return to SG - uppity at the fact I refused to become a fellow shut-in. My avoidance only made things worse.

‘I want to know who I have in my home’ SG growled through my bedroom door. ‘I’d like to take you to lunch’.

I was suitably aghast at the idea. There seemed absolutely no option other than to accept. I reasoned that I was being difficult, spoilt, and one lunch was doable. It’s also worth noting, that I hadn’t had a hot meal in days, because in trying to spend as little time possible in the Beetus Hub, I ate cold foods that could be grabbed from the fridge and run up to my bedroom - if I were to eat in the house at all.

That’s not to say SG hadn’t kindly offered his culinary delights to me should I accidentally walk in mid-batch. Using a ladle to catch the bobbing chicken nuggets from a bubbling vat of oil, (which were the readymade nugget variety – so he’d be battering batter), he’d use them to garnish whatever pizza or curry sat waiting nearby. ‘Want one?’ he’d ask, ladle aloft, leaving oily debris on himself and the kitchen floor, silently but aggressively being mopped by Mrs SG.

What I’m saying is, I talked myself into these lunch plans based the promise of a hot meal, and a chance to prove my creep-detecting instincts wrong.

Meanwhile, Banished Guy had asked to meet for a drink the following night, since his office (of which I failed to attain a role) neighboured a quaint pub. I decided that worst case scenario, in attending The Lunch, I’d at least have an ‘interesting’ topic to bring to the pub.

On the day of the event, as we surpassed the arranged time by 90 minutes, I breathed a sigh of relief, guessing SG had forgotten our lunch plans, and I was consequently caught sneaking toast into my bedroom. Omitting a dissatisfied wail – SG frogmarched me to incontinent Weeble Wagon, it’s engine spluttering in the driveway, and as close to the front door as possible without taking out the doorstep. I’d already ruined everything. He’d wanted us to have a long and languorous lunch. How could I have insulted him, by quelling my hunger early? Cutting short our binge? Sadly, SG’s disgust proved impotent to his appetite for me.

SG: ‘You look beautiful’ he said as I trailed over the threshold.

I hadn’t even bothered to wash my hair. I was wearing the top I am as I write this – a cotton-knit, white v-neck t shirt. It’s one of those things you throw on when you cannot stomach the idea of putting an outfit together properly. You don’t know whether you’re too hot or too cold. The point being, I definitely did not fit the bill of ‘beautiful’.

He’d upcycled his carrot-bottom sweatpants/Timberlands with an untucked shirt.

Within seconds we’d reached our destination. A dank car park, whereby he paused to tell me I was funny. Which was ‘Rare in a woman’.

Me: ‘Thanks’

SG: ‘It means you’re intelligent. I’d only have people I’d employ myself living under this roof’.

Me: ‘Speaking of which – where are the other girls? I only ever catch Banished Guy on the stairs?’

SG: ‘I told you – working.’

It transpired of course, that the other girls did as I did, and fastidiously stayed out of the house until the last second, or didn’t come back at all, choosing to stay with friends or boyfriends until their own tenancy contracts expired.

I found it incredibly difficult to practise ‘heel’ on the way to the restaurant, due to the fact SG waddled so very slowly. He was on a mission to convince the public we were an item, by guiding me via a moist mitt to my lower back, along the (single) path to the front door. I writhed like an entrapped rodent throughout the entire ordeal – though one nauseating moment eclipsed all others.

I’d chosen pasta with a side of salad. No starter. Again, SG was temporarily riled.

SG: ‘I enjoy my dates where we …enjoy each other. For an entire afternoon and evening. That was naughty’ he whined, like a petulant child.

Me: ‘Good job this isn’t a date, then’

Wrong answer. SG raised his eyebrows. ‘There is so much more to relationships than sex. Even if it’s amazing…’

I froze, absolutely petrified by where this could be going.

He continued - ‘It’s the experience. I’ve dated many girls, taken them out, treated them as gentlemen should. Women should be clean and tidy. Women should look after the home. And men should reward them.’

I made agreeable sounds whilst shaking my head.

SG: ‘Which is why, I wanted you to enjoy our date – properly’. He nodded towards my salad bowl.

Me: ‘Would you like some?’

SG: ‘God no – if I wanted greens I’d ask for them. This meal is balanced enough’ he said, scraping a sprig of parsley from his carbonara mountain to a napkin. I laughed.

The confused look on his face told me he hadn’t been joking. I shut up and instead pondered where all of this ‘dating’ had taken place.

Mr and Mrs SG had an arranged marriage aged 18, he’d explained. No wonder Mrs SG was so utterly depressed, as he filled her home with young women. Young women, Banished Guy later confirmed, that had been chosen based on their profile picture on Snare Shrooms.com. (Banished Guy had been assured that not a single male would enter the Beetus Prison once he’d met the end of his tenancy. ‘Bringing boys in was my greatest mistake’ SG had declared.)

Back to the lunch table.

SG: ‘Of course – Mrs SG has never had to work. She chooses her employment at Europe’s Largest Tesco Store because she’s bored. All of her friends laugh at her, with her merc and her personalised number plate’.

There is no way in fuckery Mrs SG had friends. Understandably, she wouldn’t know a smile if it slapped her about the face. Which is honestly completely plausible given the hell in which she’d been forced to live. I wish, and I hope that she does/has found the strength to leave. But then she must know that the continuous loop of oil-drenched dishes are nipping hours off SG’s lifespan with every shovelling mouthful.

With most of SG’s pasta troughed, I was told, not asked, to try it.

Me: ‘No, really SG, thanks but I’m intolerant to er, that-’

Wrapping the glistening carbs around his fork (that had already been dunked in and out of in his yeasty laughing tackle), he began slowly soaring it toward my mouth. We had quite an audience by this stage. They’d been ‘discreetly’ observing already – I assume to figure out the relationship between this young woman and this obnoxious swine waving down waiters.

Me, again: ‘No SG, please, thanks but I really can’t-‘ in complete and utter shock, my mouth hit the table – orchestrating the perfect opportunity to deliver the spaghetti cargo. He maneuvered the fork edge to snare any basil escapees from around my mouth, before releasing them to his own gaping, thick-lipped dustbin.

""Are you gay?"" It wasn't the first time I heard this question. I was a tomboy and didn't date which obviously meant I was a lesbian/s. It was always because I ""talked"" and ""acted"" like a guy and ""never seemed interested in guys"" (I never seemed interested in girls either btw). I wasn't very surprised by the question, just by the asker.

All my friends knew I was straight and I mentioned to everyone that I was asked about my sexuality a lot and that the fact it was based on stereotypes bothered me. That people assumed my sexuality just because I wasn't ""girly""/I was too ""masculine"". Everytime I was asked that question it made me more and more insecure. I felt too masculine to like guys/date and that there must be something wrong with me. That insecurity made me not want to date which made more people think I was a lesbian.

EVERYONE IN MY FRIEND GROUP knew asking me about my sexuality was a touchy subject even if I acted fine with it. So to be asked that by a friend that KNEW I was straight? Pretty fucking annoying.

Me: ""No Hama, I am straight. I thought I told everyone that.""

Hama: ""Well yeah, but I didn't really believe you. You're sure you're straight?"" 

Me: ""Yes, why would you think I was lying?""

Hama: ""Just the way you act. You're really butch, so I just figured you were joking.""

Me: ""Well regardless of what you think, I am actually straight.""

And the conversation ended there. She never brought it up again. HAAHAHAHAHAHAH yeah right.

On an almost weekly basis I'd get asked by Hama ""are you sure? Like really really sure?"" And always my answer was ""Yes, I am straight.""

Then, one day this happened,

Hama: ""If you weren't straight I'd totally date you.""

Me: ""What about your boyfriend (of 2 years that you've been fawning over for the last week)?""

Hama: ""I'd dump him."" 

Me: ""oh... Well I am straight after all, so you don't have to do that.""

Hama: ""Just letting you know."" 

And we never spoke about it again... HAHAHHA God I wish guys. I really do. This psycho would bring it up weekly. That she would date me and break up with her boyfriend for me. This psycho bitch that frequently talked shit about me and my body, was straight up harassing me. 

Some notable exchanges were when she implied I was in the closet because of how ""adamant"" I was about being straight. She also implied I was homophobic because I said ""I am straight. I am so straight if I were a guy I'd be gay. That's how much I like guys more than girls. I do not want to date a girl."" After that she'd say ""If you weren't sO straight then-"" and talk about the life we could have together or dates we could go on. As though the only thing stopping us from having a perfect life was my darn sexual preferences.

We had gym class together and I always changed in a single shower stall because I was uncomfortable undressing with others. The one day I decided I would try it out and step out of my comfort zone? She *stared* at me the whole time I was changing. Not even making conversation just *staring*. I kind of turned away from her and avoided eye contact. 

(Senior year)

She escalated it further, she started talking about how she couldn't beLIEVE I was a virgin. Especially with all the attention I got from guys (see part 3). She started talking about that quite a bit. Would be hella loud when she did too. Thankfully Ari (see part 1) heard this when we were all 3 hanging out together. She pointed out a large portion of our friend group were virgins as well as Hama (saving herself for marriage, big oof later on with that) and it wasn't that weird for me to be a virgin since I was single and didn't seem that interested in talking about sex.

Hama said something like ""It's just weird that she never talks about guys. If she likes guys so much then name one she actually likes."" Ari being my main confidant knew the guy I liked went to a school I used to go to and said his name. My face turned red and Hama just said ""Fine! It's still weird she's not even dating anyone!"" 

I thought it was done. I really did. I was so innocent then. A few weeks without any talk from Hama about my sexuality and I was thinking it was finally over. Till in science class I was sitting there minding my own fucking business and hear a very familiar question,

""Are you a lesbian?"" I turned to see a random ass guy I never spoke to, but was in my class.

Me: ""No?""

Him: ""Oh, but you're bi, right?""

Me: ""No, I'm straight dude.""

Him: ""But aren't you're dating Hama?"" Literally all of my wat

Me: ""No we're just friends. I'm straight and she has a boyfriend. And even if I was a lesbian I wouldn't date her."" He looked hella confused almost as much as I felt.

Him: ""Oh, okay?"" And he went back to his seat.

Apparently someone had spread rumors about me and Hama dating. And that's the story of how my entire class thought I was a lesbian chubby chaser.

And if you're curious: it did get spread around eventually that we weren't dating but people still were very confused about if I was a lesbian or not. I'm still not sure if it was completely cleared up, but I'm in a different state now and don't really give a shit.

Edit: And if you're wondering if she kept harassing me even after all that happened? Yes. It went on almost the entire time I knew her. Which is why the range of ages

fatpeoplestories,"I thought I would follow up to my first post regarding my coworker dubbed Wheezy-Ham, which you can find here:

Today happened to be a really lovely fall day where I am.  Sunny and cool but not cold, just with that fall brisk in the air.  It's my favorite weather because I can get by with wearing a light sweater and be all comfy-cozy.  So our office is surrounded by windows, letting in all the great fall sunlight.  My (cool) coworker and I leave our blinds open to bask in the nice, warm sun.  However Wheezy closes hers as it is too hot.  Fair enough, they're her blinds.  However, she then proceeds to turn the fan on that we have in our office for the summer months (which I think it totally unnecessary, but that's another story). So here I am, someone who is always on the cold side of the body temperature scale, trying to stay warm by drinking all of the hot drinks while she fans herself in a t shirt.  Of course, she immediately went down to our break room to get food from our lunch vendor as soon as they were here.  That was about 11am, and now she's taking her second lunch at 1:30.  I'll spare you the details of the eating noises that come from her work station...for now.  ",Wheezy-Ham and the mildly temperate day.
fatpeoplestories,"FTP, I’m not gonna do the whole ‘be, don’t be’ character introductions, because if you’re anywhere near as impatient as me, you’ll skip that (and probably this).

The humour in this tale was entirely lost on me only until recently. It’s been over two years and I can finally, just about recall events without screaming into a pillow for 45 minutes.

The story begins after some personal trauma taking place in my \***very small**\* birth town, had me book several flights, a few B&amp;Bs, not enough clothes - to fly over to a chocolate-box pretty village on the mainland. Why this village? Well it looked cute didn’t it? Twee. And father, step mother and baby brother were only a stone’s throw away. I’d decided the best move, would be a permanent one to an entirely new place, new faces.

So when I arrived in the midst of summer, to the patriotic bunting slung from roof to roof of the ‘Joules’ and ‘Cathy Kidson’ and ‘Hobbs’ shops, the charming barista in Pret A Manger (A blatant Henry) had sealed the deal by saying he liked living there.

I’d only signed up to a website that rhymes with ‘Snare Shrooms’ 24 hours earlier, and had found a room just too good to be true. The average house share was over £750 and a while from the town. This, was £550 a month for a clean and modern new build – a 5 min walk from the town centre/train station, and promised a few ready-made ‘professional’ housemates’ my own age. I sat in Starbucks, (the novelty not yet lost on me – we don’t have one in my hometown), and hooked up to the Wifi to fire the landlord a message.

‘I can visit now?’ I typed.

‘Sure’ He replied – including the address.

I flagged a taxi.

We arrived only a couple of minutes later, to a lovely red brick cul-de-sac, all neat gardens and squirrels. Ringing the doorbell, there was a quick splatter of footsteps to the front door, and it opened to reveal a somewhat squat gentleman (we’ll call him SG) wearing Superdry, carrot-fit grey joggers. They shrieked impossibly under his steaming fupa; breasts clinging to his distended hernia under his damp t shirt. He welcomed me, the epitome of friendly, flamboyant, hospitality, to his perfectly kept abode. Incense whispered up the hallway from the kitchen; elephant men legends with several arms watched over us from golden frames.

A nauseatingly large barrel (that had been born a kitten) trundled its way past me, it’s monstrous gut swinging; a vision of feline defeat.

‘Go upstairs and wait in the first room on the left’ he drawled, handing me a savoury, wet key. ‘I haven’t finished the other viewing yet.’

He was so plummy, so camp, I (wrongly) pinned him as gay. Wishful thinking is such a soothing alter ego.

Following his directions, I happened upon a cream room overlooking the other gingerbread houses. Apart from the odd rumbling plane, and tinkling bicycles with streaming handlebars, all was quiet as was well.

Course blonde hair had woven its way into the carpet, and a lone perfume bottle perched on the bedside table. A small box of foundations and eye pallets peered from the open, otherwise empty wardrobe. The last tenant had clearly been here a while but had moved on quickly.

I don’t know what it was – but there was something about the way the room had been vacated that left a bitter taste in my mouth. I just couldn’t put my finger on what was amiss. But then my intuition had failed me endlessly throughout my life.

No sooner had I been sat on the stripped bed; did I hear heaving great thumps up the stairs. SG peered around the door. ‘What do you think?’ he wheezed, standing side-on in the doorway, palms acting as suction pads on the adjacent walls to keep him afloat.

‘It’s gorgeous!’ I cried. ‘Where are the other housemates?’

‘They’re working’. He barked, his horsy teeth chomping, head tilted backwards so he was addressing me from his chin. ‘Let me show you around.’

Following him, I could feel his warm and damp (bare)footprints on the carpet through my socks. I walked on outside edges of the stairs. SG ‘swept’ me into the kitchen, showcasing his heavily stocked wine fridge. Only it was fit to burst with boxed champagne.

‘Ooooh \*ex housemate\* always used to be cheeky and snaffle some of this' he trilled. ‘I’ll be watching you!’

‘Oh I don’t drink really’ I claimed, still in ‘best first impressions’ mode.

‘Me neither - I’ve never had a single drop of alcohol in my life.’ I looked at the red thread knotted around his wrist and the godly idols on various walls and shelves. I didn’t pry.

SG slid open the patio door. There sat the suicidal, morbidly obese cat. ‘That’s one of The Boys. We have two.’

‘We?’

‘Myself and my wife’ he mumbled. Phew. If not gay, at least he was married. Even then he must have been omitting some level of creepiness for me to so badly want him to either bat for the other team or sworn to holy matrimony.

‘Allow me-‘ he paused mid-sentence to wipe his entire head and neck with a towel. ‘to introduce you to Dee’.

As I followed, I noticed that all doors were fastidiously kept closed. Picture Nicole Kidman in The Others – as an Asian, 30 stone male without a gas lamp. Slugging from one door to the next, shuffling a caretaker’s key ring.

Opening the living room door, he waved his glistening flipper to two life-size portraits; one of himself and presumably his miserable wife with a millennial, curtained David Beckham (“*There’s Dee*!”) and another, the same only with Emma Bunton. I would soon recognise the second as SG’s Whatsapp dp.

‘Oh David Beckham?’ I queried sheepishly, absorbing the Madame Tussards waxen figures.

‘Yes – we call him Dee’ he cooed ‘we met him at one of the charity events we were invited to’.

Honestly? His name dropping silenced the dripping paranoia briefly. A mass murderer wouldn’t be schmoosing with celebrities, would he?

I boxed the visit off, saying I needed to return to town. I had another viewing to make within the next half hour, neighbouring Lego Land. It was then that SG insisted on driving me there himself. He beckoned me after him whilst waddling towards the seeping Merc; it’s fluids leaving a telling snail trail. I thought it an incredibly kind gesture and thanked him graciously.

He said he’d let me know who he’d chosen for the room later on in the evening.

A week later, myself and my dad pulled into the diesel-streaked drive of SG’s Krib. We alternated between the boot and the bedroom until the blonde-woven carpet became invisible under overstretched bin liners.

I was desperate for my dad not to leave, once we’d finished sushi in town. I’d dragged the feast out for as long as possible. I couldn’t figure out what was up with me as I am always perfectly happy in my own company, so chalked it up to the fact I was in a new city. Although I’d lived in so many places prior to the ‘UK move’, in various states of sharing and soloing, this all felt horribly off. The first time I was able to confidently put my finger on what it was that was ‘off’, was the moment I realised I was staying in coffee shops until closing. Anything to stay out of the house.

The same day I moved in – so did another girl right opposite my bedroom door. In a bizarre twist of fate – she was (my birth town) originated, and her birthday was the same day as mine. We’d be sharing a bathroom. The door to the right of hers belonged to a girl called 'A' who was rarely there – and to the right of 'A’'s, what transpired to be SG’s wife’s bedroom. There was then a final door to the attic – where the only unrelated male tenant was banished. It transpired that my first job interview was at his work place. He was lovely, Banished Guy. He was a triathlete and helped go through my application on the eve of my interview. I didn’t get the job. In fact, my brain was wiped clean of my debit card pin number that morning, so I couldn’t actually withdraw money to get to the office. Now I digress – there was a final Banished Boy in the garage. SG’s nephew.

And the weeble himself? He lived in the kitchen pantry. No, I’m not joking. He had a bed shoved in the pantry, where he slept when he wasn’t sounding the microwave the entire night.

Now I really did throw myself into embracing the anonymity of UK life. Within 72 hours I had a tinder date lined up at a cocktail bar in the village train station.

And there came the first passive-aggressive run-in with SG.

fatpeoplestories,"At my high school school, I’m involved in the school drum line. It’s an awesome program to be apart of and requires strength with your core and back to carry the drums. 

This year we had a freshmen girl join the line. For her age, she is really big. And I don’t mean this in a rude way, but to put it plainly she is fat and I wasn’t sure how this was going to work. Her brother is in drum line with us, but he has been working hard to lose weight and he’s doing really well.

The girl on the other hand not so much. First day out I tried being nice. It was okay but she has an attitude. Further down the time line, she starts complaining ALL THE TIME about her weight. We tell her to be positive but it just continues. Months go on and it seriously doesn’t stop. She’s mad because she’s not losing weight but she can barely carry her drum without breathing very heavy. I get it. It can be tedious and the show we are doing is lengthy, but she thinks she can just lose weight weight by 3 days a week band practice. 

Time goes on and she starts getting more rude. She’s called me a skinny bitch on multiple occasions and I’m not the only one she’s said it to. 

Here I am today, still with the same girl who never stops complaining about being fat but yet does nothing. What do people expect? I’ve tried encouraging her when she wanted to be nice and eventually I left her alone when it wasn’t working. 

Are these types of people common? She’s just the only person that’s over weight that I’ve met that acts like this. It drives me nuts. I have taken in thought that she is a freshmen in high school and isn’t mature, but it’s getting to a point where I’m confused why she won’t do anything about it.

Sorry if any of this came off rude. I don’t really know how to post about this. It’s just been bothering me for months and the story is still continuing.

UPDATE: I explain to my percussion instructor what was going on. Unfortunately, we all kind of expected this behavior for her, but he is going to talk to her. ",Band member always complains about her size yet does nothing
fatpeoplestories,"Many times throughout the years I knew her, Hama would make comments about guys. She'd always go for fit/tall guys with lighter hair. Any guy that fit the description she would ""dibs"" and when she showed interest and the guys showed disinterest she would act like someone broke up with her. All while having a long term boyfriend (2 years together when I met Hama). He was homeschooled and all this happened at school. 

This story takes place when I was a senior (currently 22): 

Me ""Mymass"", 17 years old, 5'3 maxed out at 126 lbs before submitting to an eating disorder and dropping down to 106 (technically still a healthy weight, but the amount I lost in the time frame was very unhealthy). Idk if this was before or after the ED, but it definitely didn't help. Small boobs, lost my butt in the ED. Not as fit anymore due to depression. (Currently working on it again, I really lost myself for a few years)

Hama, 17 years old 5'8 pushing 250lbs. Small boobs and butt.

After awhile she ended up crushing on a guy we had a mutual class with. We was a pretty nice dude and attractive, but I didn't ""like-like"" him. Hama however, thought he was the sun and stars. He was a transfer student from Germany. It turned out we also had a study hall together (big room and before then we always sat on opposite sides of it without knowing). 

After we noticed him I went over and asked him about the homework that we got that day. I knew Hama liked him and figured if they were friends she'd talk about him like he was a human and not some immaculate being  created for her. Anyway, he said he'd looked at it but hadn't started the homework and then said he'd rather listen to music, he played some and( suddenly pulled me in for a romantic and slightly sexual dance! Hahahaha fuck no, but you'd think some shit like that happened with the aftermath I had) the table of people (about 5 total including me) started talking about music. He liked **Electronic music with few vocals because it was less for him to have to figure out/learn. I recommended a few songs from daft punk. 

Now a quick keep in mind: HAMA HAS BEEN HERE THE WHOLE TIME and there were others there that I talked to way more than the transfer student (since we liked the same bands and kind of went on a tangent together). It's not like I fawned over this dude for an hour. We talked about music, he'd play a recommended song then we'd ALL (sans Hama) talk about other songs to play.

The next day she was really quiet. I asked her why she was so quiet yesterday and that she finally had a chance to talk to the transfer dude she was so interested in. She went from quiet to loud real quick. Yelled about how she isn't like me and after yesterday she has NO interest in that guy. She then said something like ""you can have him! You obviously wanted him SO BADLY!""  All of my wat. I told her I was just trying to give her an opening to get to know him better. I didn't like him, he was not my type. She just kind of ""yeah right""ed and good God I wish that's where this ended. 

After that time her thinshaming escalated to slutshaming (was a virgin, and being called a whore due to my body made me hate it and REALLY helped my ED. I felt horrible about myself and was paranoid everyone else thought the same things.) she would also point out any and all attention I got from guys. Even shit that was just straight up her delusions ""you couldn't tell but he was definitely giving you bedroom eyes. I know."", ""Wow you guys sure talked for awhile, he must like you."" She would exaggerate every encounter till I started dismissing actual signs of interest from guys and am still very oblivious even now. In the back of my head I did the opposite, it was a constant battle of """"oh god he likes me"" and ""no he doesn't he's being nice"". 

The thing is, there's a mom way of saying stuff ""wow you have a friend of the opposite gender? When's the wedding!?"" Kinda shit, and then there's Hama. She always acted like it was the grossest thing in the world. Like I was going out of my way to flirt around her all the time with literally everyone. Like every thing she pointed out was my fault and I should somehow make it stop. I became paranoid of men. 

Please don't ask me why I believed her, I didn't, but it still put the thought in my head and when I was already struggling with mental health it was not a good combo.

This went on the entire time I knew her. Any guy I talked to was suddenly only interested in fucking me and it was ""SO OBVIOUS MYMASS"" even the guys I knew were gay only talked to me to get into my pants.  And despite that reality being fucking horrifying, to her it was all my fault. Not only did I deserve to never have a platonic friendship with a male, but I somehow brought it upon myself by existing.

I'm thankfully able to have normal relationships with guys now, but some actions that would normally be, ya know, normal make me uncomfortable still. Like hugs from guys that aren't my boyfriend.

Or any other mistakes. 

 

 


",What happened to the Twilard saga?
fatpeoplestories,"Theres a TL;DR at the bottom, this is one of those ""fat people have no sense of hypocrisy"" stories. 

Some context:

I'm not the thinnest gal around. F 5'5-5'6 145-147, and pear shaped so my thighs do save lives. I'm a fan of leggings, mostly because when in black they're very easy to pair with just about any top/jacket. I've struggled with what I think is some form of depression for years ( only recently have my parents agreed to arrange for me to see a therapist ), so I wear the same shirts and general outfits quite often. I force myself to put extra effort into personal hygiene, and I guess my lack of presentation in clothing is where it shows. 

That being said, due to my regular wear of leggings, I put a lot of effort into making sure that I do not present a cameltoe, especially because I am undeniably chubby.
I mentioned previously that my parents are what was stopping me from therapy, and that also comes into play with the actual fat people part of the story because I am still in high school. Therefore, they have a lot of say in what I wear. 

We are a semi affluent family particularly in the school system. Despite the fact that my mother works in a district an hour away from the school I attend, I am somehow constantly the subject of comment for people she's around. Mainly for my, I will admit, often raggedy appearance. 

The Actual Story:

My grandmother as I've always known her is a nice but rather heavy woman. She's a bit over my height ( so probably 5'7 ish ) but is obviously overweight, a lot more so than I, but nothing so heavy that it impedes her any more than being in her seventies ( maybe 230-250 ? ). She recently got a total knee replacement surgery, and since my brother went off to college and my grandfather is oh so busy messing about in his garage, I was the one helping her out for the first three days she was home. 

I wore a pair of leggings that had a couple small rips but one large half-sewn hole right above the knee. Technically they're my favorite pair, since my fashion taste is on the grunge side, but they are notably the only pair that has any holes. I will admit that the leggings I wear, and wore during this time, are on the thinner side but that was far from a conscious choice on my part since they were my mothers before I claimed them. I also, as stated before, avoided the major pitfall of thin leggings avidly.

But none of that mattered as last night my mom approached me and said we have to change up my wardrobe completely since my grandmother called me ""too fat for leggings"" and more hurtfully, ""Grotesque"".

Obviously, that has messed with my small amount of self esteem quite greatly. Especially since I've begun working out more regularly to lose the weight I've gained. 
It's been a lot to deal with and my main reason in posting this is that I want some third party opinions. Yes, I understand the argument of ""you know you're a bit fat, why bother with tight clothing"" and ""then just lose the weight and go back after"" but I am still a high school student that at the end of the day, values keeping up my 96 GPA rather than pleasing eyes. I didnt think my clothing mattered that much, especially since I've never been dress coded or assumed to not be of my stable financial status. 

TL;DR chubby possibly depressed girl gets called fat by overweight grandmother and now has to put precious effort into wardrobe because she's ""too fat for leggings""

Edit: apologies for my wall of text, I'm posting on mobile, and thank you to everyone being supportive and also those giving me realist feedback. I have decided to embrace a new wardrobe and hopefully get some thicker leggings that are up to standards. All of your experiences have made me feel less alone in my weight class, and I thank you for that. ",""" Grotesque """
fatpeoplestories,"My mom is obese. She eats so much shit food. She drinks SO much soda. She burps all the time because she drinks so much carbonated drink. On the other hand, she is a very good cook and can make many different kinds of tasty and healthy meals. She does still eat fast food a lot when we are out in town. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I used to be EXTREMELY self conscious of my weight. I've never been obese, and the heaviest I've ever been was at the very edge of what's considered ""overweight""; at that time (a few years ago) I weighed 143 pounds and was 5'2. Now, I weigh 125ish pounds and feel so much healthier, so I'm no longer self conscious. One of my worst fears is to end up obese like my mom and my relatives on her side of the family.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here comes a huge pet peeve: I'll be out with my mom and she'll drive through some fast food place to get coffee. She'll also get those gross-ass burgers that they sell for like three dollars or less. She'll ask me if I want anything, and I'll say no, because I don't want to eat that disgusting, gross-ass shit food. And then she'll say stuff like ""stop dieting!"" or ""stop starving yourself"" as if I'M THE ONE MAKING AN UNHEALTHY DECISION BY NOT GETTING A GROSS ASS BURGER. 

And then it makes me feel self conscious again, and disgusting. She accuses me of having an eating disorder by turning down gross food, while SHE'S the one with the eating disorder, in the opposite way.

My coworker runs our chapter of a national program aimed at sedentary retired women who need help increasing their bone density.  (AKA obese, sedentary old bitches). They lift dumbbells while seated in chairs.  Most of these women have known me for years.

Right before her class started, I had to ask her an important question about security.  I was speaking quietly with her in the center of the class participants seated in a circle around us.

Suddenly, this old ham shouts out, ""Stabfacenotback!  How can you even stand on those skinny legs?""

I glared over at her and continued my conversation.

She continued to call out remarks about my skinny legs, which brought everyone's attention to me.

I went over to her and said, ""It's just how I am.""

Then another ham from across the room goes, ""What's everyone talking about?  Her pants?"" as if making fun of my pants was acceptable.

And another ham says, ""No!  It's her skinny ass and legs!  Take a look at how skinny her legs are!""  As if they never saw the size of my legs before.

Then everyone starts rumbling about my physical appearance.

I felt mortified.  Angry.  No.  PISSED!

I walked out of the room.  They must've figured I was pissed because as I left someone said, ""I meant it in a nice way!""  And another said, ""You a lucky one!""

Whatever.

After the class, as I was leaving my shift, one of the thin class participants came up to me as the other hams were changing their shoes in the hallway, looking at us.

She said, ""Everyone told me to compare legs to see whose were skinnier!  haha,"" and she stood beside me.

I said, ""Don't let anyone skinny shame you."" And I gently elbowed her away from me.

As she trotted over to the others, she said, ""Your's are skinnier!  Haha!""

I went into the office where my co-worker was.  I loudly said, ""Can you believe this?  I would NEVER comment on someone's physical appearance like that!  Can you imagine if I lined everyone up to see who has the fattest ass?!  FUCK this!"" and I left, passing the stunned-silent herd.","I ""lost"" for being the thinnest."
fatpeoplestories,"Good morning r/fatpeoplestories! You guys were a huge part of my weight loss (F 5’4” SW:170 GW:120 CW:149) and have kept me on track all summer. I have a short 4 piece McFatlogic for you.

Most of my family is fat, including all of my aunts. I recently had dinner with one such Aunt, who is 5’4” and around 220 lbs (BMI 38). She asked what unexpected challenges had come from my weight loss.

I told her that clothes worry me. At 10 lbs overweight, I am comfortably wearing sizes S and XS. What on earth am I going to wear when I lose another 30 lbs? Vanity sizing is already becoming an issue.

She said that she had the OPPOSITE problem, and that vanity sizing made large women’s clothes smaller. She couldn’t fit into an XL, and she was “not even that big!”

I was squeezing into an XL at 170, which was my wakeup call. For my aunt though, it’s not that she’s way too big, it’s that an XL (which should be saying something already) is way too small.

fatpeoplestories,"Couple months back, out to eat with a group of friends.  We get seated, and in my unfortunately directed view there's a family of breathtaking girth, couple tables over.

fatpeoplestories,"Cast today: 
me, ""Mymass"", 16 years old 5'2.5 115lbs fit af decent butt and small boobs

Hama, 16 years old 5'8 200+lbs squishy af bowling pin shaped no butt and small boobs (she thinks are big)


So basically anytime Hama would compliment someone within the next few days she'd say a lot of mean things about their body or good things about her own. She was under the opinion that because I was thin I was swimming in male attention.

One day when we were walking to class together she said something like ""so yesterday I thought I saw a guy in our class check you out when you bent to get your stuff"" offhandedly, this was news to me since I hadn't gotten any kind of male attention this year at all. 

""Oh? Who was it?"" Hama seemed a bit surprised that I didn't act offended that a dude was checking me out.

""Oh that one guy, I don't know his name"" Well in her mind she just gave me a compliment, which obviously meant she had to not only take it back but try to make me feel bad about myself too, ""it doesn't even matter, since he wasn't actually looking at you. He was looking at your phone since it was about to fall out of you pocket. It did take me awhile to figure out what he was staring at, cuz you don't really have anything to stare at."" 

I'll be honest, I was pretty self conscious back then, but I still liked parts of myself. So while I couldn't be like ""bitch I have an amazing body, fuck off"" I did say something like ""Oh? I mean I like my butt, so it would make sense if some guys liked my butt too."" 

You'd think I just said ""I have two heads and some guys are into that"" with the disgust on her face.

""Guys that like butts over boobs are gay and too afraid to say it. Honestly guys that like butts. Are gross. Butts are gross. Boobs are great and the bigger the better-"" she stopped to looked at my chest ""I'm sure you'll find a guy someday""

I kind of ignored the blatant insult of my body and said something like ""so guys that like butts are gay and guys that like butts are gross, so are you saying gay guys are gross? I don't really understand your logic, people can like whatever they want. Some guys like feet, so why can't some like butts?"" We stopped outside our classroom to keep talking, since when we got inside we sat on opposite sides of the room.

She went on a full on rant ""guys should like boobs if they're straight, that's why we have them. To attract a mate. Real men like boobs like mine, Mymass, not boobs like yours. Mine are way bigger than yours.""

For the record, all I asked was ""Well what's your bra size?"" And she freaked the fuck out,

""Bra size doesn't matter! You can see just by looking at us that mine are bigger!"" I know why she freaked out, because my friend group was well aware of my cup size (B at the time) due to me getting sick of people (Hama) commenting on my ""A cups"" or saying ""there's literally nothing there right? You probably just wear padded bras to look like you have boobs."" Hama was actually an A cup and her bras we're constantly puckering or would just be open at the top and half full. 

I was done with the conversation, I just rolled my eyes and was about to walk in when she said ""and I'm Bi so I can't be homophobic!""

I thought that was the end of it, but over the next week the amount of times she made comments about how ""pitiful it is to be a girl without boobs"" and how ""it's like they aren't really girls, since they just look like little boys"" not only that but she made many many comments about how anyone under a certain Jean size was disgusting and probably an attention whore. The Jean comments were whatever, but I was very self conscious about my chest and hearing comments about ""skinny bitches look like little boys"" always really hurt. I didn't even date till my senior year since I genuinely felt unlovable and like guys that showed interest were just pranking me.

Hama and people like her piss me off. I never once heard anyone say anything to her about fat women being disgusting and only perverts wanting to date them, but that's the shit I got told about my body all the damn time. That ""only a pedo would date you"" (actually said to me) and that anyone under certain measurements were anorexics and gross.

2. I'm not ""sweetie dear"".  Thank you.

3. I'm not skinny!  I have a BMI of a gnat's hair under 21, which is right down the motherfucking center of the normal band.  I'm the size most people were in 1960.  Except, it's not 1960 any more, so now I look skinny to everybody.  The size medical science says is least likely to have health problems.

I do reckon normal body types are perceived as skinny because 1/3 of the country is overweight and another 1/3 is obese.  ""Normal"" is expanding faster than the circumference of our waistlines.

""You should eat another dessert!  You needs it!""

fatpeoplestories,"So a quick bit of explaining: this series is complete, this ended a few years ago and I don't know anything about Hama currently. All the stories happened between my junior year of high school and freshman year of college. She was recently brought back up and I felt like I had to get this out of my system.

Today's Cast:
Me ""Mymass"", 16 years old  5'2.5 115lbs fit af late puberty, so my boobs are small and always hurt to the touch, decent butt

Hama, 16 years old 5'8 200+lbs squishy af small boobs despite large size, looked like a bowling pin but also had no butt.

Arianna ""Ari"", 17 years old 5'2 115-120lbs slight squish big boobs, no butt


One day the three of us were walking down the hallway. I was asking Ari if she was sticking to the exercises I told her about and Hama started doing /the thing/. /The thing/ was whenever anyone smaller than Hama was doing something she didn't like she would get really close to them and lean over them to intimidate them into stopping. If you were talking to her directly she would tell you to be quiet/shut up and lean completely over you and way into your personal space.

Ari gets into fits of hating her body and I always try to help her by giving her really easy exercise routines that she can stick to. This was one of those times, so I was just checking on her progress. Hama didn't like me talking about exercise since she ""exercised all the time and never lost weight"". I wasn't scared of her, I had just moved from an inner city school and literally had a kid try to shank me and another shove me down a flight of stairs for no reason other than I was tiny back then (4'6 when that happened). She didn't understand she just looked like an edgelord to me and I went on with my conversation.

Eventually I mentioned hormones because Ari was on birth control and Hama perked up. She immediately went into a whole rant about her hormones being out of wack and eventually about her thyroid. I asked if she had gotten her test results back yet, since she had been talking about /finally/ getting it tested (had it tested twice before this). She looked frustrated and talked about how since she'd been eating healthier her numbers where better than they should be. I asked if it could be something other than her thyroid, I meant medically but apparently she thought I was talking about all the food she shoved into her face. She retaliated by elbowing me square in my barely there boob.

Honestly for me being elbowed in the tit is fucking painful and I swatted her squishy arm away blindly as I tried to get a few steps away from her. Ari went to my side and asked where Hama hit me. She must have noticed where I was grabbing because she turned to Hama and was about to start yelling when she just stopped. I looked to Hama and saw her doubled over clutching her stomach with tears streaming down her face. I then realized what I thought had been a squishy arm was just her squishy tummy.

Hama started cursing at me, shouting ""Why did you punch me Mymass? I barely even tapped you! You're a fucking bitch! You didn't have to do that!"" Ect. Before I could defend myself Ari was on her. 
Pointing her finger right in Hama's face ""Barely tapped? You fucking elbowed her you asshole! She pushed you away because you ELBOWED HER IN THE BOOB! PUSHED! You hit her way fucking harder than you got back. Why the fuck did you even do that in the first place? She didn't do anything!"" 

Hama being the crazy tub of selfhating lard she was cried ""she called me a liar and said I'll never lose weight cuz nothings wrong with me!"" Pretty sure Ari was about to call her out on that too, but I beat her to it.

To paraphrase I said ""I fucking asked if you had another god damn medical whatever since your fucking thyroid has been tested 3 God damn times. Fuck you and stop acting like I fucking decked you, you fucking psycho."" There may have been more curses but that's the gist.

After another minute of me cursing and her whining I told her to shut the fuck up and started walking with Ari to class. She threatened to go to the principal for me bullying her and I said to go for it ""you're twice my size and I have a witness. You really think they'll side with you over me?"" She shut up about it and never did /the thing/ ever again. She also would act like I was actually bullying her, which was just pathetic. She'd constantly try to ""out frail"" me and comment about how much stronger I was and that her hands were much tinier than mine. I think she wanted people to overlook her size and if there was another ""bullying"" situation pick her side since she was an innocent frail girl and I was a solid muscle of hate. Yeah, that never happened.

Funny thing is she constantly talked about how abusive her father was and that she'd be dead if it wasn't for her ""abs of steel"". That thanks to her abs she barely even felt ""the beatings"". That cps knew and wouldn't do anything because her dad had cop friends. Just for clarification I found out later FROM HER that she was making the physical abuse up. However she said it was because she was being so horribly abused emotionally that it felt like a punch to the gut all the time. The way she was abused? Her dad would call her a fatass or say ""this is why you're so fat"" when she'd eat someone else's food.

fatpeoplestories,"Just a Quick one. I took part in a shooting competition recently that involved running 25 meters to the shooting point (where the guns where left in safe condition). Shooting, then running back (without the weapon, which was made safe and left at the shooting point.) You then ‘tagged’ in the next person. 

Unfortunately  a lot of people in the competition are very overweight and got upset that we were putting in such good times because myself and my girlfriend are both able to run faster than everyone else due to not being overweight.  So to please the larger members the range officer Made up a new rule. ‘Everybody under 30 has to run twice’.  This was met with a lot of nodding from the overweight members, After all it wasn't their weight that slowed them down, it was their age and as we all know 'that is not their fault!'

So the next round happens and we only run once.     
“Guys, Your time doesn’t count. Anyone under 30 has to run twice”   
  
“She is 30, I’m 33. We just work out”.

* Jim: 43 yo, 6'3, 260 lbs  (190cm, 118 kg)
* April: 39 yo, 5'10, 280 lbs (178cm, 127 kg)
* Me: 59 yo, 5'8, 137 lbs (173 cm, 62 kg)

So Jim and April are a couple.  I'm friends with both but a lot closer with Jim who I've been hanging with for probably 18 years.

Me and Jim, we used to do all kinds of stuff together.  Hiking, kayaking, biking, climbing gyms, skiing, snowshoeing, you name it, we've done it.  Active stuff.  Good for ya, yeah?

I still do all of that, but since Jim and April became a couple, he... just... stopped.  Cold turkey.  April, who is ""a bigger gal"" doesn't want to do anything active, and she doesn't want him to either, without her.  Gets all kinds of mad.  Since she won't, ... now he won't.  I think it pisses off April because she's not able to do the things Jim and I liked to do.  That's despite being the youngest of the three of us, and despite that we sometimes include other friends and wives who are her age and they are totally able to hang with us.  One of said wives even smokes every single one of the guys when it comes to anything cardio.  She's the fastest of all of us on foot bike or skis.  A regular cardio animal, and she's only a year younger than April.  One year... and probably about a hundred and fifty pounds.

So... April would rather sit on the couch with an ice cream and watch TV show after TV show.  I've tried offering to do some easy activities just to include her.  Hey, let's all go take a mild little walk down this nature trail.  We'll tool along, and turn around when you feel like it.  Hey, let's go hit the state park and explore a little on foot.  Long or short as you want.  None of that is going to count as ""exercise"" for me, but I wanted to get her out doing something... anything!  But no... just ice cream and TV shows.  I've tried offering everything I can think of.

Well Jim, he's put on a lot of weight since his ""lifestyle change"".  He's a tall guy and naturally big, but now he's packing more pounds than is healthy, and he's going the wrong way fast.

Now I'm starting to get worried for the guy.  He gets winded going up a few flights of stairs.  Didn't used to: we'd go on epic 6 hour hikes together, tearing up the trails, and he was a beast.  You pack on too many pounds and it saps it out of you.  Heart attack risk, stroke risk, cancer risk, knee risk, and he's got a blood pressure problem going already.  On meds for it.  Cardio gone all to shit from years of inactivity.  You can get into a downward spiral with this.  Put on weight, get less active, put on more weight... round and round ya go.

I don't want to go all judgmental on the guy, and I don't want to get in the middle of their weird (kinda jacked up) couple dynamics.  But... he needs to drop some pounds, ya know?  This ain't good for him.  I mean, I love the guy like a brother, and I don't want to see him dead at 50 because his partner makes ""certain lifestyle choices"".  How can I approach something like this without coming across like a dick or ""taking sides""?  Not trying to get into the relationship councilor biz here.  I've already tried offering to do whatever, as tame as April feels like she's up for.  Literally, if she wanted to walk 25 steps down the nature trail and call it a day, hey that's a start!  Lather rinse repeat.  But she ain't having it, which means Jim ain't having it either.

fatpeoplestories,"Hello once again, FPS readers! Since a lot of people seemed to enjoy the Dragonfruit post, I figured an update was in order. 

Those unaware can find the [Original Story!](https://old.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/9kdb1p/apparently_i_lost_weight_to_behave_like_a_skank/) here.

**Cast:**

Me: Kinvara, 26 F, hit my goal weight of 130 lbs at 5'6 about 20 days ago after almost a year of sugar control, long walks, copious amounts of green tea, and swimming. Weighed 212 lbs at my heaviest in October 2017.


HotGuy: Gorgeous^droolworthy^Adonis. 28, 6'0, approximately 175 lbs of broad shoulders, trim waist and veiny-muscled arms. 


Dragonfruit: Our hamtagonist. 26 F, about 220-230 lbs at 5'3. Great at assessing skankiness, ordering people to get her food from the buffet table while she tried to impress HotGuy with her ~~amazingly impeccable~~ Game of Thrones knowledge. 


**New addition:**

VapidEx: My ex who dumped me after a relationship of several years because he wasn't attracted to me anymore when I got fat. 27 M, 5'10, approximately 180 lbs.


Onto the tale!

So after StringBean's (not in this story) engagement, Dragonfruit sped off in an Uber meant for four of us to share because apparently I had lost weight to be a skank and snag men who would otherwise be head over heels in love with her. My friends and I were gobsmacked by her behavior as we had never seen such a nasty side to her before. We still had to get home though, so we hired another Uber and after utterances of ""don't pay attention to her, she's just jealous of your weight loss"" by my friends, I got home. 


Kicked off those killer heels, took off the arty imitation jewellery and makeup, got into an oversized t-shirt and dozed off. After switching my phone to airplane mode.

That was a mistake. 


The next day was a Sunday and I am never, ever up before 11am on the weekends. Woke up groggy, turned the phone network back on, and it started buzzing away to an absolute frenzy. 

*what the heckin heck happened?*

I had received 136 messages from 12 conversations. Clearly, some shit had gone down. I opened WhatsApp to see messages from HotGuy, String Bean, some other friends who had attended the engagement, and *heeelllooooothere* Vapid Ex. 

Which one to open first?

Any guesses?

Well I opened String Bean's chat window first because sisters

Then I opened VapidEx's chat window. 

His exact words: ""Hey! I saw some of the pictures from String Bean' engagement on some Instagram stories. You looked gorgeous! And I was so glad and excited to hear you wanted to meet me. I was such an ass to you. I didn't know I still affect you so much though...Like were you seriously crying all the way back home?""

And then I opened HotGuy's messages.

His exact words: ""Kinvara, it was lovely to meet you last evening. I must apologise though since I came on too strong maybe. I must have seemed really predatory but that was so not my intention. I had no idea that you were fresh out of a relationship, obviously, it's too soon to date again. Once again, I had a lovely time but please do forgive me for being so forward.""

The other chats could wait. I instantly typed a response. ""Hi HotGuy, I don't really know what you are talking about. Can we speak over a call?"". His reply was almost instantaneous, that most definitely, we could.

I'll spare you guys the exact details of the conversation, but apparently Dragonfruit looked up HotGuy on Facebook the instant she escaped in the Uber and sent him a friend request. He accepted a couple of hours later because what was the harm, right? Wrong. So wrong.

She sent a barrage of messages the moment he accepted her request, first complimenting him. Statements like ""You are easily Beanstalk's handsomest friend!"" and ""You absolutely must try to get into modeling"" and ""The engagement was worth my while just because you were there. I was SO bored before I saw you!""


And then...

""So I noticed you were also speaking with Kinvara, God, she was interrupting our conversation SO often! She has always been like this. She can't stand to see me talking with a handsome guy. She thinks just because she is now a stick that she's such hot shit. She's just insecure. She was even heavier than me once, you know?""


Bitch even at my heaviest I was lighter than you while being three inches  taller.

HotGuy claimed to have said this: ""Hey no, not at all. She wasn't interrupting. On the contrary, I had a fabulous time talking to her and you (such a gentleman). And it's great that she managed to get so fit then, if what you say is true. I once weighed close to 280 lbs myself, so I know the struggle. In fact thank you for telling me this! Kinvara and I have more common ground than I thought""

Uh oh, bitch. Your plan to disgust him by harking back to my former fatty self suffered an epic fail.


She then tried another tack. She said something to the effect of:

""Oh is that so? I will warn you though, she is freshly out of a very long term relationship and still pines after her ex. She still stalks him on social media and in fact today in the Uber home, she was crying. She was jealous that String Bean is engaged before she is and that she thought VapidEx was her soulmate. She misses him terribly. Thought you should know this as you seem like a great guy and I don't want you getting hurt. She also said she thought you are creepy and was only being nice to you as you are Beanstalk's friend.""


HotGuy told me he was completely taken aback by this and thanked her for telling him. He had no idea I was so uncomfortable. Shortly after, he told her he was going to sleep and then he texted me.

I clarified that no, I most certainly was not uncomfortable with his attention and that my last relationship ended a year ago. He seemed relieved and actually let out a long ""**WHEW!**

I then told him to give me some time as I needed to sort some stuff out. He said sure and asked me to ping him later.

I then called up VapidEx. He was super effusive and gushy, the way he behaved in the first flush of the relationship. I got straight to the point and asked him what the hell his message was all about. 

Turns out Dragonfruit told him the same story with a customised twist: that I was crying in the Uber about how much I missed him, and that even a handsome man like HotGuy didn't make me feel like he did, and that I lost all the weight so he could take me back.

He ended with: ""It never was about the weight, baby. Of course I miss you terribly and want to patch up too. Let's meet this Saturday?""

Just to drive home my point about him dumping me for my weight, this is what he said to me before he broke up: ""You were so slim and trim back in junior college. Everyone stared at you and I felt so proud. Now no one looks at you. You've slacked off and don't want to be pretty for me anymore. I deserve better than this. I just don't feel attracted to you anymore, I am so sorry"" -- message dated Sep 28, 2017. 

Back to the present. I told him Dragonfruit was making up shit and that no way, I did not want to even hear his voice ever again. I disconnected the call while he was still blubbering something about soulmates and true love.

I decided to call Dragonfruit. Bitch was going to have it. Unfortunately she had blocked me on WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, everywhere. Her phone was switched off too. Bitch probably realised she'd taken her lying too far. I decided to leave the matter be.

Why? Because I got this text from HotGuy, that's why:

""Forget her, will you? I was just being polite by talking to her. It was you who had my full attention and I was not even afraid of making that clear. How about me meet for coffee at ReallyUpscaleCafetiere and I upload a picture of us together? That should show her ;)""


We are going on our first date tomorrow, gaaaaaiz! Wish me luck :)",Skanky me and Dragonfruit: An update
fatpeoplestories,"My previous stories were from the bloodbank but I now work at a horse rescue and encountered ham logic in the wild.

&amp;#x200B;

A woman (ShowjumpingHam) came in wanting to look at our horses because she's interested in adopting rather than carrying on at her riding instructor with a lease horse. I'd estimate her at a little over 100kg which doesn't sound as bad as some hams here but she's about 1.5m tall and basically looks like a beach ball stuffed into jodhpurs. She also wants to showjump.

&amp;#x200B;

My boss and I steer her towards the bigger thoroughbreds and crossbreds that would be up to carrying her weight but she stopped in her tracks and squealed (what is it with hams and squealing?) at the sight of a pretty little arab gelding. He's about 13.1 hands high which basically means he'd be a perfect child's pony but definitely not up to the weight of even a normal adult.

&amp;#x200B;

Boss gently tells ShowjumpingHam that he would NOT be able to carry her weight and we tried again to move past the paddock of ponies but then she opened her mouth: ""You don't understand, it's ok. I always use a numnah, a foam riser AND a sheepskin under my saddle. That way the horse doesn't feel my weight on his back at all!""

&amp;#x200B;

Boss and myself are both speechless at this point. Somehow she thinks that just because there are a couple of extra layers between her and the horse, her weight gets cancelled out!? My boss finally pulled herself together and informed ShowjumpingHam that gravity doesn't work like that and she wouldn't be able to home a horse to her. Cue rage and tears and storming off.",TIL that enough padding negates obesity
fatpeoplestories,"I have a roommate who's probably in his early 30's, not positive on his age, and morbidly obese. This dude is about 5'10, more or less 400 pounds. When he sits on the toilet, he leaves skin-cell imprints of his ass, welded to the pores of the toilet seat. Every now and then, I may see little spots of blood around the bathroom floor, leading to his bedroom.  


Today, I walked into the bathroom to take a piss, and I notice the floor-mats are gone. I had to piss like a race horse, so I ran in without turning on the lights, but turned them on post-relief. It was like a murder had taken place. Blood that indicated a fast pour from a wound, going down the outside of the toilet bowl. Same type of spurt of blood on the floor, accompanied by droplets. A smear of blood, indicating he tried to wipe one spot.... But he just left it. He bled all over the place AND JUST LEFT IT. I've been working on getting this man evicted for 2 months now, and hopefully this will be the nail in the proverbial coffin.  


But to anyone who has had experience with a morbidly obese person, what could be the cause of this sporadic bleeding?! I read that obese people's bodies are unable to provide sufficient.... moisture, I guess, to their grundle area. That it gets dry, chaffed up, and they just bleed. The initial little spots of blood could have been the result of that, but today's incident, it's like he was straight up stabbed, or his internal organs were giving out. I don't know. Anyone know what may be causing it to happen? I hate the guy, because he's a gross slob, but I'm also kind of worried that he's dying... but not worried enough to show compassion to him in person.",Obese roomate bleeding all over the place.

Maybe it was to justify the enormous quantities of food she downed every lunch hour?

Anyway, I had a friend on the swim team and she told me that Float Ham came to try out. Not bad, that's a healthy start. Well it turns out that she couldn't even swim. I'm not kidding, apparently she just jumped in and started drowning. She had to be saved, but it was too late. She died.

fatpeoplestories,"In my last story, I mentioned [Brenda, who believes that sugar is the best for growing babies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/9kfcd1/i_think_ive_just_won_a_game_of_pregnancy_fat/?st=jmqadhk2&amp;sh=8d9e72e3) Unfortunately, she's not the only one who shares this belief, and I've encountered a LOT. I think it could be a cultural belief in the country I was in (just moved for my husband's job &amp; to be closer to my doctors!). Here's one of the other times I encountered the same weird belief...


One of my friends happen to be pregnant at the same time as me, so we’ve been talking a lot, especially since it’s her 2nd pregnancy so she could answer a lot of my questions.

So a bit of a background about this friend. Ever since I knew her, she has always been fat. The only time she wasn't was at the first trimester of her first pregnancy, where she lost a lot of weight thanks to constant vomiting (serious enough for her to be medicated, apparently). She's not morbidly obese level, but definitely fat and her husband is definitely obese. It’s definitely diet related, because they eat crap all the time. A typical meal would be just mac &amp; cheese/KFC/pizza/ramen noodles/rice with furikake/buns/pastries....basically, carbs &amp; sugar heavy and generally nutrient poor.

There was a time when she was having a hard time, so I would help babysit her baby and eat dinners, and some lunches, with her almost daily for about a month. During that time, I actually started losing hair and breaking out big time. It freaked me out so much, that I started bringing my own meals. I did bring an extra large portion so I could share with her and her baby, but she would always decline and the baby was entering a phase where she rather eat baby biscuits than proper meals.

What confuses me is that they used to cook healthy meals for their baby, but as the baby grew older, her meals started to morph into her parents’ meals. It’s like they believe growing up means you can eat whatever crap you want.

Anyway, a few days ago, she messaged me to invite me for ice cream while I was in town for the weekend, and I had to tell her that I can’t really eat ice cream at the moment since everything started tasting wayyy sweeter ever since I got pregnant.

That’s when she revealed something that definitely freaked me the fuck out.

Apparently, her doctor keeps ""scolding"" her because her baby keeps growing bigger than it should. She suspects it’s all the “frappes and ice cream” she’s eating. But she “has to” eat them because she’s losing weight thanks to nausea and pregnant women ""aren’t supposed to lose weight"", and her husband would get upset with her if he found out she lost weight. She can’t eat much so this is how she could get “enough food” for the baby. She doesn’t even want to eat ice cream or drink frappes, but for the sake of her baby, she’s “forcing herself”.

**Basically, she’s currently pregnant and forcing herself to eat almost exclusively only ice cream and frappes.**

Yeah.

I did meet her briefly and it doesn't look like she lost any weight. She's still very chubby.

Her first child was also really large, and I always thought it was genetic, but she was now proudly telling me she made sure the baby was “big enough” by ""chugging frappes nonstop"". She lost ~9-12lbs in the first trimester (it brought her into the normal weight range for the first time ever) so she had to “counter the damage” and spend her 2nd &amp; 3rd trimesters consuming as much sugar as possible.

I hung out with her during her first pregnancy and I did notice she ate an ungodly amount of desserts and sweet drinks, but I thought they were treats for the rare moments she went out with friends. I didn't realize that was *all* she ate.

She did look extremely sick and unhealthy (sallow, papery looking skin, bad hollows under her eyes even after she became chubby again, looks tired all the time) throughout her first pregnancy, but I had chalked it up to having a rough pregnancy.

Ok. I'm all for judgement free pregnancies. You want coffee, go for it! Sashimi? Eat away! Marshmallows ease your nausea? Let’s make s’mores! I think pregnant women should be left alone to eat whatever they want and however much they want, BUT as long as a valid doctor has confirmed that everything's ok.

I told her that if her doctor thinks the baby is far too large, maybe it’s something to worry about. And if her doctor isn't worried about her weight loss, it's probably nothing to worry about. She doesn't sound convinced though.

I did ask her if she tried the nausea buster smoothie popsicle recipe (I'll post the recipe in the comments + a bonus gross story) I shared with her early during my pregnancy since that worked well for me and it's close-ish to ice cream, but she told me she ""just can't eat"". What.


Her first baby seems ok health wise. I'm only saying ok, because she does fall sick pretty often, to the point where I've suggested checking her up for an autoimmune. Then again, I'm not a doctor, I don't know how frequently kids get sick in this country, and I could just be paranoid because having an autoimmune myself means I have medical bad luck, so I'm always aware of when people are sick since every cold I catch becomes a big deal and can escalate into the medical worst case scenario –like a full blown lung infection (actually happened once). I've always assumed that kid may have a weaker immune system than usual because my friend had a really rough pregnancy; she nearly miscarried and was placed on a 6 months bedrest. Now I can't stop wondering if it's her mom's frappe diet.

I'm really, really hoping the 2nd baby one will be ok too.",Another pregnancy fat logic I encountered
fatpeoplestories,"So, I'm pregnant and apparently announcing your pregnancy invites all sorts of people to lecture you on everything you do. The advice I get are sometimes good, but often inane or insane (I'll add them in the comments), since the type of people who feel the need to lecture not so close friends/strangers are often also the type of people who believe they know more than everyone, including doctors. Yes, I've gotten tons of fat logic advice, obviously, but recently, I got hit by a combo of the Pregnancy Fat Logic Greatest Hits from a woman I'll just called Brenda, because Brenda is totally one of those ""let me speak to the manager"" names.

About a month ago (been too miserable to write), I got a message from an ex-boss, Amy. She was the best boss ever and I was really sad when she left to move out of town. Amy told me she was coming in town, asked if I wanted to grab lunch, and of course I said yes. Even though I've pretty much turned into a hermit thanks to extreme fatigue (autoimmune + pregnancy ftw!) and nausea, I'd gladly drag myself out for her. Unfortunately, Amy asked if she could invite Brenda along.

Brenda is a few years older than me and was actually pretty chill the first 1-2 years I knew her. Then, she joined the HR team and began morphing into one of those ""let me speak to the manager"" moms. Even with the hairstyle and all, I shit you not. She began feeling the need to lecture everyone on *everything* and I eventually started avoiding her and completely lost touch with her after I left the bank. 

Brenda and Amy were close since they were fad diet buddies, and to be fair, Amy left before Brenda's transformation into HR Bitch. Even before Brenda evolved into her final HR Bitch form, I've always thought Brenda &amp; Amy were bad together because they just constantly feed off each other's fat logic. Amy has always been large but Brenda went from slightly chubby to obese after she had her first kid and, like the galaxy, continued to expand. 

As much as I didn't feel like seeing Brenda, I just agreed because:

A) I know Amy's time in town is limited and she wants to meet as many friends as possible

B) Maybe Brenda has changed or I'm misremembering how annoying she was. It *has* been 5+ years since I last saw her...


LOL. You all know how this would go.

On that day, I picked the restaurant. My nausea is really bad (started at week 3.5, which was how I discovered I was pregnant even before I missed my period), and I found out that the only way of keeping it at bay is to keep eating/drinking the things that calms my stomach down. I definitely gained weight thanks to this. Fortunately, I finally found a low calorie combination that works at keeping my nausea at bay –lemon + loads of ginger juice. Not many places would let me bring in my own gross concoction, but this place does, so I suggested we meet there and explained to Amy why I needed to go there.

As soon as I arrived, I heard Brenda shriek, ""Oh my gawd! Look at YOU! This is SO. BAD!""

I thought she was talking about my weight gain and just proved my husband was a liar –my weight gain was way more obvious than I thought it was. Milk craving + needing to eat more thanks to nausea + stopping intermittent fasting means I've gained about 1.5kg (3.3 lbs) in about 2.5 weeks and I've been freaking out about it. 

&gt;""You look even tinier than before! Aren't you pregnant?? Your stomach looks flat!!!"" Brenda demanded.

&gt;""Yes, but I'm only 6 weeks pregnant. I've actually gained 1.5kg and I'm not supposed to gain weight yet!"" I replied.

&gt;""EXCUSE ME? EXCUSE ME? Who says you're not supposed to gain weight yet?!"" 

&gt;""My doctor and everything I've read on a healthy pregnancy? The embryo's only the size of a blueberry, that's not much.""

&gt;""Have you been reading all the junk on the internet?  Your body is supposed to be developing padding for the baby right now, so it doesn't get injured! Who's your doctor?! Are you sure he knows what he's talking about?!""

&gt;""*She's* a very good gy-""

&gt;""Does she have kids? Because women who don't have kids just don't understand what pregnancy is like!""

&gt;""She's a highly recommended, very experienced gynaecologist who has probably seen thousands of pregnancies in her career, *and* also a mother of two. I think I'm good.""

&gt;""You're NOT supposed to watch your weight while you're pregnant. You're eating for 2 now! Women who watch their weight are selfish, prioritizing their bodies over their babies! Don't be one of them! Your body is supposed to change for good, and that's the sacrifice you have to make for your kids!""

&gt;""I have a family history of diabetes so I think I need to watch my weight to ensure a healthy pregnancy for the sake of my baby."" 

Ok I totally snapped the last statement. Pregnancy has made me a cranky bitch. Amy quickly diffused the situation by changing the topic. 

Unfortunately, mid-conversation, I took a sip of ginger-lemon juice.

&gt;""What is THAT?!"" Brenda bellowed. 

She grabbed my bottle, squinted at it and screamed, ""You're drinking freshly squeezed FRUIT JUICE?!""

Ok, I know a LOT of people freak out over pregnant women eating any raw fruits or vegetables, but I've checked with my gyno and she told me that it's actually ok as long as I can trust the source. I tried explaining that to Brenda, and told her how this cold-pressed juice place is owned by my friend who definitely keeps a cleaner kitchen than mine, and lets me create custom gross juices as a favour. No other place would put the amount of ginger I need to calm my nausea down (40% ginger, 60% lemon juice, no sugar/honey). 

&gt;""I think you really need a new doctor! Do you know how unsafe it is to drink freshly squeezed juice?! I can't believe the crap your doctor is feeding you! If you're craving fruit juices, just get the kinds you find in supermarkets like Florida's Diabetes Supply, or Obesity Punch (*not actual brand names)! Where you know it's safe!"" Brenda lectured.

&gt;""Actually, my friend's brand *can* be found in supermarkets. None of the generic juice brands makes ginger juices and all those juices contain too much added sugar. I need to sip this constantly to stop myself from puking, so I c-""

&gt;""YOUR BABY NEEDS SUGAR TO GROW!"" Brenda yelled this out loud.

People were definitely staring. 

Brenda began lecturing about how sugar is the best to make sure your baby grows and isn't underweight. She gave me all these anecdotal horror stories of women who were told by their doctors that they have to eat more sugar to make sure their baby gains enough weight, or their baby *will die*.

Amy had to quickly change the subject again. Probably because she noticed I'm holding my knife a bit too tightly. Things were peaceful afterwards....until the end of the meal.

&gt;""THAT'S IT?!"" Brenda screamed again.

What now?

&gt;""THAT'S ALL YOU'RE EATING?!"" 

I had an appetizer and a pasta. 

&gt;""YOU'RE NOT EVEN FINISHING YOUR FOOD?!""

I only had maybe 3-4 spoonfuls of pasta leftover. The portions were huge.

&gt;""I'm full."" I told her defensively.

&gt; ""That's totally not enough for a pregnant woman! I thought you're going to order more or get dessert or something! You can't seriously be done!""

&gt; ""I'm *really* full.""

&gt; ""You're eating for TWO! You're a MOM now! You have to be responsible and FORCE YOURSELF TO EAT so the baby has enough to eat! That's what I had to do when **I** had my kids!""

Oh are you pregnant with freakishly gigantic twins now? Because you just ate for 3.

&gt;""Actually,"" I told her with a bit too much snark, because I'm a cranky pregnant lady, ""My gyno already told me that for the rest of my pregnancy, given my size, I'm only supposed to eat an additional 200 calories per day. That's only an additional snack.""

&gt;""Your gyno told you to count calories while you're pregnant?! What is wrong with her?! And 200 calories can't be right! You're eating for TWO!""

Maybe it's the exhaustion, or maybe it's the hormones, but at this moment, I just thought, ""Holy shit, if I played Pregnancy Fat Logic Bingo, I think I've hit all the boxes!"" and that thought got me laughing hysterically. 

Amy and Brenda were totally looking at me like I was crazy but I really can't give any fucks anymore. I just thought the whole situation was just hilarious. We ended the lunch and I kinda felt bad Amy didn't get the nice lunch she was hoping for but oh well, it's not my fault Brenda's a bitch. ",I think I've just won a game of Pregnancy Fat Logic Bingo
fatpeoplestories,"A very lovely Monday^lololol to all you FPS folks! This one may not be as jimmy-rustling as some of my other stories. I just felt it could be shared here.

**Cast:**

Me, Kinvara, 26 F, finally hit my goal weight of 59kg (130 lbs) at 5'6 two weeks ago **YAY**. I weighed 212 lbs at my heaviest in October 2017 and chipped it away gradually with the help of calorie tracking apps, long walks, swimming, and cracking down on sugar consumption.

My friend String Bean, 27 F, approximately 125 lbs at 5'9. Bride to be. Relevant to the story as the incident occurred at her engagement.

HotGuy, guest at the engagement, maybe 175 lbs at 6'0.

Our hamtagonist Dragonfruit, 26 F, around 220 lbs at 5'3. 

Onto the story!

String Bean and I have been friends since we were in seventh grade. She got engaged this Saturday in a fun, colorful ceremony and I couldn't be any happier but for Dragonfruit's behaviour. Dragonfruit is String Bean's neighbour and I have met her many times before. We mostly got along okay, and I actually bonded with her particularly well when I was a fatty myself. However, she'd moved to another city for work and I had not seen her for over a year until Saturday.

All ceremonies related to weddings in India are quite raucous affairs with a lot of people in attendance. This one was no different, with at least 150 guests. Being part of the bridal party, I was with String Bean and several of her female relatives and friends in the dressing room. We were all having a fun time dolling up, oohing and aahing over String Bean, gossiping, the works. 

In walks Dragonfruit, at least 15-20 lbs heavier than when I last saw her, in a bright magenta lehenga with a white-and-black choli (traditional Indian garb) clearly a couple of sizes too small for her. This also explains why I named her Dragonfruit.

Usually people get lehengas stitched to size here rather than buying them readymade, but this one clearly did not fit well. Also the colour she chose did her absolutely no favours as it only highlighted her every roll and bulge. But she looked pretty fabulous overall; she'd always had a great taste in accessories and mad makeup skills. After she and String Bean had finished with all the squealing, hugging and ""you look **GORGEOUS**"" back and forths, I went up to say hi.

""Hiiiiii Dragonfruit! So nice to see you! When did you get here?"" I exclaimed, big grin on my face.

For a while Dragonfruit just stared at me. Then her eyes raked me top to toe. She said nothing for about 10 seconds and I started to feel awkward.

""Kinvara. Hi. You look different"" she said in a clipped voice.

""YEEEES. She lost so much weight this past year. Isn't it amazing?"" String Bean giggled while the hairstylist put finishing touches to her gorgeous bouquet bun. 

""But is that even healthy? You're like half your size last year. Did you get surgery or something?"" Dragonfruit asked.

I sensed several pairs of eyes on me. Yes, a weight loss of over 80 lbs over a year is dramatic. However, it is totally doable with reasonable lifestyle changes. I told her exactly that.

""So no, Dragonfruit. I did not get any surgery done.""

""Hmm"" was all she said. Dragonfruit then proceeded to ignore me for the rest of the time we were in the dressing room. This stung a bit but there were several other people I knew there, so soon enough, I forgot about her.

*About an hour later*

String Bean and her fiance are up on the stage. They've exchanged rings and are now cutting the engagement cake. String Bean looks radiant. Us friends remark upon how lovely she looks, and how her figure is absolutely perfect for her outfit: a gorgeous peach, ivory, and mint ensemble which shows off her toned back and flat stomach.

""String Bean has gotten thinner though, and she was always so skinny. I wonder if it was because Beanstalk asked her to lose weight for the wedding"" Dragonfruit muttered snidely. String Bean's fiance Beanstalk was around 6'3 and 165-170 lbs.

""Would you stop? She looks great. Don't bitch about her on her engagement"" I said, and a couple of others agreed. Dragonfruit just snorted and walked away to join some other people.

Sometime later, us friends had headed over to the buffet and were filling our plates with absolutely delicious looking food. While I was contemplating the choice between Sabziyon ki Tehri and the paneer kolhapuri with butter naan, I heard a deep voice rather close to my face say ""The Tehri is absolutely amazing. You must try it""

I looked up to see this really, really handsome man behind me, smiling shyly. Tehri it was then. I took an extra helping just because of how cute he was.

I headed over to one of the tables nearby where my friends were, and he followed. Turns out, HotGuy was at the table next to us and a friend of the groom's. Soon enough both sets of friends got talking and HotGuy started to chat me up. 

Dragonfruit spotted us. She got up from her chair, came round the table, and parked herself on HotGuy's other side. She started to make conversation, asking him how he knew Beanstalk, what he did for a living, where he stayed etc. No harm done. Once he had answered her questions though, HotGuy turned to me and we started talking about pets, colleges, jobs, and TV shows. Most others were done with lunch while we continued to chat.

All this time Dragonfruit tried hard to interject. At one point HotGuy and I started to discuss Game of Thrones and Dragonfruit kept interrupting with statements that made it obvious she didn't watch the show. Think ""Oh, but Daenerys's dragons are yet to grow up!"" and ""Robb Stark looks so good. I love his character. Can't wait to see him in the next season!""

Anyway. She also wanted third and fourth helpings in this duration, but did not want to leave HotGuy alone. Cue pleading other friends to get her a few extra rotis or a few jalebis ""as you are anyway going to the table""

My friends gave me semi-pointed, semi-teasing looks and I had to tear myself away from the conversation with HotGuy. It was time to leave and as we got up, HotGuy asked me for my number, which I gave him very happily indeed.

I could see Dragonfruit waiting for him to ask for her number as well but he did not, and soon he and his friends left. As my friends and I waited for our Ubers, Dragonfruit was very very quiet. Another friend asked her if she was alright.

She stayed quiet for a while before rounding up on me and delivering this killer:
""So this is why you have been losing weight! So you could be a skank and pick up guys? Hah! I don't need to become a twig like you to do that."" before stepping into an Uber meant for four of us to share and asking the driver to speed off before the others could get even get on.

fatpeoplestories,"(Bear with me, I'm mobile)

Quick brief on background; *for those not in the know* Bumham is my astoundingly fat relative, notable because he manages to keep on weight despite substance abuse issues. I only wish I could hustle money like he hustles food. Anyway...

Last I checked in Ol' Bummy had a little tantrum and got his self properly removed from my place of work. We've since hired a security guard who takes his job seriously so I haven't had any first-hand encounters lately. However, he needs his attention as much as he needs his beetus.

On a rare occasion I'm tasked with security issues, specifically fraud, sometimes fun operations like prostitution stings but that's irrelevant to this story. This particular case was a conflict of interest because it was my Great-Aunt and I was brought on only to verify names and faces of potentially involved relatives.

My Aunt had her purse stolen, she suspects it happened at the store I work at and her card had collected a series of charges. Food charges, a lot of food charges. I instructed my Boss to ask if she keeps her purse in her trunk (like my Grandmother.) She does. I further instruct my Boss to ask if she ever leaves her car unlocked in her driveway. Sometimes, not often. I tell him to ask if her Nephew Bumham has ever witnessed her do either. She pauses then says she'll call us back.

We use this time to review footage and match transaction dates from receipts. The Boss is asking why I suspect Bumham when he can't even shop at our store. I tell him it's something he did to my Gram often and he's more likely to *sell* the card for instant gratification. Then he pauses a recording.

""It's not (Bumham)"" he gloats. 

Obviously it's not. Bumham is not female. Though the woman is someone known to hang out with the same people he does. My Boss can't wait to tell my Aunt his lead and picks up the phone. As he's dialing I scroll back on his footage and stop. 

There it is.

Bumham is handing over the card to this woman in a vehicle. Bossman puts the phone down, ""No way, that's a coincidence"" He says.

We go through all of the recordings so far. Bumham meeting the suspect outside to recieve groceries, sometimes cash. Sometimes just to help her pack all the bags of junk to the growing mob of addicts nearby. 

The phone rings and I answer it to find my Aunt at the other end. 

""(Dumgril)? You'll not believe who I saw on my camera just now""

""(Bumham)"" I answer with amusement.

""Yes, that son of a bitch. Stole my purse right out of my own driveway.""

My Boss interrupts to ask if she's pressing charges, I place the call on speaker just in time to hear -

""Hell yes I am! Get me a number"" She exclaims and we all laugh at her outburst.

He explains which department she needs to report to, reads off a number, and assures her we'll have surveillance and paperwork supporting fraud on our end. 

Looks like Bummy just guaranteed 3 square meals a day for a while.

Her desk is a few feet away and other coworker and I get to listen to loud nose breathing, coughing and the gulping of red bull/monster all day.  Whenever I do a starbucks run for the office, coworker and I will discuss the most calorie-sensible drinks to get, while wheezy ham will order a venti frappucinno WITH whip of course.  She has to take all kinds of meds for multiple condishuns and calls her doctors office all the time to go over upping her dosage because her numbers aren't improving.

fatpeoplestories,"Sadly I do not remember the name of the serie nor the name of the author :/

It’s a roommate story, multiple stories actually, one being a hamplanet and the other one being a girl with an eating disorder (can’t remember which one) 
From what I remember the first part was ho the ham stole some food to the other one, turns out it was her safe food and from there started a roommate war and at some point someone’s mum enters the scene and manage to make things right (???)

Gosh it’s so frustrating, I have full scenes illustrated in my head but I can’t actually describe it :’)

I think it ends by them and the mum going to the restaurant...

It’s weird coz I looked out for it, I hope it’s not  gone forever :/ 

Thanks in advance !

fatpeoplestories,"So to be fair this might be a mild story compared to the ones I see on here but I thought it was funny and wanted to share my little story.

So over the past 7 months I have been working on my personal fitness, I'm 6ft and 200 lbs now. I look pretty lean since I'm a pretty broad guy I don't really have any pug on me but I was up to 245 around last February. I'm getting married in November and it helped motivate me to be the best me I can be.

Main reason for telling you this is my sister is kinda doing the opposite. She has always been on the big side but now she is straight out fat roughly 5' 3"" and a solid 280/300 lbs I would say. She is always talking about losing weight and fad diets and such. She will drop 5 pounds and gain back 10 type of thing.

So last night she is over at my house hanging out with me and she says to me ""it's crazy how you lost all that weight so fast I don't think that's healthy"" 

I respond with ""well I've been working on it for 7 or 8 months, I've been teaching myself solid long term diet and exercise habits, really over that time period I was only losing 4 to 6 lbs a month, pretty easy to maintain and not CL really hard"". 

Realizing she had put herself into a corner she struggles to find any excuse as to why she hasn't lost weight, ""well our family genetics are holding me back""

I look at her shocked and confused ""you're my biological sister, I believe if I can do it so can you.""

She responds ""that's not how it works""

My fiancé has a look on her face of utter disbelief that she said that. We are both fairly used to my sister's thought process on the subject.

Doesn't help that every time she comes over she wants to order pizza and soda and wings and cheese bread, etc. She lives in the country and Noone delivers so she sees it as a big thing when she comes over. ",My fat sister
fatpeoplestories,"My whole family has been overweight my entire life. I was an overweight child and am an overweight adult. I **was** Class II obese when I graduated college, but lost 50 lbs. It is an active fear that I turn out like my parents.

My dad is a type 2 diabetic with heart disease, my mother has blood pressure issues and some mental health issues (not sure if chronic obesity is more of a cause or a symptom.) When my father first got diagnosed with his illnesses, my family did a 180. For quite awhile they were eating better and being more active. My dad lost 75 lbs and avoided heart surgery. My mother was around 400 lbs, and was more overweight than my dad. She had weight loss surgery sometime in late 2015, and lost about 200 lbs over the next year and a half.

But sometime in the last year, the weight started coming back and denial has set in. 

My mother has gained \~90 pounds in the last year. My father has also gained about 50 pounds in the last year. They're literally killing themselves and blaming so many things other than themselves. My mother REFUSES to drink plain water and always sweetens it with mio or crystal light. This is fine once a day or so, but it is EVERY drink she has. Artificial sweeteners trick your pancreas into producing glucose, then when the glucose has nothing to act on it makes you crave carbs. Doing this to your endocrine system ALL THE TIME cannot be good for it. Additionally, they don't really cook, most food in the house is processed, there's never any fruit in the house when I go visit them, they put SEVERAL TABLESPOONS of flavored creamer in their coffee, and order pizza regularly. My mom just sits in her computer chair all day. My dad has a job that requires him to be a bit more active, and goes on walks every now and then because he knows he needs to do better. 

What kills me the most is the effect their behaviors have on my sister. She is 16 and about 40 lbs overweight. She, too, eats mostly junk until she is so full she hurts. She does not drink plain water. Her thyroid levels are the lowest levels of normal possible without being put on medication. I DO realize that a lot of people have thyroid issues that cause obesity, but it is also very possible for chronic obesity to cause thyroid issues, ovarian issues, and all kinds of other health issues aside from diabetes and heart disease. Obese people usually are nutrient deficient, seeing as the processed foods usually consumed by obese people have had their vitamins stripped out. Lack of nutrients paired with constant overworking of your body's systems WILL cause them to not function properly. But they don't see this! They want her to just get on medication and ""it'll work itself out."" Instead of encouraging healthy behaviors in her and modeling them for her, they just call her fat (pot calling the kettle black, since they each weigh about 100 lbs more than her), ridicule her on her eating (again..pot meet kettle), and continue their grocery shopping full of processed junk and routine ordering of pizza.

fatpeoplestories,"Me: struggling binge eater but eats clean 60-70% of the time and manages to stay slim.  Just started high school

Bff: sweet, fun, but makes friends with everyone no matter how annoying they are.  Made friends with hamocrite at hs orientation and is now sitting with him at lunch.

Hamocrite: overweight and faux-edgy

So today we’re not gonna talk about the edgy cringe, I just want to share a bit of hamocrite’s hypocrisy.

- Hamocrite constantly talks about how Americans eat too much sugar (true) but eats probably 500+ cal of sweets daily.  Bff dragged me to Starbucks after orientation with him and he got a sugary drink (forget which one).

- Hamocrite is in my homeroom.  On the first day someone brought in donuts.  Hamocrite said he didn’t understand how people like “just sweet bread” and that they “should just have sweets and bread separately” despite the fact that at orientation he had talked about how he had just made donuts.  Later someone brought donuts in again and Hamocrite said he was so hungry that he had to eat two even though he “doesn’t like them.”

- Hamocrite baked a cake for BFF for her birthday and claimed it was the first cake he had ever baked.  But I went over to his house once and he wanted to bake a cake.  He was very pushy about it and his mom literally had to tell him it was rude to try and force me to bake a cake.  The implication he made at the time was that he was an avid baker and he takes culinary at school.

- Hamocrite buys lunch at school.  He will buy one lunch (usually burger and fries or something equally caloric and unhealthy) and them proclaim that he “doesn’t know why he is still hungry” and get up and buy a second lunch.

Now I found it increasingly annoying to sit at lunch with Hamocrite, which culminated in me no longer sitting with my bff at lunch.  I sit with some other girls who are nice but it is awkward bc they all went to the same middle school and know each other.  I am trying to make friends but I have anxiety and it is stressful.",Hypocrite ham

fatpeoplestories,"(Rant) 
Of every hamplanet I’ve encountered, they have the striking similarity of, while being in my home, eating the shit out of it without permission. This bitch literally says she was going to the toilet, and when I head towards the kitchen because I smelt something, I find her deep-frying my expensive shabu-shabu (pork belly) meat that I had bought, all 3 packets of it just poorly dumped into half a pot of oil. I fucking bought that for a family hotpot gathering for later. 


When I was like “what the fuck are you doing”, this bitch had the balls to smile and say “Oh I was getting a little hungry so I decided to make us all a snack” like this is all fucking normal??? You’re allowed to eat absolutely every fucking thing in other people’s homes as long as you can have access to it???


This seems to happen at work also no matter how much sticker labels and permanent marker is used. I don’t get it how the fuck do you grow up to become so entitled without getting shot or something. 


Im so angry I actually feel sick

Edit:
For clarification - All the pork belly recipes people are giving sound delicious, but shabu shabu is very thinly sliced pork belly meant to be dipped in hot soup for literally 15 seconds or it’ll overcook. ","Seriously, what is it with hamplanets and thinking they are entitled to eat anything other people own?"
fatpeoplestories,"Background: My boyfriend’s mother is a very nosy, pushy, hamplanet who spews fat logic non-stop. 3 out of the 5 family members (the mom, dad, and sister) are over 300lbs. I have no idea how my BF and his brother managed to be very normal people with healthy weights. I have many stories about my experiences with them which I plan to share one day. A lot of it involves his mother hating me for not being obese. It might be helpful to note that I am just a very average size female, lower end of the healthy BMI but again just normal. 

Anyway, my BF graduated a semester early and moved back home to start working while I was still in school, a 4 hour drive away. As I prepare to leave his house, mother-ham starts trying to make me take food, you know, for the LONG trip back. 

I tell her “Oh no really I don’t need to bring anything, I just ate and I have food for me at home”.

Mother-ham “But you’re going to staarrrrve if you don’t bring something to eat”.

Me: “No really, I don’t need this... it’s only a 4 hour drive...and I just ate”.

Mother-ham: “Exactly!! It’s a four hour drive, you NEED to eat, trust me”.

She proceeds to hand me a box of cereal, a few bananas, a box of crackers, and 3 meal-sized portions of the leftover food my BF made for me the night before. 

I stood there in awe that she thinks this is a reasonable amount of food to take for a 4 hour drive. 

She stood in front of me, out of breath from all that shuffling around the kitchen and with a grin on her greasy, swollen face because she feels like she won. She thinks she’s forced me to be like her. 

Me: “Umm thanks?”

As mother-ham waddles out of sight, I put the food back where it belongs and got the fuck out. BF and I had been dating for 5 years at that time and I could tell it always bothered her SO MUCH that I didn’t have the same eating habits as her and her familial hams because she was always justifying her food choices to me even though I never said a word. Ever since BF and I first started dating she has asked questions about what my family eats and would make weird comments if we ever did anything she deemed super athletic like hiking or being able to walk around a city for hours. And she would always buy shitty processed foods for me to keep in her house for when I was over. But under no circumstance was I ever going to eat in excess just to please her. She eventually stopped making and buying me food because I would never eat it. Neither myself nor my BF are ever going to share her fat logic and it is going to drive her crazy.

This time, it went great! Just generally everyone getting along, 'mirin my fancy new patio roof/ fan/ lights/ amazing landscaping/ furniture/ outdoor sound system and let us not forget the sky chair, *ever*, because goddamn do I love that thing. 

We grilled ALL the things, had some drinks, somehow crammed a dozen people in around a coffee table to play Cards Against Humanity, and my house was *not* a disaster area in the morning. Also, people got to take home lots of containers of foodstuffs from the buffet - so my fridge was also not a disaster area. 

I'm reluctant to do this again because, shit, hosting a party for me means two solid days of working my ass off - sterilizing the house because allergic people are coming, also errands and prep work - but damn, it was nice to see everyone.

fatpeoplestories,"My (now former) neckbeard/ham buddy lived with his mother. One day he discovered his mother had placed a tub of mint chocolate ice cream in the freezer, presumably because she wanted to enjoy it later. 

This flummoxed him: as a selfish manchild, didn’t she know that leaving this ice cream in the freezer would cause such temptation for him as to ruin his “diet” (which he never curiously started, though talking about it endlessly)? This outrage cannot stand!

His mental powers of selfishness, neckbeardism, and thoughtlessness combined into the only rational choice: run the perfectly good ice cream down the drain. 

Soon thereafter his mother inquired as to the location of said ice cream. 

“I threw it away. It was tempting me.” No apology, no replacement. He would have never considered anyone else, when it came to food. He was astonished that she got angry at him.

I was driving, on my way to pick my husband off from his work shift. Slowly I catch up with a car in front of me, that is swaying heavily, going fully into the right lane, then quickly pulling back into the middle lane several times.

Worried the person might be drunk or something, I cautiously pass on the left as fast as I can during a seemingly more “stable” moment. 

I glance over, and in the car is a morbidly obese woman, who’s belly is literally pushing the steering wheel, eating with her one hand some kind of breakfast burrito, and holding a giant soda in the other, clearly having trouble eating, balancing her drink and keeping her car straight all at once.

But that wasn’t the end of it. Unfortunately I hit a red light and the woman pulls back up next to me. At green I sped up quickly to avoid getting stuck next to her again, getting an accident due to her swaying - but it wasn’t necessary: right after the crossing, there was a McDonald’s at the corner, and she went straight into the drive-thru as I drove on...",Traffic hazard - Short
fatpeoplestories,"I was in the queue for a coffee at Whole Foods, which is next to the pizza/deli counter. The unmanned pizza counter had some pretty large samples of what looked like maybe sausage rolls, on a tray. (It looked like they took one big sausage roll and cut it into thirds, so each sample was definitely more than enough for a light snack.)

So of course, this rotund woman who was nearly as wide as she was tall (right around 5’ tall), dressed in a muumuu and *barefoot*, waddled up and took a single sample. Popped the whole thing in her mouth and horked it down similar to the way my dog eats a treat: one to two chomps and swallowing it mostly whole. 

Then she peered around, all sneaky-like, to ensure the coast is clear from the sample police, I guess, and proceeded to shove another in her gob, and put two IN HER BOOBS and walked away with the last one in her greasy fat fingers.

fatpeoplestories,"So I worked on the beach at a hotel and my job was to check the guests room number and take people’s orders. Like “how many chairs and umbrellas will you need to be set up?” kind of order. 

I see this regular looking man walking up with his hamplanet wife and I don’t recognize them from the last few days so I assume this is their first day coming down to the beach. They make it to the counter and I do the obligatory greeting and give them the quick run down of how things work when they want to rent beach equipment, get towels, chairs etc. The man was super pleasant the whole time while his whale of a wife stands there, arms crossed, sun glasses on but facing away from me, and huffing and puffing for some unknown reason while I’m talking to the man. 

He tells me they would like 2 chairs and one umbrella and as I start to tell him where to go next, she snaps. The beast literally yells at me “AND DON’T SET US UP NEXT TO ANY THIN PEOPLE”. 

I just stood there, shocked. I smiled at her, thinking that she was joking and maybe didn’t intend to full on yell, but no. She did. She, a too fully grown woman, yelled at me to not put her next to thin people. Rude. 

I explained to her that at that point during the day, the beach was pretty full and the only available spots would be behind everybody but the guys could set up her chairs wherever she tells them.

fatpeoplestories,"Sorry I haven't updated for some time...work got insane but on the positive side, I haven't seen Jen (first story [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/97qp7h/my_body_is_perfect_but_let_me_take_a_diet_pill/)) for nearly 2 months now, so I think I've gotten rid of her for good. This is probably my last story and I'm so thrilled. Anyway, there's so many reasons I don't want to hang out with Jen ever again, but here's the story with the fat logic.

Bit of a background, on my 3rd meeting with Jen, I introduced her to my friend, Ann. In my defense, I didn't know Jen was crazy then. All I knew was that she's larger and into weight lifting, and Ann is a larger girl who's just getting into weight lifting. I thought they'd get along and maybe be gym buddies or something. 

Jen seemed irritated Ann was there, but at that time, I was still giving her the benefit of the doubt and assuming she just had the misfortune of having a resting bitch voice. I thought it was weird she started grilling Ann drill sergeant style about how much she could lift and kept comparing it to how much she lifted. The poor girl just started, relax. 

Still, I've met gigantic, male body builders who asked me how much I could lift and compare it to how much they could lift (I get it bro, you're 20x stronger than me), so I thought it could be a body builder thing. 

During that meeting, I had to go to the bathroom so I left Ann alone with Jen for a long time. I recently developed a mild lactose intolerance, and I still keep forgetting about it, so a long bathroom break was required. By the time I returned, I noticed Ann looked kind of upset and Jen looked annoyed. The rest of the meal was kind of awkward, with Jen seemingly trying to have a one-on-one conversation with me, ignoring Ann. I tried asking Ann what happened when we were alone, but she insisted everything was fine and wouldn't tell me anything. Ann is the sweetest person ever and would never trash someone even if they deserved it.

The next time, I met Jen, I tried to figure out what happened. 

&gt;""Hey,"" I asked her, ""Did you like Ann?""

&gt;""She's ok."" Jen replied in a tone that seemed to include an eye roll.

&gt;""Ann's really the sweetest,"" I replied a tad defensively, ""And since she's into weight lifting and you're into that too, I thought you two would get along.""

&gt;""She doesn't lift."" Jen snapped an instant correction.

&gt;""Huh?""

&gt;""I asked her how much she lifts, she DOESN'T. LIFT."" then, as if realizing she's sounding like a bitch, Jen added, ""Well, but it's good she's exercising.""

Jen then went on to her rant session. By this time, I realized that Jen just needs a therapist, so I stopped introducing her to my friends since I don't want to subject anyone to her rants.

_____

Now back to my last meeting with Jen, when this FPS happened.
 

I happened to mention I was worried about Ann. I suspect she has hypothyroidism, but she doesn't want to get herself checked until her insurance kicks in and she's taking forever to find an insurance provider. 

&gt;""Why do you think she has *hypothyroidism*?"" Jen asked derisively.

&gt;""Well, I first suspected it because she shouldn't be that size for the amount she eats–""

&gt;""How do you know she doesn't secretly eat?!"" Jen demanded, ""People like her usually secretly eat a lot! She's probably secretly eating behind your back!""

I paused for a while to admire the irony. During this meal, Jen happened to order the healthier dish, which she quickly posted on social media. However, she's busy picking on my order –a creamy mushroom risotto. 

&gt;""Ever since I had to help my husband lose 30lbs, I've gotten into the habit of paying close attention to what people eat. So I tend to notice when people eat more or less than they believe they do–""

&gt;""How do you do that?!"" Jen interrupted again, ""They'll just eat behind your back!""

She was still munching on my risotto. 

&gt;""Ann and I hang out a lot, so I already know her eating habits–""

&gt;""You're not with her ALL the time. She's probably eating behind your back!""

&gt;""I usually notice when people munch mindlessly or pack in ""forgettable"" additional calories like ordering sweet drinks, extra sauce, eating the unhealthier sides, or picking on people's food...""

At this point, I couldn't stop myself from glancing down at Jen's fork, busy picking through my risotto. Jen just took a mouthful of really tough calamari, so I finally got my chance to speak without any interruption.

&gt;""...and Ann doesn't do that,"" I continued, ""I agree her diet's not the best, but she should just be 10-15lbs overweight at the most, not 20-30lbs, so I suspect the rest could be a thyroid issue. She checked with her mom and turns out her family has a history of thyroid cancer and she's always had a weak immune system, so I really think she should get her thyroid checked.""

Jen seemed mollified after I mentioned that Ann's diet wasn't the best, but she still had to have the final say after she swallowed the rubbery calamari, ""She could still just be pigging out big time behind your back.""

Jen finished 2/3rds of my risotto, the entire plate of rubbery calamari that I refused to touch after I spat my bite out (and was planning to send back to the kitchen before Jen went ham on it), as well as her skirt steak salad. Of course, she only posted the salad on her social media.

This was also the meeting where I found out she's busy sexting married men, so I'm so done with her.

fatpeoplestories,"I used to be the general manager of a tabletop game and hobby store. We were in a town right by a very large Army base, so most of our customers were clean-cut, married soldiers.

The other half of my customer base, the ones who played trading card games, were the absolute worst. Neckbeards to end all neckbeards, and every time I thought I'd seen it all, they surprised me again. I had to ban lewd body pillows after a couple of them brought their ""girlfriends"" to the store. My one female employee was always seconds away from a rampage with the Friday Night Magic crowd. Had to pull her out of working Fridays to prevent the inevitable physical violence.

Our worst, or at least the worst that comes to mind at the moment, was Dean (name changed for privacy). He checked most of the boxes, obese, horrible diet, fedora on the head, messy eater, and a grade-A asshole. Dean had a penchant for lewd diaper furry playmats (think a giant mousepad to set your cards on during a game) and definitely didn't have a penchant for bathing. You smelled him before you saw him. He smelled far worse than even the average trading card game player, and was at least in his late twenties.

One evening, he was exceptionally ripe. Smelled like the dumpster outside a daycare, and other card players started complaining. I had a rule that if you smelled like you hadn't bathed, I'd call out your name loudly and kick you out, telling everyone that you smelled like ass. This angered the Dean. He threw a screaming fit, ranting about how I was so horrible, that I'd lost a customer forever, that people just came to see him play, and finished with ""I can't help how I smell, I can't help that I'm too big to wipe!""

You could have heard a pin drop after he said that. We were all just too horrified to speak, and when my brain recovered from that stunning revelation all I could say was ""get out or I'm calling the cops"". He grabbed his things and stormed out and the shop was a little quieter than usual for the rest of the night.

fatpeoplestories,"So here's another tale of CW (coworker), I'm not too sure if this is a fat people story so if it doesn't fit then I'll happily take it down.

&amp;#x200B;

You need a bit of background on this one: The place we worked at (blood donation organisation) would sometimes have mock emergencies where they would simulate some kind of emergency or disaster and sit back and observe our reaction and how we handled it. These weren't just drills like setting off the fire alarm and us all shuffling out of the building, bored out of our skulls and just waiting to be allowed back in so we could get back to real work. Management would get an outside company in that specialised in this kind of thing and they went all out. There would be smoke, noise, debris all over, confusion and shouting. Some staff and blood donors would be picked out and given fake wounds with special effects makeup,fake blood, bones poking out of limbs, the works. We would have to react as if it was a real emergency, give first aid, get the injured people out and evacuate the building while being watched to see if we screwed up.

&amp;#x200B;

One day one of these mock emergencies happened at our branch. CW and some other staff from smaller branches were present so they could also be observed because it would be very costly to do this kind of thing at each branch. CW flatly refused to use the stairs and took the lift instead (we got marked down for that) and she spotted an 'injured' donor with a broken femur. What does she do? She walks right past him to the door and comes back in with another donor. Not another staff member who is qualified to offer first aid, a random blood donor. She grabs another donor and directs her to put a short splint that stretched from his hip to his knee on the leg and wrap some gauze bandage around the whole mess. She also got the donor to wipe some fake blood off the laceration on his head and slap a piece of gauze on it. All of this happened because she was too fat to bend down or get on the ground to treat him herself (remember she is a qualified nurse) so she used a random donor as a kind of lackey. She then told the donor he could get his arse up off the floor and walk out, he was fine now that he had that piddly little splint on (just for perspective, our SOP would have been to keep him immobilised, put a full-leg splint on, get him onto a stretcher and carry him out). Our branch nearly got a failing score because of her, our branch manager managed to pull a miracle out of her hat because CW was not a regular staff member there so we passed by the skin of our teeth. We also found out that she raided the office fridge after we were allowed back inside and scarfed down half a cake and some biscuits because she was feeling faint after all the activity.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm not saying she would behave like this in a real emergency and expose other people to possibly infectious blood or walk out on an injured person because she's too fat to offer them effective first aid but I am saying i wouldn't want to be injured and have only her to rely on for help.","The Mock Emergency (Go ahead and walk out, you're fine now)"
fatpeoplestories,"Greetings shitlords! Dobokdude reporting from Sextor 7198, Division A. My shift is now over here at Dominos. And for the most part it was actually pretty good. Not too many orders, were all done in a timely matter, I even got a 2 dollar tip. But this is a pizza place that tailor makes beetus discs to the most asinine design, so of course the following happened.



I was manning the register hoping for some good tips. Then a fat white guy walks in with a kid. Typical dad bod, well actually he was a bit fatter than that. I say ""welcome to Domino's"" and get his name. Now he ordered two pizzas seperately for whatever reason. So I bring him the first one while the other is in the oven and there's a problem:  apparently he wanted this pizza(a regular medium) to be cut square. Now usual procedure would be to cut the pizza in squares only if its *thin* crust, because thin crusts pizza doesn't.have raised crust edges. In fact when his second pizza came out it was square cut, but as a result had small slices, some of which was just crust. 



Now here's where shit goes downhill. Have you ever messed up something in your life, and someone pointed out the flaws by asking rhetorical questions? Well that's what the fat snob did, because basically he starts doing that in regards to how one pizza is cut and how the other had pepperoni on it by mistake. And the whole time he is talking with a tone that might sound polite but really dripped with passive aggressive rudeness and condescension.



Being professional I apologized for the error and asked him if he would like a remake of the pizzas. Now most normal customers would simply accept the remake, acceot a compensation discount or just cancel the order for a refund. I shit you not, everytime I offered an option, he would then asks ""so how can we make that work"" and such with a tone and expression that seemed to demand I give him my undivided attention. And here's what seals the deal. With the same smug ass smile on his face, he says something along these lines:


""You know I actually don't care about how the pizzas cut or what's on it. If you ever heard of (insert random rock band) or celebrities in general they often have their assistants bring them green M and M's. They don't care about the M and M's actually. They just want to make sure everyone is doing their job right. That's why I ordered the extra stuff.""


...Are you fucking kidding me?! You are seriously telling me that I'm spending almost 5 minutes dealing with your picky entitled ass over an error made to your order, and you don't even give a shit? You just wanted to feel like some goddamn celebrity who can have others waiting on them hand and foot? I mean, seriously, with his little speech and not giving a straight answer of what to do, I had to get one of the more experienced employees to deal with him, and of course he repeated the same shit to her, but the irony was that in the time both me and my coworker had to deal with him, he could've had both pizzas remade since he was bitching about how long it would take(which actually wasnt true since like I said it was a slow day.)


After he finally left, I helped my coworker make more dough, and she explained that he had created small talk as well saying some shit about how she should be manager. I wonder if he was flirting with her, but regardless even she said his voice was full of low key rudeness. Seriously, it's understandable to want an error to something you paid for to be fixed, but you don't sit there and be an entitled ass by bitching about shit you don't have an issue with, since there's other things to do in the establishment. So snobbish Domino's fat fucker: let's not meet, ever again.",Tales from a Dominos Shitlord: The Fat-Snob Menace
fatpeoplestories,"The city that I live in has a lot of homeless people, and they like to catcall/compliment a lot of girls that walk around. On this particular day, I had spent a bit of extra time dressing up due to an interview, so I had my heels on, was wearing decent makeup, and a skirt. I finally finished (it went well!) and I was on my way home when a homeless guy calls me over and starts to compliment me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was on my phone so I wasn't too aware of my surroundings, but it almost felt as if this ham was waiting for a chance to come out of hiding. She was about 300 lbs and wearing a bright blue tube dress. As I turn up my head to smile at the homeless man out of politeness, she thunders over and starts yelling at the guy, ""Do you only think skinny bitches are attractive?"" The homeless guy tries to explain himself but the ham just cuts in at every moment with phrases like, ""That is very offensive"" or ""You shouldn't only catcall skinny bitches"" and ""I was standing here this whole time, and you didn't cat call me once. What do you think that says?"" In the end, the homeless man yells that he is just not attracted to her, regardless of how fat anyone is. After trying to get more words out, she gives up and retreats. She didn't really move away so she's most likely waiting for him to catcall another ""skinny bitch"" to prove her point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Typically, I feel that most girls would not want to get catcalled especially on shady streets during evening time, but I guess the homeless population needs to remember to be inclusive with their catcalling.

fatpeoplestories,"Short time lurker, first time poster. 

Yesterday I decided to get lunch at a local Nando's. I don't live in America, so for those of you who don't know, it's a restaurant that primarily serves peri-peri chicken, and I think there are some branches in the US. Here goes...

I place my regular order of chicken wings with chips and corn on the cob. The restaurant wasn't particularly busy when I first came in, but more customers enter as I sit at my table, waiting for my order. My food arrives and I start eating, hoping that the place won't get too crowded.

I'm sitting there in peace when the doors across the room slowly swing open and a ham of cosmological mass enters the region of space which constitutes the restaurant. The celestial body in question (RefillHam) is about 5'3 or 5'4 and seems to be around 300lbs. Oh dear. It's not long before I look up and have the despairing realisation that RefillHam is slowly plodding towards a table not too far away from me.

Now, this particular restaurant has a type of seating (name?) where there is one very long padded seat along the wall, and there are tables placed along it. [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/D4KuSPP) a picture I found on the internet that shows the kind of thing I mean. 

It's clear that RefillHam is not going to fit into the relatively tiny gap between the seat and the table, so the unfortunate waiter is tasked with the job of dragging the chair and table several feet back to create a space RefillHam can more easily enter and exit. The hamplanet quite literally *collides* with the seat. I hope I can go back to eating in peace.

Another thing to note is that this Nando's is one of those restaurants with bottomless/unlimited soft drinks, so you just pay once and then get given a glass, which you can refill as many times as you want at the drinks machine. You usually get the glass a while before your food arrives.

A short while passes and then I look up to see that the same waiter who moved the table for RefillHam is standing at her table holding an empty glass.

I can hear RefillHam raising her voice.

""GO and get a Fanta for me right now""

I can't quite hear what the waiter says, but he seems to comply and hurriedly rushes over to the drinks machine, which is only about 15 feet away, and fills up the glass for her before returning.

RefillHam literally snatches the glass from his hand, spilling a small amount on the table. Much to my disbelief, she DOWNS the drink at an unbelievable rate. Somehow miraculously, she makes it through the whole glass without choking on the liquid. 

A minute or so later, the same waiter walks past her table.

""This glass is FAR too small, you have to give me a bigger glass""

This time I hear the waiter say something along the lines of this:

""I'm sorry madam, we don't have any larger glasses in this restaurant, but you can refill a bottomless drink as many times as you like so you're perfectly welcome to go and fill up the glass more than once."" 

Keep in mind the drinks machine is only 15 feet away from RefillHam's table.

""You want ME to walk all the way to the drinks machine? You want ME to keep getting up and down all the time? Isn't it your job to fill up drinks for customers?""

""I'm sorry, but it's company policy for customers to fill their own drinks-""

""Fill it up myself? But my doctor says I have medical condishuns! I have to keep my sugahs topped up or I could just collapse and die right here!""

""The drinks machine is just over there-""

RefillHam slams the glass down on the table and shifts around in her seat for a few seconds before finally lifting her colossal weight up, and stumbles furtively but slowly in the direction of the drinks machine. Believe it or not, she fills her glass and just stands there at the machine, blocking off access for other people, drinking as quickly as she can before refilling her glass *immediately* and repeating the process a couple of times before finally waddling back towards her table, full-to-brim drink clutched in hand.",RefillHam And The Drinks Machine
fatpeoplestories,"My hamplanet neighbour (HN) - Around my height (154cm, and est 90kg) - has been trying to get me to break my diet (keto, no sugar and milk in drinks, lots of water).


I’ve been meal prepping chicken breast, cabbage and carrot soups, and sticking with it for about a week now. I’ve dropped a kg and been feeling just amazing with exercising 2km a day. My legs look a bit less flabby and I wore a skirt for the first time in maybe 3 years. 


Cue HN - Her husband jokingly commented that dieting was a good idea when we were all in the lift one day and she went off her rails about how dieting showed I have an ugly heart and society standards all that blah blah 


Since then, shes been buying absolute fucking junk (chocolate / chips / ice creams etc) and just passing it to me. By passing I mean hanging it outside my doorstep. I’ve told her I don’t want it and her excuses were that “Oh we just bought too much / you should eat it you need it to start a family your hips are too small to give birth to healthy children they’re bones will be too small / just throw it away if you don’t want it.” 


For those who know me, you know that I absolutely hate wasting food. I grew up from a shitpoor family and we were taught that no matter what food came on our plate, to shut up and finish it. HN has heard about this too (from the neighbourhood) I guess and she knows I won’t ever fucking throw food away. Its kind of what led me to my state (75kg) in the first place, finishing everything off my plate. 


So I put everything in my cupboard, and was planning to bring them to school after the weekend was over to pass to my friends.


On friday night, I got into a huge fight with my bf over his alcoholism and I just finished everything. All the junk food. Every single thing. 


I feel fat and bloated and tired and sad. And most of all ugly. I’m angry at HN but I don’t blame her. I blame myself. It feels like such a setback and I’m going to get back on track but I just need to rant for now.


I have so many stories of HN lol but never been really motivated to write them so this is my first post. ",I’m so fucking angry at myself

fatpeoplestories,"  

Once upon a time I was a surgery resident at a trauma center in an inner city. It was before the “80 hour work week” rule went into effect so I was putting in 120 hour weeks on average. I have a lot of great stories from this time involving being physically assaulted in the trauma bay etc. Today I want to tell an  uplifting story of how a hefty fellow resident solved a mystery and made us all very happy.

For the first couple years of the residency I made slightly under $25,000 a year. Things were really tight because I had to live in the city on that budget. There wasn’t good public transportation so I also had to pay for a beat-up car, parking and gas. It was a lot of hard work but I was helped by the fact that every time I was on call in the hospital, I got a $5 food voucher for the hospital cafeteria. It wouldn’t buy much but every little bit helps when you are on a tight budget. I really appreciated that food voucher. 

At the start of year three, the hospital decided to take away the food vouchers and all hell broke loose. On of the senior residents would just walk into the cafeteria, take what he wanted, and walk out. I’m not keen on getting fired so I never resorted to that tactic. Instead I would pack a bologna sandwich, an apple, a diet coke and some sort of snack to eat over the 36-40 hours I would be in the hospital when I was on call.

Around that time, the hospital started carrying Krispy Kreme donuts in the cafeteria. Needless to say, we were all HUGE fans of Krispy Kremes. Who isn’t? Sadly, I couldn’t afford to buy the tasty treats. They were like a buck fifty a piece and that can really add up. 

One night I was on call with a junior resident and we hatched a plan to find out where the Krispy Kremes were being delivered and hijack a few before they got to the cafeteria as revenge for them working us like rented mules and taking away our measly $5 food voucher.

We scoped out the delivery dock. It was connected to one of the maintenance areas of the hospital. After a few nights on call we nailed down the time that the donuts showed up at the dock. It came like clockwork at 4:15 AM. Then one of the maintenance staff would come out, grab the cart, and hustle it inside. We figured all we would have to do was find a way to get into the maintenance area and we could jack the donuts from there when no one was looking. 

A few nights later I was walking down one of the halls on the top floor and there was a maintenance cart there. It was a pushcart with a tool chest, a plunger, a bucket, a mop, various odds and ends and a crappy CD player. That night the CD player was quietly playing some sort of slow jam. I wish I knew what song it was because in the middle of the song the music stopped and a horse whinnied and then the song started again. I thought it was clever. Written in Sharpie on the side of the cart was “grownt flor.’ Hanging by a string from the handle was a single key. ‘Eureka,’ I thought to myself. I looked around, and seeing nobody, I snatched the key. I was hoping it would be the key to the ground floor maintenance area by the loading dock. Just then a level 1 trauma came in and occupied the rest of the night so I wouldn’t get to try the key for a few more nights.

During a slow time, a few nights later, I sent the intern to try the key in the door. After several minutes he came back with a huge smile on his face. We were in luck! We knew where the donuts were being delivered and we had a key to the place. We watched with trembling anticipation as the Krispy Kreme truck pulled up to the loading dock. After the treasure was hauled inside we waited 10 minutes or so to try the door. 

I opened the door just a crack at first. If the maintenance man looked over and saw me my plan was to say that I found the door open and was trying to find him because there was a clogged toilet up on the psych ward. I looked around and no one was in the room. Also missing from the room was the Krispy Kreme cart! This was puzzling because as far as we knew there was only one other exit from the room and we had never seen the cart come out of that door. We also had a spy watching the door and she reported no traffic.

We checked several more times at night but the same thing always happened. The truck would show up at the dock, the treats would be whisked inside, and then would disappear until they showed up in the cafeteria a few hours later.

The mystery was the subject of much debate in the surgery resident’s lounge (the swamp) over the next few weeks. At the start of the next month a new intern rotated onto my service. He is the hero of our story and we’ll call him Beef. He was about 5’4” tall, Indian (dot, not feather) and slightly balding. He was good natured and happy and we all liked him. His wife would sometimes send a delicious curry with him when he was on call, and it was my pleasure to sample that curry many times while it was waiting for him in the swamp refrigerator. Ha! Her samosas were incredible, by the way. 

Beef was a small moon. If I had to guess I would say he weighed about 275 pounds. He was hefty but certainly not in planet territory. We were on call a few nights later and it was somewhat quiet when the Krispy Kreme truck pulled up. I reasoned we had time to see if Beef could find the donuts.

Like clockwork the truck came and dropped off the donuts. We snuck into the maintenance room and as expected there were no donuts. I was about to leave when Beef held his hand up and said ‘Vait! I smell donuts!’ This guy was like some sort of a donut bloodhound. He sniffed a few times and headed over to a big stack of cardboard boxes. The boxes held supplies of cleaning items and other various goods. For some reason we had always ignored the pile. Who would have thought that the maintenance guy would go to the trouble of hiding the donuts behind a huge pile of boxes?

‘They’re in there,’ Beef said, pointing towards the stack. After searching we found that the boxes on the side of the stack, next to the wall were empty. We moved the boxes out of the way and it revealed 2 astonishing things. First, there was a literal man cave hidden in a hollowed-out area in the stack. There was a TV, couch, ashtray, pinup posters, a lava lamp and a mini-fridge! Second, set into the wall was an elevator we had never spotted before! It was one of those freight elevators with the wire mesh door, not meant to carry public passengers. We opened the door and as we did the delicious smell of Krispy Kremes wafted over us. 

Rather than just pilfer the donuts right then and there, we decided to see where the elevator went. It went up 5 floors and down to the basement. I decided to ride the elevator up to the 5th floor. It opened into a small room where janitorial supplies were kept. That would explain why we never knew about the secret elevator. We pilfered a few donuts and sent the elevator back to the first floor.

No one was the wiser for a long time. Every night, the on-call surgery residents would wait for the delivery, go up to the fifth floor and call up a tasty delivery. We were careful not to take too many so that they would not be missed. After a month, Beef rotated off my service and needless to say he got a glowing review.

Months went by and Beef rotated onto a few other surgical services, radiology, family medicine etc. Soon, every resident in the hospital knew how to access the secret elevator and call up treats. Eventually the hospital had a falling out with Krispy Kreme over the light deliveries and they stopped carrying the donuts. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted and many thanks are owed to Beef and his wonderful nose.  
   
 ",The Great Krispy Kreme Caper!
fatpeoplestories,"I was at a craft fair the other weekend, my friend makes beautiful crochet items, even though she is mostly blind, it's actually pretty amazing that she knows what the stitches feel like, but never really gets to appreciate how the finished project looks, but people buy that stuff up fast, so I helped her at her booth, made sure nobody tried to take advantage of her and such as well.

Anyway there's a lot of hams walking around, but mostly we see them carrying huge portions of food and walking over to the seating area but I'm still keeping an eye out because a fat lady with her face all squished up like a pugs had at one point snortled her way into our booth and began to pick up my friends items to look at with her fingers sticky with what looked like some sort of bbq sauce and I was like hell no, keep your chubby mitts off that!

Anyway a hambeast walks into our booth, the tables in our booth are set up in a U shape there are 3 on each side and a carpeted area in the middle, but it's not a huge area to move around in, I think we once had 3 normal sized women in there are one point, each looking at items on the items on different tables and even they were a bit crowded.

The first thing this ham does is start touching everything, but her hands don't seem unclean and she's not rooting through it to say disrupt pules of crochet blankets so I just sit back and watch.  We have a small stack of sweaters my friend had started on making so there were maybe only 6 there at the time, 2 each in a small, medium and large sizes.  The ham grunts a little and says something rude about not having her size.

Like hello those sweaters take a long time to make and this woman looked like she may have needed a 4x, and you know how clothing stores sometimes charge a few dollars more for the plus sized item, because it uses more cloth?  Well the ham starts asking my friend how much it would cost to make something in a bigger size, and my friend turns to ask me what size I think this lady is.  Well I knew this was going to get awkward fast, my friend can't see the lady well enough and here I am thinking that if I say the truth that it's gonna upset the ham and if I lie the ham might actually order a sweater for a later time and then get mad when it doesn't fit.

Anyway after I pause a few seconds the ham chips in that she only needs an extra large, I cough a little and lean to whisper to my friend that she may mean that it should be extra large, times 4.  Well the ham hears this and waddles closer to the table and makes this creepy grin at us and says.

""I just have an extra large personality that skinny bitches like you can't handle""

Then she turned to leave our booth.  On the way out she is shuffling her feet a bit and out of her shorts falls at first what I think is a piece of paper, I tell her she dropped something but she keeps on walking.  I get up to walk around the table, just to pick it up so her trash isn't cluttering our booth area.

Guys......when I got around and bent down to pick it up, I also threw up!  It was basically a bloody piece of toilet paper.  Like I get that you are a girl and sometimes in public you get your period that day and you don't have any pads or tampons with you, so you improvise with some toilet paper before you get home.  But I'm almost certain she knew that thing fell out and seemed to not even care.  I literally had to get some paper towels and grab the thing and throw it out myself.  

The funny part of it was that I told my friend what the ham had left in our booth, and then we went on about the craft fair activities without too much more thought about it.  Apparently the ham was walking by talking to someone, and I didn't notice because that place got crowded after a while, but my friend while she cannot see very well. can pick voices out of a crowd really well.  So as the ham is passing by, my blunt, amazing, friend says out loud.

""Next time could you please dispose of your makeshift female sanitary products before leaving our booth?""

The ham looked visibly upset, marched over to our booth and said that was not her toilet paper that fell on the floor, it must have gotten stuck on her shoe when she was in the bathroom.

""I never said it was made of toilet paper, but since I know it was yours, maybe you should go home early and take care of that little problem.""

My friend never did care too much what other people thought.  :)",not safe after eating lunch....craft fair ham!

Anyway most of my clients are hard working awesome people who give it a 100 percent and they are seeing awesome results however.. I have a new client who, lets just say she may drive me to day drink.

Sara is 430 to 450 pounds I don’t know her exact weight because our scale doesn’t go past 400 and depending on the day you ask her it always changes. She is 27 and five foot three so I’m guesstimating she will have to get to 115-130 to get to 25% body fat. Normally we send our clients for a before dexi scan so we know where they are at body fat wise but the weight limit is 350 for the dexi scan. 

We normally have our clients document what they eat in a 48 hour period. Sara consumes 5,000 calories a day. When I told her I consume 1,800 a day as maintenance she cried,  she actually sobbed and told me she’d starve if she only ate that amount (spoiler alert: she wouldn’t) 

I then asked her what her favorite cardio exercise was... and she replied eating cause doesn’t that like burn calories isn’t it cardio?

It's just a one story complex with a standard sized parking lot. I do feel bad for the guy because it gets hot and I imagine delivering mail in the heat is never fun. However, he was very upset with our office today because we haven't been around to get the door to get the mail these past few days. We are handling a big project in the warehouse in the back and we are unable to get the front door in this situation. They know to bring the mail to the back if they want, but otherwise they just try again the next day. It's never really been an issue. Today he was covered in sweat and he kept repeating that we weren't there to get the door for the mail last time. I explained to him that we were in the back and that he knew to meet us back there to deliver the mail otherwise we wouldn't be upset if we had to wait the next day. He just continued looking upset and when I got the mail, it wreaked of Mcdonalds. Now I'm sorting through the mail and gagging in the process.",Upset Mailman
fatpeoplestories,"My mom has a friend, who is definitely of the species hamious-among-us, so thought I would share something I remember from the last time she came to visit us, because a new visit is being planned and it might remind me to write some more about her.

So last Christmas this friend, let's call her Martha, because that's her name and she wouldn't know how to use a computer, much less reddit, so yeah, Martha.  She lives across the country, but she travels here a few times a year to visit family and friends from her childhood, my mom being one of those friends.  Martha isn't HUGE, I mean she is pretty big, but I've become desensitized to this because I've also seen some real massive beasts in my time and can't really estimate weight all that well.  BUT I do know she must weight over 300 because that's all the more our bathroom scale measures and she once stepped on it and laughed about how she weighed so little, (with a definite teehee thrown in for special effect, can you hear it?) but the exact number escapes me at this time.

When Martha arrives at our house she always makes my dad or older brother go out and carry in all her luggage.  Now Martha's parents live nearby, but she never stays with them and I'm not 100% on why this is, except that we know them, they go to our church and are a fairly nice, normal older couple, who just happened to somehow raise a rude entitled hambeast.  I'm sure the dysfunctionality is somehow covered up by sugary sweet ""bless her little hearts"" and ""praise jesus at least she isn't on drugs"", but that's an entirely different subject matter for another time.

So Martha always enters our house and will snap her fingers for my dad or brother to go bring in all her luggage, and it's always this neon pink set, that seems packed to the brim with god knows what, since she claims to never have any money so my parents pay for her to be entertained the whole 2 weeks she normally stays.

While the luggage is being brought to the guest room Martha moves like a slug with a limp, she drags her feet on the floor and then with a sort of a ""slorp, grunt, nose snorting"" kind of wheeze she lifts each leg, ""thump, heave, repeat wheeze, thump, heave, repeat wheeze""  and then she slumps down onto our couch with a groan, and the couch silently cries in pain because it recognizes that it will be traumatized for the duration of Martha's visit.

Martha snaps her fingers again, and my little sister, who is quite sick and pretty disabled, has to give up the remote and stop watching her favorite shows so that Martha can turn on some porn, I mean the cooking channel, but it may as well be porn for the way she drools and moans over the items that appear on the screen.

So, I know you don't really know much about my family, sorry but long character intros are just silly to me, and I don't feel like wriitng one out but let me just give you the tiniest one.  We're all fairly normal sized people, not thin or fat or even really very active, we don't eat the healthiest but we don't gorge ourselves either.  I live with my mom, my dad, my older brother who is in college and my younger sister, who is extremely disabled and among all of her other complicated health conditions, was just recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.

 Family has been really supportive, we all help take care of my sister, please don't feel sorry for her, she is 10 and just the sweetest and happiest kid I know, very spoiled with love and has even coped fairly well with the fact that sweets whenever she wants one, are really not an option anymore.  One of the ways that a family member had tried to be supportive is that when they sent us the yearly gift basket that they do, kind of a tradition during the holidays, lots of little candies and specialty meats and cheeses and such, they also sent a huge box of sugar free chocolates for my sister, so she wouldn't be left out.  (I know you know where this is going, I'm not insulting your intelligence, just be patient....teehee, sorry Martha is getting impatient too!)

Anyway, we all knew that eating too much, or in some of our cases, any of that chocolate, caused the familiar laxative effect, so we'd all began to either avoid it completely or eat just one piece every few days and that was alright.  My sister was enjoying that she had a treat that was hers, and one piece was usually fine for her, she's always struggled with eating enough so it was no big deal, so that after a week or so of this box of candy being in our house, (I think it was a pound box), there was 3/4 or more of it left.

So anyway as Martha is drooling over her food porn on the tv, she also snaps her fingers at my mother and asks what snacks we have.  My mom will usually bring out something for her and so that's what she did, and Martha gorged herself on my mom's delicious cookies, candy and other holiday treats until dinner time.

The rest of the evening was spent with Martha hogging the tv, the rest of us move to play some board games at the dining room table, and Martha after having eaten her before dinner snack, and then 2 helpings of dinner, ate yet more candy and other snacks in front of the tv afterward, luckily my mom is always well prepared for one of Martha's visits, though I know it's not doing her any favors enabling her, that's just one of those things in life it's not my job to fix.

So it gets late, I help my sister get into bed, and help with her medications and other things that need to be done, my parents could do it but sometimes she requests I come in and we have a sleepover type night and just laugh and jokes and listen to music, I think it's easier for her to feel like a normal kid when it's just me and her and not my parents fretting over her so much.

Anyway we can still hear the drone of the tv, even as we are starting to settle down for bed hours later.  It keeps me awake a little as I'm used to it being quieter, but I fall asleep.  Around 3am I hear a loud crash from the living room, I listen a moment, can still hear the tv and roll over and go back to sleep, assuming it was the cat, or Martha dropped something, it's 3am not really conscious about anything at that moment.

The next morning I'm woken up by some kind of commotion in the bathroom across the hall.  When I've woken up enough to understand what has happened, it turns out Martha had clogged her own toilet that is joined to the guest room and then clogged the toilet in the hall that me and my sister and brother all share.

Now, why is this such revenge?

Well in the middle of the night Martha must have run out of sugary treats to feed her ""low shugahs"" and has eaten what was nearly a pound of my sister's sugar free chocolate in one sitting.  Nobody really had any sympathy and my mom actually looks like she might laugh, if it weren't for the fact that she had to clean up the majority of the mess.  

The house smelled so bad for hours.  Just full of farts and shit.  literal shit.  Martha denied eating the chocolate, despite the fact that we pointed out how the box had been nearly full before bed.  It was no big deal, I mean it was a gift and no one had really been enjoying it so much that we'd even care if it got replaced, in fact my sister who had eaten the most out of any of us, (Martha excluded of course), still to this day wonders how anyone could eat that much of it, because she said it's not disgusting, but still not something you want to keep putting in your mouth over and over.


Martha spend the rest of the visit asking every time if a treat was sugar free or not, which made it easy for me to hoard away some of my favorite snacks by writing sugar free on it, just doing as Martha requested so she doesn't get sick again.....teehee!

I'm sure more shenanigans happened, but that was the thing that stuck out in my memory.  And since she is coming back in a few weeks for a friend's wedding, i'm sure something else will get written about.","Revenge, of the not so sweet variety"

&gt;Dont be: Hamanager  5'5"" is twice as wide as me

Now my local BK is a shithole and I'm surprised they haven't closed the doors. They're always looking for help, and they fuck most of their orders up.

So one day I decide to try that American King with the Budweiser cheese sauce or whatever it is. The sandwich itself was pretty okay, what it took to get it was not.

I pull into the drivethru and order. 

&gt;american king, no tomato... large Dr. Pepper, small fry

Yes I know I'm one of those difficult people but I hate restaurant tomatoes, they're always slimy... and I hate bk fries.

Pull up, pay, check my order.  It's wrong... I got the standard whopper with large fries, but the correct drink.

So I pull into the parking, and go in for the inevitable idiocy that is about to follow.

&gt;me: yes hi, I got the wrong order

&gt;cashier: let me grab a manager

&gt;Hamaneger: let's see the receipt. No no you got the right sandwich...

&gt;me: no, I did not... i ordered the American and I got a regular... and I wanted a small fry.

This goes back and forth for a bit, and finally I get them to remake the sandwich... no new fry tho...

&gt;me: I wanted a small fry aswell

&gt;Ham: well you get free upgrade then

&gt;me:but they're cold now, I want new

Cue manager wheezing over to the fries and fishing me a large.

&gt;me: that's not what I ordered...

&gt;ham: why do you skinny fucks make everything difficult? You men are the problem.

The wild tumblrina got triggered.

I just shut up at that point because I don't make classic blunders. Like starting a land war in Asia or arguing with a mentally unstable person.

I grab the large fry, tuck it in the new sandwich bag, pull out the correct sandwich and check for tomatoes... 

It had tomatoes...

&gt;me: I said no tomato...

&gt;Ham: just pick them off!

&gt;me: okay... *pick then off and throw them behind the counter on the floor*

fatpeoplestories,"So I am not at a healthy weight yet, but I've lost 44 pounds so far this year and have another 50-70 to go so it's a work in progress and all that jazz.

​

So my roommate and I are out today and need to eat but can't head home yet which is an hour drive away from town so it's just easier to eat something quick.  Now my roommate, she has a lot of fatlogic, but is still attempting to support the life style changes I have made, even though she has expressed the opinion that she is not yet at the place in her life to make similar changes yet.

​

I have been trying the keto diet, and clearly it's working out for me, and my favorite fast food place so far is Carl's Jr, I like that that they don't make a huge deal out of asking for a lettuce wrap instead of a bun, (usually....see exception for today apparently).

​

We hadn't been to this location before though and we had to pee, so we decided to go inside since we find asking for special orders sometimes goes easier at the counter where you can bring it back when it's wrong more quickly, and since my roommate has a ton of food allergies that's just the easiest way to do it.

​

However today the lady at the register is so large and round that I am really not entirely sure how she was standing upright, to be fair, she was kind of leaning on the counter, so maybe that's how she didn't just roll under it.  We've not been to this location yet and never seen this woman before.  So we walk up to place our orders, my roommate's completely plain with no condiments or veggies, just meat, cheese and a bun, and mine with no bun but everything else intact.  The woman grunts, charges us, gives the order to the back, whatever it is she is doing, stops to scratch her ass and then as she is handing us the water cups she starts in on us.

​

""You know.....""  She says in a sneering whisper.  ""All carbs are not bad.  And you are ruining your figure because you won't have a cute plump baby face and nice tits and ass after you lose all the weight you are wasting your time trying to lose, you'll just look old and saggy.""  I just ignored her, because I wanted to go chug some water and her breath smelled real bad too.

So our food comes up and she's put it in a to go bag, even though we asked for it here, no matter we carry it to a table so we can make sure it's alright.  Well my roommate's is fine, plain burger, I open mine up and on first glance it's alright as well, lettuce wrapped it is.  However when I go to pick it up it slides right down to the floor, because someone has slathered so much ketchup and mayo on it that it has nothing holding it to all that soggy lettuce.  So while I'm cleaning it up my roommate grabs some napkins from the bag and notices that there is a smaller bag in there, with a note attached.  The bag contains the bun that normally goes on my burger and the note reads:

​

""Just in case you see some sense, your burger will taste better with this yummy bun!""   And some hearts and smiley faces were added to it.

​

Now this was actually starting to bother me.  What she said earlier really bothered me too because it's been one of my worst fears.  I've never really felt super unattractive, I know I'm fat but I used to think it was in a cute way because I carried it well, wore clothes that fit etc.  And I am legitimately afraid that after I lose the weight that I will just look like a loser with loose skin.  But the other thing that started me wanting to cry is that, I didn't get this far from ""condishuns"" or ""genetiks"" I KNOW I am addicted to sugar and carbs.  I used to go to the grocery store bakery section, buy a box of a dozen doughnuts from their case and eat it all in one day.  I have sometimes binged on over 10,000 calories in a day before, so I KNOW how important it is to keep my distance from things that might tempt me.  And eating out at a fast food place was still a learning experience for me, sitting there with my roommate eating her burger with a bun was still hard, but she never does it in a flaunting way so I've learned to ignore it and enjoy my burger.  For the first time in my life, I know what it's like to feel happily satisfied and not overly full.  And so it really bugged me that she slipped that bun in there because I can recognize how easy it would have been to just shove that useless bunch of carbs into my mouth.

​

So we went back up to get my burger fixed.  And this ham delivers another burger up, in a bag, this time it's got the bun on and the girl says I can just take the bun off but at least the sandwich is exactly as it would have been, because she doesn't think the girl back there does the lettuce wraps very well.  Well I might have been ok with this, but my roommate was not and asked to speak to her manager.  So the manager comes out, and she isn't standing, she's got some kind of bariatric walker on wheels and she is sitting her rotund ass on it and using her short stubby tree trunk legs to push herself up to the counter.

​

""Can I help you?""  She grumbles out, at least that is honestly what I hoped she said.

​

We explain the situation and she grunts and says some bullshit about how carbs are not bad, but that they had a crowd earlier come through who all wanted lettuce wraps and it was something like 10 people wanting them and they were just a little cranky and overworked.

​

In the end I did get my burger, but I didn't eat it.  I was a little afraid somebody might've spit on it.  We've called their corporate office and complained and while they have offered us several vouchers in free meals, we'll not be going back to that specific location, even though the person we spoke to on the phone said they were fairly certain those 2 women would not be working there much longer.  So I'll just have a free burger some other time when people aren't trying to tell me how to live my life.",A ham tried to force me to eat carbs
fatpeoplestories,"So, I've been ranting on another sub about a coworker's fatlogic, but the latest incident that happened doesn't fit there, but would certainly be at home here--especially since another player has joined the battle.

Cast:

Possibly be me: 5'5"" 110lbs. Vegetarian due to health reasons and moderately active, also for health reasons. Kind of sarcastic, dry humour, but never rude about it. (Unless you're being a dick.)

Don't be: Co-worker A, codename: Ginger. 5'2"" 180lbs. Wants to lose weight and follows my advice, but continually eats double the portions or just eats straight up garbage. 

Also don't be: Co-worker B, codename: Becky. (Not because she's a ""stereotypical white girl"", but she legit looks identical to Becky from Empire.) 5'8""ish possibly 300-400lbs.

So, let's start with Ginger. I've known her for a couple of years now, but lately, she's become more dependent on me, so it feels more like I suddenly have an adult child instead of a coworker. Well anyway, I've lost a bit of weight partially on purpose and partially due to medication side effects encouraging me to clean up my eating. (Granted, I've never been over 135lbs in my life, but the way I carry my weight, anything over 125lbs is uncomfortable and I look slightly pregnant after eating.) 

Anyway, sometimes she joins me on my walks and she likes to relentlessly vent, but if she sees someone she doesn't approve of, she'll abruptly stop and switch the conversation.

Ginger: Oh my God, that lady stays eating. I never wanna be that fat. *says as she veers off the walk course to go into the store and buy some snacks.*

Another time--

Ginger: *old disabled lady walks by with noticeably disfigured legs, hunch, and a cane.* did you hear what she said? (I said I heard nothing, because honestly, I'd been tuning out Ginger's bitching through most of the walk.) She gave me one of those slowly once overs and said HMPH (and something else I have tuned out, allegedly something snide about how she was dressed). Jealous. I swear, people are always so jealous. 

Yeah, I'm pretty that didn't happen. She didn't even look at Ginger. She was just muttering to herself the whole way down the hall.

Now, onto Becky. I love Becky, but about a year ago, I started wearing dresses to work instead of my oversized shirts and leggings and to one particular skater dress, this was her comment.

Becky: Oh! I love the stripper chic!

Okay, rude...I didn't say anything, but it upset me and I didn't wear that dress again for a year  until I was sure I wouldn't run into her again.

...fast forward to last week. I'm wearing some coloured contacts, oversized pull over and a pair of black jeggings.

Becky: Ohh, you're giving me escort vibes! Kinky~

I--what? I asked my mother if I was overreacting by being upset at her comments (I've always had self esteem/body issues) and she said no and that she thinks Becky is jealous. I wouldn't ordinarily jump to that conclusion, but all of the other women in the building (40-60+) have complimented me on my outfits, saying that they look very nice, so now I feel like maybe she's right or she doesn't mean it in a derogatory way, because in her defense, I do own a pair of ""stripper boots"" that have never set foot in the office and my style is very ""gothic""/alternative, but toned down for a professional setting.

fatpeoplestories,"Hey hey guys, I have a.. a rant, I guess? It's not particularly funny, but it is a very longgoing fat people story. It's about my family, but most notably, my mother.

&amp;#x200B;

She's in her 40s we live in the south where food is culture and food is given out all the time for emotion comfort and I grew up VERY large--almost 300 at my biggest (I'm a woman) and didn't know jack shit about nutrition or calorie defects and she was very happy to let me go on a fast track to where she is now. She's over 400 lbs and won't share the real number. She's had many surgeries and health scares including the biggest hernia her doctor had ever seen, asthma, diabetes, extreme nerve pain, etc etc. She has a prescription BASKET of meds she takes daily for various symptoms, all of which would improve if she took her weight seriously. 

  
Her health is deteriorating rapidly. We used to decorate the whole house for different holidays and last year we didn't even put up a Christmas tree. She's too tired. She's always too tired. Too tired to shop, too tired to cook, too tired to do laundry. I cook every meal and clean the entire house now by myself- it's part of my rent, but it's also something that wouldn't get done if I wasn't there. I work too, but I'm not too tired to function. My dad's kind of an enabler, encouraging her to eat 'whatever she wants' when we go out, but I can tell he's mad when all the food goes missing so quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

She buys a LOT of fatty food, along with other snacks, and eats them in a couple of days, because it's 'keto'. I do keto and I eat only very small amounts of those things. She doesn't avoid bread or fried food, either. She doesn't try at all. She claims she cannot lose weight because of PCOS. Well, I have PCOS-- something she refused to get me medicated for even though she takes meds for it-- and I've gone to 180 pounds relatively easily (and my periods came back!). I had to learn about nutrition from research, because I was miserable and she wanted me to be there with her. She accuses me of having an eating disorder all the time, or gets mad because I'm 'not eating enough' when I measure my portions. But I feel better than ever. Eating 3000 calories in 'snacks' in an evening won't help me. I tell her she's eating too much of them and I want to eat a little too, and she laughs about it. Gluttony is so funny and cute.

&amp;#x200B;

There's so much to say here about ignorance and manipulation and her slowly being unable to do ANYTHING at all but sit and ask for more foo, but I don't want to make this too long. I love her. I miss who she used to be. I miss decorating the house and eating some of the stuff she used to make (best apple pie ever). I wish she'd take it seriously. I'm trying to mourn her already, which is.. dark, but I know this can't last too much longer. How could it? I was afraid the anesthesia for the hernia surgery would kill her. She's got so many symptoms and keeps eating so much, I'm terrified to lose my mother before I'm thirty years old. That thought doesn't seem to cross her mind and it kills me. She misses her mother who died of lung cancer SO much, yet seems to want to leave methe same way.. and even sooner. It feels too late at this point, you know? It feels like she'll never change.

fatpeoplestories,"i want to make a quick post about a small incident that happened last week during a lockdown drill at my school. long story short, i'm in my culinary class and this ham (let's call her tina) who is roughly 5'7, maybe 300 pounds and is most likely no older than 17 since we're both high school juniors. a lockdown drill was announced over the intercom and we had to basically make ourselves hidden in the event of a school shooting or something of the like. my culinary classroom is basically open area with a wall of windows so our best bet was to either scramble to the pantries or duck behind the cupboards near the ovens. i chose the latter since my table was closer to the cupboards and if the lockdown wasn't a drill, it would've been quicker and more efficient. cue tina. she also sits at my table (love similar last names) and she follows me to the cupboards and basically presses her body up against mine. i was basically smashed between flab and wood for around 15 minutes and tina spends this time practically wailing about how uncomfortable sitting on the floor is. due to me not being a total dickwad, i decide to say nothing and remain silent which was the goal anyway considering the drill situation. tina was the only person who kept making loud noises which really defeated the goal of the exercise: how to survive a school shooting. don't even get me started on the fact that we have to practice this but it could've gone far better if i hadn't felt like i resembled a piece of paper after the fact. this just seems like rambling but i decided to share this, missed you fps",lockdown drill ham
fatpeoplestories,"Last night I found myself craving a donut. It’s a rare occasion, but I decided to walk down to the store and pick out one from the bakery section. 

My local store’s bakery section has a cabinet on one wall with all the individual pastries lined up on shelves. It’s fairly large, 4 feet tall by 8 feet wide, sitting on a cabinet containing boxes, bags and gloves for self-service. 

I walk toward the cabinet, passing a Bakery Ham in the area (5’2”, F, ~400lbs). BH sees where I am headed and with a swiftness I’ve only seen in cheetahs in documentaries makes a dash toward the donuts, passing me. 

BH then proceeds to block the pastry case with her cart on one side, her body in the middle, and the open glass cabinet door on the other. She had formed an impenetrable fortress around the front of the pastries, blocking access to me or anyone else. 

BH then assembled boxes of FOUR DOZEN DONUTS. Since it was the end of the day there weren’t many pastries left, but she was kind enough to leave behind a tray of plain cake donuts and bran muffins for me. Giving me a smug look, she places the stack of donuts into her cart.

fatpeoplestories,"I was just a spectator, so not much detail, but I thought you guys might enjoy something I saw the other weekend.

My city is really awful for food past ten pm. My neighborhood has one Carl’s Jr. that is open 24 hours (drive thru only) and it’s terrible. They take forever, fuck up your order and once I pulled over because I dropped my wallet under my seat and an employee came out to deliver my food / get my money and tried to fondle me and steal my cellphone.

But hunger and/or alcohol overrides common sense sometimes.

So yeah, one night I got fairly drunk and was sleeping on my friend’s couch by the bar. My friend is a bachelor and basically had cream of wheat and instant coffee in their house. I was hangry af.

Since he was sober and just watching forensic files, I asked him if he’d take me to CJ and in return, I’d buy him some food. Friend obliged.

So we get there and there’s like 6 people in the drive thru ahead of us. This is worse than usual, but we have limited options.

10 or 15 minutes pass and we’re able to order and just chilling and waiting for food. There’s probably 3 cars ahead. 

All of a sudden we hear a car horn blare and look behind us. The (clearly obese) woman in the next car is losing her shit. She’s beating her fists on the steering wheel, screaming and possibly crying.

The line isn’t moving. We feel awkward staring at her, but it’s kind of hard not to. This continues for another 5 minutes or so.

Then we hear a crash.

Big Carla (lol I referenced the CJ menu) had thrown her car in reverse because I guess her sugars were low and she decided to try the McDonald’s a few miles away. Unfortunately, there was someone behind her.

Not to be deterred, Big Carla attempted to drive over a median and onto the adjoining street. Not once addressing that she’d torn off someone’s bumper.

Well, she ended up tearing off her own bumper and disabling her car in some fashion. She was driving an early 2000’s Honda and they’re super low to the ground.

So she’s stuck there. Horn blaring. Can’t tell if she’s sobbing or cursing. The person she hit gets out, cell phone in hand, obviously calling the cops. The line can’t move because the ass end of her car is halfway in the drive thru lane.

5 minutes later we got our food. The cops hadn’t come yet and we love drama, so we sat there, ate our disgusting meal in the parking lot and waited.

Big Carla refused to get out of her car and had to be removed. 4 officers (2 cars) showed up, and it took all of them to extract her. She appeared to be at least 350 lbs and maybe 5’6.

I was drunk and tired and my friend didn’t want to have to give a statement, so we hightailed it out of there. Didn’t feel bad because there was at least 3 witnesses, cameras and obvious evidence of what went down.

If she was drunk, she’s in for a felony.

fatpeoplestories,"Hey all, I hope you're having an amazing Friday!!! Throughout the past few weeks, roughly 12ish weeks, I have managed to lose around 25 pounds; I started from 230 and now I'm around 204. I'm feeling pretty good about myself, and will start training at my universities gym when I get there in a week. So yeah. It's been one hell of a summer but a great one!. If you're wondering how I did it, here's a little breakdown of it all. 

I work with dogs and a large portion of it is quick movements when cleaning their suites, and a lot of the motions to clean it stem from a rowing motion. Likewise on the weekend, I move the crates and clean behind them. I also started tracking calories along with cutting gatorade/ power aid/ beer ( my biggest weaknesses) out of a daily diet. Now I have them on a ""cheat day"" whenever I go out with my buds. ",Weight update
fatpeoplestories,"Longtime lurker here, I just have to create a throwaway to rant about a new ""friend"" I met, whom I'll call Jen. This is kinda long since I have a 6 meetings worth of frustrations to get off my chest, I'll add additional details in footnotes in the comments to try and shorten the story as much as I can. 

I met Jen through a person whose friendship I'm *seriously* reconsidering. My friend told me his friend Jen just moved into the city, is having a tough time job hunting and had to move back in with her mom. Apparently, she's miserable and he asked me if he could introduce me to her so she could have a girl friend for ""girl talk"". Her home is close to my office so it'll be easy for us to meet up. No problem! I could always make a new friend!

I was so naïve. Turns out, he was dumping her on me. At the first meeting, she seemed fine, so I gave her my number and agreed to hang out with her.

Judging by the frequency Jen messages &amp; calls me, I think she has no other friend, and for good reason. 

As I got to know her, her attitude just gets crazier and crazier. She rants to me nonstop and I feel like I should get paid for being her therapist. I really felt bad for her and wanted to help at first, so I kept hanging out with her, but.....

...she also gets more and more rude to wait staff. I feel so fucking uncomfortable being on the same table as her. I make sure I'm extra nice and tip extra well to make up for her attitude, but I still feel bad.^1 

Now, Jen is large. Apparently she's into body building, but she's not one of those lean, cut sort of body builders. If I'm being brutally honest, Jen looks...well...fat. 

She claims she's fitter than ""98% of people out there"" and since I'm not a body builder and know nothing about body building, I'll just accept it at face value. I've seen larger looking body builders so I guess that's a thing.

Anyway, Jen's mom disagrees with that assessment and  thinks Jen's just fat, so she keeps threatening to reduce her allowance unless she loses weight. Since Jen is jobless, she relies on her mother for money so this was an issue for her. Privately, I think no one is entitled to free cash from their parents once they've graduated college (debt free since her parents paid everything). 

The shitty thing is, Jen has received several job offers, but the catch is that the pay is *the average college grad pay.* Jen believes she's smarter than most people and therefore require a salary that's in the top 2% of entry level salaries. She's a law school grad^2, see. So she's been turning them down and living off her mom instead.

I'm high enough in the corporate ladder to make hiring decisions in my company, so I tried gently letting her know that she may have to lower her expectations. I told her the salary she's asking is closer to the average salary of someone with 3-4 years of work experience. She exploded on me, yelling, ""My expectations aren't even that high! I just want a job that pays me properly and I'm not like other girls who don't work and just expect to sleep their way to the top! I actually work!""^3

Jen hates her mom, and to be fair, her mom does seem kinda crazy, but if I were in her shoes, I'd take the first job I could get so I would no longer be dependent on handouts from a crazy person. 

Anyway, here's the FPS part.

So, Jen loves talking about how hot her body is and would bring it up at every opportunity. It was kind of weird since we're talking in real life and not on Discord. I can see what she looks like. I'm all for self-love but she's gone way into straight up narcism.

The annoying part is, even though she loves bashing ""beauty standards"" and insists how bullshit they are, she has to trash everyone's bodies, including mine. 

Ok, I don't go to the gym. I know it's bad, but my job is demanding and by the time I have free time, I just want to read a book, cuddle with my husband and relax. I rely annual health check up to tell me how I'm doing, and so far, I'm doing good (BMI 21, Total Cholesterol = 122 mg/dL, Blood Pressure = 106/60) just because I make up for my lack of activity with eating very healthy. But I know that no matter how healthy I eat, at 30, my body will not look as toned as it did when I was in my teens and working out. 

Jen *loves* making fun of my arms. It's apparently 1/3 the size of hers and really flabby. Yeah, I admit, my arms are weak as fuck and I don't mind people making fun of it, but bringing it up nonstop every meeting gets old. 

Every woman seem to have a ""shit body"" and be in ""shit shape"" according to Jen. She warned me not to trust my health test results since ""BMI is a lie"". Her BMI is at 32, which would make her obese, but she insisted it's all muscle. I totally get that, one of my friends back in highschool was a professional athlete, and she was obese BMI-wise even though she looked good. *However*, I do think Jen should probably go for a health check up just to make sure she's really ""all muscle"" as she claims she is, because....

Jen eats a LOT. 

She always claims it's because she needs protein to bulk up, and that's why she'd eat 2-3 main courses at every meal. That's totally her prerogative so I don't care. As she got comfortable with me though, her true eating habits showed. It first started with her finishing up my food. Whenever I eat, I leave the bread/potatoes/fries/onion rings alone since well...I don't go to the gym. I can't afford empty calories. Jen would finish them up. She'd order healthier meals and instagram/facebook them, of course.

By our 4th meeting, as she got comfortable with me, her orders got crazier and unhealthier....but she'd instagram/facebook the healthier meals I ordered and pass them off as hers. She knows I don't have social media, but she likes ""accidentally"" leaving her IG page open on her phone at every opportunity that I can see what she posts. Her IG says she's a ""body builder &amp; fitness guru"".  

When I first met her, I wondered how she looked the way she does despite claiming to spend 2-3h/day at the gym, but now I understood. You can't outrun your fork. It seems like her goal is just to pack on pounds, whether they're muscle or fat.

Anyway, during my last meeting^4 with Jen, she told me her mom got her diet pills. They were some sketchy pills that just comes in an unlabelled tub.

""Holy crap, your mom is *really* crazy,"" I told her, completely horrified, ""You're throwing them away right?""

Jen popped one in her mouth. ""I have no choice! She's making me take them!""

""But...your mom isn't here...."" I pointed out after looking around just in case there's some crazy woman in a trench coat hiding behind a potted plant or something, ""You can just throw them away and tell her you took them...?""

""I HAVE TO OK!"" Jen yelled at me, and launched into a tirade about how she checked the ingredients, they're safe and it's so much easier on her life to go with what her mom wants, and how she has no choice at all. 

I was so confused. Did her mom have a spy drone following her around or something? If she really didn't want to take them, how hard is it to not take them when her mom isn't around?

Then she rambled on about feminism, how fucked up beauty standards are, how smart she is, how hot she is, how many men are in love with her, her shitty job situation, her mom being crazy....

I was totally lost, but just did my usual nodding and making sympathetic noises before chugging a latte and letting lactose intolerance kick in so I could cut the meeting short.

I'm starting to suspect Jen's claims about how confident she is in her body is a lie. I think she secretly wants to be thin, but she rather go with the ""easy"" solution and take sketchy diet pills rather than cut back on what she's eating. 
","My body is perfect, but let me take a diet pill!"
fatpeoplestories,"I work for a great company.  I love my job, my bosses and my lifestyle.  My bosses are also the owners of the company and very fitness minded.

My bosses do something fun for the office all the time.  However, every quarter they do something big such as season tickets to theme parks, outings, you get the idea.

Last year our bosses told us they were considering getting season passes to a water park.  Everybody was super excited.  To kick off the season they even discussed having party at the water park (on a Saturday).  Our bosses were offering to buy season tickets for up to two adults and all children under 18 living at home for each employee.  It was very generous and everyone knew it.    Cue Thing 1 and Thing 2.  Both are planet sized easily 350 (?) pounds each.  Immediately the complaining begins.  The litany of ‘concerns’ went on for days.  The first complaint was that the park had a lot of lines and there would be too much walking.  Second there were a limited number of places to eat and it was expensive.  Third our bosses were not including premium parking for the season meaning they would have to walk from the parking lot to the park.  Fourth not everyone could ride the rides.  There were others but I really don’t remember them.  In their infinite wisdom Thing 1 and Thing 2 created a list of obstacles for, and I could not make this up, ‘family members of size’.  They also came up with a proposal for resolving these issues.  The proposal circulated around the office and like 99% of the people in the office I ignored it.  I don’t think anyone thought they would actually give it to our bosses.  Well, they did.  They went back to the bosses with a list of concerns and their thoughts on the best resolution.  Now this happened without any input from other employees that we know of.  Thing 1 and Thing 2 passed it off as though the ‘office team’ asked them to address this.  We never call ourselves the ‘office team’.  Now this was clearly a play to get the speed pass, premium parking and the all you can eat daily option at the restaurant.  So...here comes the email from Boss 1.  Boss 1 asked if the whole office had these concerns.  Cue the reply all’s and long walks into Boss 1’s office.  With the exception of Thing 1 and Thing 2 everyone denied having any involvement.  And of course apologies flowed from every staff member.  Except Thing 1 and Thing 2.

My team of three does not report to the office manager but we respect her and aren’t above following her instructions.  Office manager loses her sh*t and goes on a rampage.  Now office manager is maybe 5ft tall and very muscular her husband is bodybuilder or something and she clearly works out with him.  Office manager calls Thing 1 and Thing 2 into her office and lights them up like firecrackers on the Fourth of July.  The whole office hears the tirade.  Thing 2 tried to speak once but was shut down.  After that Office manager told them to take a 30 minute break and think about what they did.  Instead of taking a walk, Thing 1 &amp; 2 waddle over to the doughnut shop and order those large 1,000 calorie coffee drinks (you know the ones) and some food.  On a 30 minute break.  At 1:30 in the afternoon. Right after lunch.  Let that sink in.  They also bought a half dozen doughnuts to bring to the office to apologize.   How do I know?  My office window faces the doughnut shop.  6 doughnuts for the 11 people who were in that day.

Cue email two from Boss 1&amp;2.  It was a very gracious email explaining that since not everyone would be able to fully enjoy the water park, they would plan another event and let us know in a few days.

Thing 1&amp; 2 drop the doughnuts on the break room table with an apology note while one of my guys was sitting there.  Old boy let’s them have it very loudly.  Flat out tells them that they ruined something that he and his family were very much looking forward to because ‘you two can’t stop stuffing your fat gobs long enough to understand that you are creating your own problems’.  Things 1 &amp; 2 said nothing, however, they filed a complaint with HR the next day.  Because I am team lead I was told about the complaint, not the content, and that no action was being taken and it would not be filed (maybe an HR person can explain what that means).

So I took the only revenge I could.  My team’s work area is in the back of the building next to the parking lot.  You have to pass through my area to get to the main office if you come through the back.  It’s the office shortcut.  Everybody walks through the back to get to the office.  Otherwise you have to walk around the entire building to get to the main entrance.  I told office manager and HR that my team member needed some space from Things 1 &amp; 2 and I would like to them to stay out of my area for 30 days so as not to inflame the situation.  Apparently Bosses 1 &amp; 2 and HR felt like 60 days would be better.  So for the next two months Thing 1 &amp; 2 waddled around the building every time they had to go to their cars.  Which for them was four times a day.  Arriving at work, leaving for lunch, returning from lunch and leaving for the day.  Not the revenge I would have liked but at least it was something.

Side note:  There is a group that always eats out together everyday.  All of them large.  All of them complain of money problems and sore legs.  All of them drive to the fast food place or the pizza place to eat.  Both of these places are less than 1/4 mile from our office a very easy walk for anyone except for them apparently.",Two Fatties Sabotage Water Park Tickets For Whole Company
fatpeoplestories,"Hello my sweet landbased mermaids/mermen, I would like to apologize for my previous post that was very devoid of ham shenanigans. I have been going through a lot of bad things within a very short time, so I terribly neglected you all and your dire beetus needs. I am so very sorry, and hope to redeem myself with the following tale. 

After my ex broke up with me, I was resigned to going back to my overseas-living-mom’s house that had tenants in it but I still had a room there in case of emergency/someone getting fed up with my shit and giving me the boot. I have a good relationship with the tenants, as did my ex, so it was quite the walk of shame for me to return tail between my legs, sans ex, with 4 cats in tow, and a very bleak outlook on my continued existence. 

My mother decided in the midst of my mental breakdown post breakup, that she would cancel the landscaping service and it would be good for me to do it to keep my mind off my impending doom! I mean she had a point, but it was early summer and I hate heat/sun/outside. 

In any case, once I started mowing the lawn and doing all sorts of lawn care things, I became obsessed with having the greenest of the green perfectly manicured lawns. People walking by would be like “omg your lawn is the best in the neighborhood!!” I was like fucking right, bow to me you plebs. 

In addition to a mildly concerning attachment to grass, I have a soft spot for the elderly. By soft spot, I mean I will cry any time I see them because they’re old and it’s sad and I have emotional issues. 

My neighbors are elderly and adorable, so I have been mowing and putting a decent amount of care of their lawn for no charge (except to see them being cute and in love after 50 years then to go cry in bed). I mow, bag the refuse, and will do some occasional edging if necessary. I don’t water or fertilize, because MY LAWN IS THE BEST so I don’t want any competition. 

People have seen me out and about, and have asked if I’ll do whatever for their lawn. I’ve declined since I do have a full time job, and this was really only out of my elderly loving heart. 

One guy though was my directly across the street neighbor, he is likely in his late 60s/early 70s, and was a walking haunch of Certified Angus BeefHam. I had seen him pushing it to the limit mowing his lawn; the majority of the houses on my street have a lawn that slopes downward at a substantial angle. It hurt my tender heart, so one super hot and humid day I went over to see if he was okay. 

Across the Street Ham (ASH) barely acknowledged my Good Samaritan concerns, and brusquely asked me if I would be willing to mow his lawn because he was having trouble. I explained my working situation, but attempted to helpfully suggest that he mow his lawn side to side, instead of top to bottom. WELL HOW FUCKING DARE I?

I was blissfully unaware that some people aka probably only ASH actually care about the lines the lawnmower makes on their lawn, so by suggesting he make those lines horizontal instead of vertical, his reaction indicated I had taken an urn of his grandmother’s ashes and proceeded to use it as a urine receptacle. His gut that had about 7 beer guts on top of it quivered with indignation, and I half expected his lowest (of 3) chins to grow a mouth and continue shrieking at me. 

As most of you no doubt know, I used to work in EMS (Emergency Medical Servants) and I could see a coronary coming from a mile away. I caved to the pressure of potentially watching someone up and DIE in front of me, so agreed to mow his lawn once a week, top to bottom. 

First time I try to begin, ASH is out there saying the height of my mower is too high. It’s set to cut at a decent height that makes the lawn look good and keep it healthy while not being so low that it will kill the grass - study your lawn science, peeps. 

ASH makes me crank my mower’s rusted height adjusters to the lowest possible setting. It’s not an easy thing to do, as they haven’t moved in years. He chuckles at my struggle and sarcastically says “need some help?” I hop up and say “sure!!!” all cheery and happy like - beep boop must imitate human emotion. His substantially chubby cheeks purple, and he walks into the backyard mumbling something about leaving the grill on. Ookay. 

I finally finish adjusting and he returns from doing whatever the hell, and I inform him that the height setting he demanded will make his yard look like a golf course in the middle of a drought, but he seems satisfied with that dour prediction. Given the green light, I begin working, and ASH retreats to a lounge chair on his front porch that’s under an umbrella, folds his arms over his beach ball of a stomach, glares at me through half lidded eyes like a sunbathing lizard, and the fun begins. 

Fast forward to me finishing, and to literally no one’s surprise except ASH, his lawn looks 75% dead. After I finish bagging the grass cuttings, I go up to where he’s standing on the front step, jowls a-quiverin. 

“This is unacceptable. I asked you to mow my lawn and make it look pristine.” Well no, you asked me to mow your lawn and then insisted I reduce the height settings to the lowest level, despite me cautioning the potential outcome. My desire to say I fucking TOLD YOU was so strong I almost burst a blood vessel in my forehead. Also my lawn is the only pristine one allowed, back it up. 

“I never said that, you liar. I’m going to sue you unless you replace my lawn.”

So now I’ve gone from generous lawnmower to sod replacer, it was insanely hot and I was exhausted from repeatedly pushing my mower up a steep incline, so I simply said “no.” He can sue me all he wants, I have enough money for gas, cat food, and ramen. Go wild. 

As I said, I mowed his lawn to prevent him having a stroke in front of me. That was a leaf in the wind compared to what I experienced next. 

ASH got in my face, well really my collarbone region since he was pretty short, and by doing so belly bounced me off the front step and down onto my ass (I was exhausted and my legs already were about to collapse underneath me. ‘Twas a hot day). Before I could do anything besides register the ridiculousness of what just transpired to land me on my badonk, he was crouched over me screaming millennial-tailored insults into my astonished face. His lower, hairy, peeking out from under his shirt stomach was touching my knees. *Hiss*

One proclamation that I specifically recall was “I paid your unemployed ass to mow my lawn and you RUINED IT!” 1. Am employed, excuse yourself 2. I DID THIS FOR FREE because I’m NICE. 

But that little bit of nonsense is what made me stop being nice, which was hard. I really, fucking *really* try to always be nice. You never know what someone is going through, but this guy clearly was going through hamstruation and that was not on my agenda of things to deal with in 90 degree weather. 

I stand up, brush. that. dirtoffmyshoulder. and prepare to bestow upon him the fear of God. I loom over him, put my face in his, and start slowly leaning forward at the waist without sacrificing any of the solid foot of height I had on him. He tries to escape my Look of Doom by retracting his face into his neck, but unfortunately for him he is not a turtle, and ended up having so many neck rolls he could’ve been a body double for Jabba the Hut. 

I walk backwards down his driveway rolling my mower beside me, trying not to acquaint my ass with the ground again, keeping my Doom-Glare firmly planted on his globular head, and watched with satisfaction as his face proper slowly emerged from the depths of Tartarus to resume its jowly form. 

A week or so later, I’m staring out my front bay window early awaiting my food delivery and thoroughly creeping out everyone passing by, when I see ASH out mowing his lawn. Horizontally, and not leaving death in its wake. He wasn’t wearing a shirt though, so death may come afterwards due to mental strain. 

I consider the lesson he learned and my unappreciated labor my sacrifice to the Grass Gods, and I expect a lush green lawn requiring minimal effort to maintain as compensation. Hasn’t happened yet, but good things take time.

fatpeoplestories,"This might not be the appropriate place to post this; if so, sincere apologies.

I'm 29, 5'5"", 227lbs at last weigh-in. According to a hastily-found BMI calculator, mine sits at about 38. I developed toxic eating habits as a child. Won't get into the reasons why; not here looking for pity, to shift blame or to make excuses. I was also diagnosed with hypothyroidism when I was 15. Not blaming that for the fatness, though it has made it a bit difficult (not impossible, mind you) to shed the weight since those eating habits changed. For most of my adolescence I was uncomfortably close to 300lbs. In my early adulthood the school of hard knocks got me to switch out one set of toxic eating habits for another; I went from constantly having food in my facehole to straight up not eating 2 or 3 days out of the week; on those days I ran on coffee. Upside, I lost a smidge over 80lbs in about 8 months. Downside, I did it in a really unhealthy way. But whatevs, I went from 278lbs to 194lbs so I'd rather focus on the positive. It took some work and therapy to get to a point where my eating habits were reasonably healthy; calorie consumption somewhere in the neighborhood of 1800-2000 per day, working in a physically demanding job so getting decent exercise. Life was good. At one point I was down to 174lbs and feeling prouder than I've ever been.  


I had a wall-o'-text explaining a bunch of stuff that went down which contributed to my weight doing its best yo-yo impression but realized that it was sounding a whole lot like ""woe is me"" so lets just leave it at over the past 7-ish years a bunch of shitty stuff happened. The source of my current weight woes was a rather grievous error on the part of my Doctor involving a medication I shouldn't have been prescribed that interacted poorly with the synthetic thyroid hormone I have to take to keep said organ functioning properly. Because of the medication error I went back up to nearly 250lbs, the heaviest I've been in years. The error is now being corrected. With calorie management and 4-8 hours of moderate exercise per week I've gotten down to the weight I mentioned in the second paragraph. 

Between the thyroid issue and the fact that I don't want to end up looking like a flying squirrel, I don't ever expect to weigh less than 160lbs. But if I could get close to that I'd be happy. I've got a wee problem though, and that's where advice from some of you would be helpful. Right now I'm capable of working out 4 days a week for 1-2 hours on those days, pushing myself as hard as my body will currently allow. Years of morbid obesity did a number on my joints so pain levels get a bit unbearable if I do more than that, though I don't know if the pain would lessen or at least become more bearable as time goes on and I establish a workout routine. The thing I really struggle with is managing calories without going off the rails. 

When I work out I get ravenously hungry. While I do have the discipline to stick to a 2000 calorie limit and make those calories count with good food choices, I find that after a few weeks the hunger gets harder and harder to ignore and as a result I start having some pretty intense mood issues. I end up getting extremely cranky and depressed. I don't know whether this is because of a physical thing or if it's purely psychological. And sooner or later I end up having powerful cravings for fat and sugar. I tried curbing this by allowing myself one cheat day a week, but it seems like doing that negates any progress I make on weight loss. Then I get discouraged on top of being hAngry. The frustrating thing is I don't go totally insane on cheat days. Where every other day of the week I'm primarily eating greens, whole grains and lean proteins with small quantities of fruits, nuts and cheese, on my cheat day I might get myself a couple slices of pizza, a burger or something else indulgent for my dinner with some sort of sugary treat for dessert. On a cheat day I might consume 2400-2600 calories as opposed to the usual 2000. The no-duh response is going to be, ""give up the cheat day"" but here's the thing - I'm not going to be able to keep this up if I'm not allowed to have treats. I'm not a model or a Hollywood starlet; overly strict dietary restrictions just aren't going to work for me. I feel like it's better for me to plan the occasional indulgence then never allow myself to have anything sweet or greasy and end up falling off the wagon with a nasty ice cream binge or something equally disastrous. If I changed it to once every two weeks do you think it would help?  


Part of the weight loss struggle is due to the fact that I'm still working with my Doctor to get my thyroid levels under control since the bad med fiasco buggered things up; but I should still be able to lose weight, albeit slowly. So does anyone have any suggestions? Reading through the posts on here I'm not expecting to be handled with kid gloves, though I humbly request no out-right cynical or hateful responses. Many thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this novella, many more thanks to anyone who has advice to offer.  
",Self-described fatty seeking advice. (Long)
fatpeoplestories,"I am new to posting, however, I have been reading this subreddit for about a year.  I decided to make my first post because I finally have a story to tell that is worth telling.

I work for a small company.  The owners are really into fitness.  For example as a part of our compensation package we get a free annual session with a dietician and free annual gym memberships.  Also we get 5 competition days a year.  You can use your competition days if you participate in physical competition (5K, Mud Run, Cross Fit et...) you can take a prep or recovery day before or after.  Of all the employees we have three small fats and two full on planets.  Let’s call the planets Thing 1 and Thing 2.  Everyone else is human. 

 So...every quarter our bosses do something fun for the office.  Water park tickets (that’s a whole other post), catered lunches, outings, you get the idea.  Well last quarter they brought in a chest freezer and kept it stocked with individual servings of a premium ice cream.  When word of this was announced Thing 1 who is the assistant for the boss decided she would be the arbiter of the ice cream and as the bosses assistant she flexed her role to do just that.  Thing 2 was royally pissed.  Our bosses ordered enough ice cream for employees and visitors.  When the first shipment arrived Thing 1 announced that everyone could have two ice creams a day.  Of course if each employee took two a day there would be no ice cream for visitors.  Our manager brought this up to Thing 1 but she dismissed it.  Fast forward two weeks, Thing 1 and Thing 2 have a huge blow out.  Apparently Thing 1 decides someone was taking ‘more than their fare share’ of ice cream so Thing 1 moves the freezer into her office and creates a spreadsheet.  Each time you want an ice cream you had to go in Thing 1’s office and ‘sign out’ your ice cream.  Now everyone in the office including the bosses are way to busy to get involved in this nonsense so most of us stop eating ice cream all together.  Of course shipments of ice cream are still coming.  Fast forward a month.  So one Friday afternoon, the bosses come in and decide we are going to have a lunch party.  Thing 1 and Thing 2 stop their feud all of the sudden to order the food.  Boss 1 decided to roll the freezer full of ice cream into the conference room.  Thing 1 and Thing 2 and one small fat all looked at each other.  Something was up.  Apparently, while there should have been a freezer full of ice cream, there was not.  It turns out that when everyone did not eat their ‘allotted’ ice cream Thing 1, Thing 2 and one of the small fats decided they could have the left overs each week.  Now my bosses never get angry, but when they get quiet you know some shit is about to happen.  Both bosses were very quiet.  There were six ice creams in the freezer, there should have been at least four cases.  Eventually the food arrives and of course the fats ordered desserts too, and extra two liter soda’s (just in case someone wanted diet soda).  Party goes on as normal.  The next day, Boss 2 calls Thing 1, Thing 2 and small fat into his office.  Boss 2 is former military and does not mince words.  After getting the full story - Boss 2 terminates Thing 2 and small fat on the spot.  Thing 1 is given the option of 90 days probation.  Thing 1 knows she has a good thing so accepts.  The Bosses send out a joint email summarizing what happened.  Apparently Thing 2 and small fat placed additional orders for ice cream under Thing 1’s name.  Every Saturday (we are closed on weekends) all three would come to the office to divide up the ‘left over’ ice cream.  This cost the company about $1,400!  $1,400 worth of ice cream.  No one knows why Thing 1 was given a second chance.  This is what infuriates me about fats, why sacrifice a great job, with a great company for a few hundred dollars worth of ice cream.  Side note; we believe two of the other small fats had an idea something was happening.  Because they purchased a mini-fridge/freezer to keep their stash of ice cream at their desk.  My colleague tells me the freezer part of the mini-fridge was completely packed with ice cream.

Update:  I found the ice cream online.  It retails near me for $4.49 for a box of three and each bar is 290 calories.  I am sure my Bosses were paying less, however, even at $4.49 that is 933 Individual ice creams or 38 cases over just a few months.  Holy cow!  I never really put it in that perspective.     Also over 270,000 calories.  Ugh.  Maybe Thing 2 and small fat are living off the ice creams.",Office Ice Cream Fiasco

Reading this reddit for a few years has been AWESOME; an incredibly, irascibly, unabashedly empowering tool to cut through the bullshit we tell ourselves to make fat be ""OK"". Being huge is NOT OK. You are exceeding design specifications for the craft. Illogical. Here's my rule: Don't let your valid reasons turn into lifelong excuses. I know how i got fat, I know how to not be fat, simple physiology.  Now, it is entirely up to me if i reach my goal weight of 140. Meat, leaves, nuts &amp; seeds. Traded beer for whiskey.

fatpeoplestories,"Y'all asked, I delivered. 

I am shit at replying to comments, sorry. Its just way too tedious and involves a lot of repetition (waiting for the downvotes for this statement, teehee!)
Just getting straight to the point here.

Be me: Rattatagirl, 23, 121 lbs at 170cm. Look like a poor man's version of Blake Lively. 

RatBF: 25, 160 lbs at 185 cm. Very handsome. Almost Chris Hemsworth handsome &lt;3 &lt;3

Definetely dont be: Planetbitch, around 27-28, approx 300-320 lbs at 160 cm. Looks like Amy Schumer but definitely fatter with very bad skin and mottled teeth. She also got a typical SJW hair job done over the weekend: Butch cut in a shade of cranberry red. 

Here comes the beetus juice!

Some of you commenters pointed out that it was strange how my friends believed the other account. fair enough. I will be honest, i have not been the most social person in the past year. I lost a parent, a close friend, and a pet and that has led me to withdraw into a shell. I just dont like spending time with people very much anymore (except RatBF of course) and thus havent seen a lot of friends in quite some time.

This is how people believed the other account as being true. Also remember, RatBF and I were out of town with our phones switched off over the weekend . Of course, some friends thought it fishy and were checking in. I didnt think to mention all this in the last story, maybe I should have. Perhaps then ye Sherlocks here would have found another loophole.

So.

RatBF was absolutely boiling mad when we found out about the fake account. He wanted to march right over to Planetbitch's home and tear her out but i managed to calm him down enough to wait until Monday.

Monday rolls around and RatBF marches in, all ready for a confrontation. Planetbitch doesnt seem to be around though. BF decides to wait awhile. He wants to speak to the lardo before going to HR.

He waits an hour. Planetbitch is still not around. His friend SpecsBoi comes in. Starts to ask about me. Says it seemed weird, fake, fishy, etc. Also suspected Planetbitch since she constantly made snide comments about me when I dropped by to visit BF at times. Comments to the tune of ""Oh, RatBF could so much better. Look at him, he is a freaking greek god"" or ""she just looks washed out, like a dishrag"" or the classic ""she is way too skinny and has zero curves. RatBF probably just feels guilty to leave her now after this long""

and then came this clincher:

SpecsBoi: Oh the weekend you were away, a bunch of us from the office went out to dinner. Just an impromptu thing. Planetbitch learnt about it from SilkBabe (another friend, not relevent to the story) and tagged along. 

Side note: At lunch she ate two plates of onion rings, grazed off everyone else's plates, fried chicken, a double bacon cheeseburger and two cheesecakes for dessert. 

SpecsBoi: Funny part is, she didnt talk very much (usually is a BIG talker) and was mostly typing away on her phone all the time. we ignored her for the most part. then just as we are finishing up, she places her phone on the table and goes ""I wish RatBF was here. He would have had such an amazing time with us, especially since I came along too. He would have been pleasantly surprised! I bet he's bored stiff at XXXX with RattataGirl. 

DirtyJokesGuy (not important to the story, another colleague): I don't think so. Other parts of him may well be stiff though, all weekend long I'll bet! *cue laughter from the men and eye rolls from the girls* that RattataGirl is hot...

Plantebitch flares up. ""Hot? You think that malnourished, anorexic blond twig is hot? You have no taste. I'll have you know, RattataGirl wasnt always so thin. She used to be curvy. I'll bet RatBF fell for her when she had curves and now he cannot leave her out of guilt for having lost them. He is miserable, believe me. I can see it in his eyes **barf**

SpecsBoi: How do you know all this? You couldn't possibly have known RattataGirl before joining this company

Planetbitch: That is not important. I just know things. He'll leave her soon enough, you'll see. He told me once that he was tired of her bitchy attitude now that she has become thin and thinks she is a supermodel. She makes his life hell and constantly berates her. Once he and I were drinking together last Tuesday (never happened, he and I were grocery shopping that evening) and he told me he felt attracted to me since the day I walked in, but he cannot make it obvious as RattataGirl will find out and he doesnt want to hurt her...

Everyone just kinda asked her to stop discussing our private life and the discussion mostly petered out.

Y'all probably wondering what is up with the ""she wasn't always so skinny part""

I used to weigh around 155-160 lbs when I met RatBF. Nothing too bad for my height and I like to believe I carried it well. RatBF himself was a little pudgy at about 190-195 lbs. Still looked soooo good. Anyway, he and I mutually decided to get healthier, cut down on carbs and refined sugar, exercise more, the works.

How does Planetbitch know about this though? Hmm, I wonder...

She's been stalking me on Facebook and Instagram and has gone on to find pictures of me from waaaay back to six years. Yep, that's how.

Anyway, this angered BF no end. He decided to go to HR straightaway without speaking to Planetbitch. 

About half an hour later, he stormed out of HR's office. Now I dunno if this makes sense or not, but the lady in there said ""it is more a private matter and had RattataGirl been an employee of this company, we could have taken action. However, she isn't. I know you have screenshots and while this does indicate that Planetbitch may have done it, there is no definitive proof to accuse her of anything. Please sort this out among yourselves.""

Well whaddya know? Once he gets back to her seat, there she is. New haircut and all. She has not noticed him yet and is busy talking to a female coworker. She is wearing a sleeveless top as usual, showing off the armpit fuzz. But she is also wearing REALLY chunky bracelets. A female coworker was asking her what was up with the bracelets when she never wore jewelry before. 

Planetbitch: Oh, nothing. Cockles (her cat, one of three) and I were playing over the weekend and he scratched me all over. This is just to hide that.

RatBF looks more closely now.

""Oh HEYYYYYYY RatBF, there you are!! It's soooo good to see you, how was your weekend? I'll bet you missed meeeeeeee!"" she caterwauls. 

RatBF ignores all that and just takes her hand. 

""I don't think a cat did that, Planetbitch"", he snarled.

Yes, those were self-inflicted scars. That she needed to take pictures of so she could prove to the world that I was anorexic.

This might just be a series, you guys!


",Jealous Planetbitch - update
fatpeoplestories,"  This story is from a friend of mine,Joe,and about this guy,who we'll call Tank,for reasons that will become apparent later on.The cast is as follows:Joe,one of my besties,who had the displeasure of serving in the same Army unit as Tank; Tank,who is possibly the most socially maladjusted fat person I have ever seen,mind you,I had a funky thyroid as a child and I know the struggle.

  The story begins in Basic Training,more specifically,the first day after you are conscripted.The Barracks Officer was teaching the recruits how to do their beds,or what is called a ''folder''.Tank immediately told him,without permission,and with an inappropriate tone of voice,that he is entitled to a special ''fat-proof bed''.He was thrown in prison for two days for insulting a superior officer.Great start,might I add.During the second day,the camp's medical staff assigned the recruits into ""groups of similar physical/mental ability"",a process that categorises the recruits based on their physical,health and mental condition into five different groups,ranging from I1,the highest (which means ''normal person''),to I5, (which means ''kinda crazy,but not crazy enough to be exempt from conscription"").Tank,being a hefty boi,was assigned as a category I3 troop with obesity.He was furious.Joe could see his face change colour and become redder and redder.He eventually lashed out verbally at one of the medical evaluators,who turned out to be the only enlisted military doctor in the camp,the other guys are either graduates from Med School doing their service,or simply other recruits from the previous order of conscription who have been given special training.Needless to say,he got disciplined again for insulting a superior officer,earning him two more days in the brig.But alas,the fat idiot doesn't learn his lesson,no,no,no.

  During Basic,the recruits are trained in patrolling the camp and in camp security in general,among everything else.During that fateful night,Joe and some random guy are out patrolling,and Tank with some other random guy are scheduled to relieve them. After the shift change was done,Tank pointed out that he was very hungry.What does he decide to do?Order in of course!You don't need me to point out that this isn't allowed.The other guard (I love you,you beautiful bastard) snitched on him via shortwave radio and an MP came,waited for the delivery man to arrive,forced Tank to take the food and pay for it,confiscated the food,tore Tank's proverbial ear off,and took the food with him as he returned to the MP station,literally feasting on it as he walked slowly,so Tank could see him do it.All the while,Tank cursed at him under his breath.He got a warning for this and was transferred to latrine duty,on the express order of the aforementioned Barracks Officer might I add.For some time after that,things calmed down,minus the occasional shit-talking against the cooks in the Mess Hall.But amidst the quiet,an invisible enemy emerged.The bioterror attack that was his smell.

   Tank,in protest for the (literal) shit he had been going through,did not maintain his hygiene and as a result reeked. In fact,he reeked so badly,the bedsheets were washed separately from the others',to avoid ruining the entire lot.Soon enough,the others in the barracks were sick of Tanks' antics.So,they devised a plan; arrest Tank,force him to bathe,and in case he resists,give him the ol' Regimental Scrubdown.The wheels were set in motion.Tank was swiftly arrested by the fellow recruits,while the MP's patrolling the barracks watched while laughing,the guys shoved him in a shower,but Tank was defiant to the very end.He made the decision to resist.What the guys did to him became a part of the camp's ""history"",and was known as ""The Cleansing"".They furiously scrubbed him with mops,sprayed hot water on him and dumped three or so bottles of soap on him,all the while three dudes in full BDU were restraining him.The MP walked in,smiled and told them not to hurt him.The camp's commander didn't bat an eye,as soon as he learned who was the recipient of ""The Cleansing"".

   Finally,we get to how our boi acquired his illustrious nickname.In fact,before he acquired the nickname ""Tank"" he was known as ''The fat-ass from Barracks C-2"".After Basic,the recruits are sworn and are shipped to ""Specialist School"",so they can learn specific skills,like operating certain weapons and vehicles.Joe's unit was an armored unit,so naturally,most of the recruits would be trained in operating the various armored vehicles and some of them would learn to use anti-tank launchers.Tank had submitted a form stating that he wanted to be considered for training as a ""CMBT"",which is an acronym for ""Commander Medium Battle Tank"",and for some reason,the Headmaster approved this.Joe was assigned as a driver in Tank's crew and during the first phase of his training,he would train under an other CMBT who belonged to the Army Training Corps,until Tank finished his theoretical education into the different aspects of being a CMBT and engaging the enemy in battle.As per standard procedure,after Tank finished his theoretics,he was embedded as a CMBT in Joe's tank.On a side note,Joe is one of the lucky fuckers in the Corps that got to play with a Leopard 2HEL.On the fateful day of Tank's appointment as a CMBT,after he was given the Black Beret,he was ordered to embark the tank for immediate departure.Joe was signaled from the outside and he started the engine,all systems go,gun ready,shell in the barrel.AND THEN THE FAT RETARD GOT STUCK IN THE HATCH.He broke out in tears and was taken away to the Officer's Lounge to cool off.After that incident,the brass put him in charge of an ARV,on which he could embark without getting stuck.

   Unfortunately,Tank became fairly well behaved after the hatch incident,so no more shenanigans.Remember kids:if you want to play with tanks,you gotta eat small.",The tale of Tank

fatpeoplestories,"Long time lurker, first time poster, ya know the drill. 
This happened just a week ago and I am still seething. 

Be me: Rattatagirl, 22, 121 lbs at 170cm. Look like a poor man's version of Blake Lively. Yeah, really. 

RatBF: 25, 160 lbs at 185 cm. Very handsome. 

Definetely dont be: Planetbitch, age unknown, approx 300 lbs at 160 cm. Looks like Amy Schumer but definitely fatter with very bad skin and mottled teeth. Ew. 

RatBF and I have been dating since 6 years. We openly engage in PDA, both on and off social media. Not ashamed. Recently I noticed a girl who I had never heard of (I know all of his friends) commenting on every picture he posted. Literally.every.picture.

Comments on the lines of:

""oooh my my! Someones looking hawt""

""damn, son. Where can we find more like you?""

""you are a sight for sore eyes""

""my heart just stopped. Need cpr please!"" 

Important to note, she only commented on pictures of just himself. Pictures with me got the snub. Asked him who she was, mildly amused. 

He closes his eyes tight and breathes hard. Says she is a new coworker. Bf works in sales division of pharma company. Says she keeps dropping innuendo every single day. Asks me to ignore her. Whatever, I'm not too bothered. 

Bf and I went to a cute little bed n breakfast thing out of town for the weekend. Phone switched off for two days. Nice, nice sexytimes.

When we returned back to civilization, my phone blew up. Several of my friends plus some of RatBF's had buzzed me in a panic. Many offered condolences, sympathies and what not. All said they were there for me. Wonder wtf happened.

Turns out someone made a fake account in my name. Posted status updates about an eating disorder, how I purged after every meal, how I consumed laxatives on the regular, going so far as to posting a picture of laxative tablets I supposedly consumed, and scratch marks on wrists allegedly made while forcing myself to throw up.

Guess what though. The wrists were clearly much plumper than mine.

How do I know it was her? The laxatives were produced by the same company BF works for. And she photographed them on HIS FUCKING DESK. ",Jealous planetbitch
fatpeoplestories,"Hi there, Mel0 here. I'm a frequent lurker but I've only posted a few times a while back. This won't be anything magnanimous but I sort of had a mini-meltdown because of this stupid ham that's been plaguing our office for the past 3 weeks so I figured I'd share. 

*  *Me, Mel0:* 22, 5'5 and 130lbs down from 160lbs in late 2017. 
* *HT, HamTemp*: mid-30's, 5'3 and... maybe 300lbs? 320lbs? It gets hard to tell after a while.

Our company hired a temp a few weeks back to help us out with our annual audit. The staffing agency usually sends over a list of resumes and we choose who we'd like to hire. They've never let us down before, so when they said they were short-handed and could only offer two choices, we didn't think twice about hiring the first person they suggested as we were short on time. 

Boy was that a mistake. 

Monday morning of the first week, HT walks in wearing (you guessed it) a crop top and a maxi skirt. Not even mentioning the fact that a crop-top is super not appropriate for a professional office setting (with few exceptions that I can think of), the sheer sight of her prominent muffin-top jiggling about as she vivaciously greeted her new co-workers was enough to make we want to cancel my dinner plans. She's super sweet to everyone she meets, but the moment it's my turn for ""huggles"", she stops short and gives me the typical ""oh ur obv a basic skiiny bish look at mah CURVZ"" once-over that a lot of HAES-advocates seem to have perfected. I ignore it. Who cares, right?

It's worth noting that besides her, I'm the only female employee of this company. We run an active machine shop, so in the 2 years I've been here I've pretty much become the resident nice girl / eye candy for most of the shop guys -- I don't mind, they're all very sweet and respectful, but it's pretty obvious to anyone who works with us for more than a week that many of them are into me. That being said, this did not sit well with HT *at all.* Despite being admonished for her crop top, she seemingly came in every day attempting to out-slut her outfit from the day before. Mind you, I'm wholly in favor of ""wear what you want to wear and dgaf what other people think"", but short shorts are NOT APPROPRIATE for an office setting. It doesn't matter what your body-type is. And the layers and layers of makeup on her wrinkly face may not have been inappropriate, but it was still gross and tacky. Needless to say, all her attempts at seducing the office staff and the shop guys were shut down in the nicest way possible. And that's when the thieving began. 

First, it was the tape measure that I keep handy at my desk in case someone needs it. Then, it was a variety of office supplies. Note pads, pencils, even the special pens I order for myself that no one else uses because they bleed through paper something fierce. Then, it was my two-hole punch that I use many times a day, that again NO ONE else uses besides me. Specialty grid paper that costs a FUCK TON to order. Entire reams of printer paper. Boxes upon boxes of first-aid supplies. Elements of various co-worker's lunches from the communal fridge. All gone. 

Pissed that a lot of my belongings disappeared, I made a *kind* announcement to the entirety of the office staff that my things were missing and to please return them because I bought them with my own money blah blah blah. Agreements all around, except from HT, who loudly proclaimed that since they were technically in the office, anyone should be allowed to use them whenever they want, and that just because I had the ""special privilege"" of buying my own supplies (*wtf*?) didn't mean that I got to dictate who used those supplies. Luckily, she was the only one with that mindset, and the announcement concluded with no other issues. 

A week and a half later (ca. last Thursday), I come back from lunch and the office is empty aside from HT. So I stand by the kitchenette unpacking my things when I see her get up from  her seat, walk over to my desk, and grab a handful of markers that I'd just brought in from home for a project, and *dump them in the fucking waste bin by the office exit.* That was pretty much the straw that broke the camel's back, so I rushed in ranting and raving and telling her that if she ever touched my shit again, I'd have her fired on the spot. My boss heard the commotion and came in from the meeting room a moment later, and before I could so much as get a word in, HT turns on the waterworks and starts accusing me of threatening to fire her, discriminating against her because of her weight, and causing ""emotional damages"" (what is it with Hams and this phrase???). My boss knows me pretty well, so he asked me what happened. 

After explaining the situation and watching HT turn red as an apple as my boss picked the markers out of the trash, she began to shake and sob, claiming that at first she hadn't *meant* to do that, but I'd been *so* unreasonable about her ""kundishuns"" that she didn't have a choice (bullshit)! I asked her what the problem was -- turns out she was too fucking lazy to walk fifty feet to the supply closet down the hall when she needed something, so she thought she'd walk over to my desk and just help herself to my things because ""MUH KNEES"" (bullshit) and also standing/walking is hard for her (also bullshit). And the reason she threw out my expensive markers was because she was bipolar and that meant that she had a natural affinity to hurt people (ULTRA bullshit and at this point I wasn't even listening anymore). 

My boss just sighed and shook his head, which is his way of saying ""Mel0, just handle this"", and walked out. So I clarified to her that my desk wasn't fucking Office Depot, and if she wanted something she needed to walk her ass over the supply closet and get it her fucking self. Her response was that ""life isn't as easy for me as it is for you tall, skinny people!!!!"". Which makes me wonder where all her HAES crap is now. 

It's been about a week now and HT hasn't spoken to me. Pretty sure she's currently in my boss' office whining about something or other that I made her do (I'm in charge of managing the auditing process, no idea why but I guess this is my life now). Thankfully her stint as a temp ends this week so maybe my shit will finally stay on my desk where it belongs. ",Office Hamtitlement at its Finest
fatpeoplestories,"My mother has intense fatlogic and follows those dumb snakeoil ""doctors"" like dr axe and the like. She got diagnosed with diabetes, and I sure as fuck hope I am being a hypochondriac, but my toes are fucking tingling and I refuse to lose my feet because my mom believes in HAES crap. I have never believed in it, but I have social anxiety and I'm docile, so when my mom reinforces my overeating I give in. She'll say i'm overreacting when I try to calorie count and actually made me fatter by forcing me to go through some garbage ""gluten free"" diet when I was younger that just involved a ton of bacon and other high calorie shit, I went from 190 to 300 pounds at the age of 12-14.

It's not just her fault, it's mine. I want to stand up to her and tell her to fuck off when she does this to me, but I have not developed a spine. I have not developed self control so I can't trust myself, even.

fatpeoplestories,"Hi all you lovely people from around the world, and a BIGGER^teehee hello to the trolls!

After writing the Athena series, I really didn't think I would have anything new to post here yet here I am again, only 12 days later. No, this isn't about Athena, as I fortunately haven't encountered her again. However, I recently experienced some fatlogic which definitely belongs on this sub.

In fact, after this incident took place, my first desire was to ~~punch something, wallow in self pity, then eat a tub of ice-cream~~ come post it on reddit.

Cast of characters:

Me, 26 F, 138 lbs at 5'5, down from 212 lbs in October 2017 (yay swimming, long walks and sugar control)

Butterfly, a good friend, approx 180-185 lbs at 5'4. Trying to lose the excess flab. Very pretty despite it with lovely beachy waves of hair, light brown eyes with long lashes, and a flawless complexion

Bumblebee, 29 M, 6'1 (more on him later, wait for it, ye greedies!)


Onto the tale!

So I have been on a dedicated weight-loss journey since close to a year and have managed to shed a considerable amount of flab. What triggered this was a failed relationship with a guy who was crazy about me since we were 16 (and I weighed 122 lbs), whom I started to date when I was 23, and who subsequently lost interest in me due to my ballooning weight. Yes, I lost the weight due to/for a guy. Sue me.

Now my ex was also a very good friend of mine, and we had a common group of friends. Our breakup divided the group and I resolved never ever to date a friend again. Long work hours ensure I don’t get to meet anyone else out of my circle and also I don't want to date co-workers because HR policies make it one messy affair^cuewordplay. Enter the saviour of all singletons ~~LOLOLOL~~ Tinder!


So I downloaded the dratted app, got a friend to click some fresh pictures, wrote a pithy bio, the works.

Got down to swiping, **left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, maybe-right-oops-picture with drugged tiger-left, left, left, OH right** you know the drill...

I had swiped right on about 10-15 men on the first day, matched with all. By the end of the day, I had hit it off with three of the lot. This process went on till five-six days by which time I had zeroed in on four potential relationship-material men. One of these was Bumblebee. 

Yes, he seemed a bit heavy but he was also tall. Nothing too bad. He seemed to dress well, had an interesting bio free of spelling errors, none of the pretentious posing-next-to-a-celebrity or flanked-by-girls-way-out-of-my-league pictures. He was very witty and seemed like a true gentleman. We exchanged numbers, chatted for two weeks, and then decided to meet (you can call me a prude, whatever).

We met one Monday evening at an upscale coffee shop-patisserie thing. He was as tall as his Tinder profile said, phew. Yeah we all love tall guys, mkay?

But you surely saw this coming:
 
He was a good 30-40 lbs heavier. Approximately 270-280 lbs. His hair was longer than in the pictures, a little greasy (too much Brylcreem, an Indian scourge), and he wore dark sunglasses. Yes, inside the building. No, it wasn't dark. 

However, the date went smoothly. He was funny, an attentive listener, smelled nice. We spent two pleasant hours together before parting ways, promising to catch a movie and dinner later in the week.

My phone battery had drained by the end of the date. I went home and charged it up to find several texts from him saying he had a great time, that I looked even better in person, and that he couldn't wait to see me again. 

The next day, I was discussing the date with some of my friends at work. It is important to note here that I hadn't given my friends much details about the guy. I didn't want to, until I was sure I would see him again, otherwise what was the point? Anyway, so a few other friends also use Tinder. Butterfly is one of them.

When I showed his pictures to the girls, Butterfly goes ""OH, wuuuut? He is on my list of matches too! In fact we are meeting tomorrow night!""

Okay then. That stung a little, I will admit. Of course, Bumblebee and I were hardly exclusive. Still, it stung a little to find out he had already planned a date just two days after meeting me, someone he referred to as his ""best, most honest Tinder match ever""

But being the scheming little devils we are, Butterfly and I decided to have some fun with this. It was so decided that Butterfly would go on the date after all, not tell him that she and I knew each other, and see how things went. Secretly, I wanted to test him. I wanted to know if he used the same lines on all girls. Yes, this was a female shit test. Don't tell me you wouldn't have done the same, my FPS sisters **wink wink**

So onto the Butterfly-Bumblebee date.

I was glued to my phone for updates. Butterfly sent me pictures of her all dolled up before the date. They were to meet for dinner at a smart pub. The girl had really dolled herself up: knee-length midnight blue skater dress, three-inch strappy silver heels, blow-dried hair, light, skilful makeup. She looked sensational.

She sent me a flurry of texts once she reached the pub. She was nervous, excited. This was her fourth Tinder date and her experiences had been less-than-pleasant thus far: one guy was eight years older than he claimed, another was looking for polyamorous relationships (Butterfly wasn't), the third was just a bore.

Bumblebee got there 15 minutes late. She shot off a last ""OMG he's here, byeeeeeeee"" text to me before the date commenced.

Radio silence for three hours. So the date is going well, I surmised. No problem, I had several other interesting matches. I hadn't yet agreed to meet any though, because I am an idiot who latches on to one guy if she finds him interesting. I know, I know, that isn't how it works on Tinder. I am learning, people.

Anyway, Butterfly finally texts me at 12 PM. She's been on the date since 8. 

""OMG Kinvara, it went so well! Bumblebee is such an interesting guy, so polite, such a gentleman, and so intelligent. He can talk about anything and everything. He said he was amazed at how lovely I looked and that we would meet soon. Girl, can you please please pretty please let me have him? Come onnnnn, I've been on such shitty dates and this was just your first. I'll owe you one!""

I was honestly happy that she had had a nice time, but I was also ticked off at his smoothness and all the mirror-image glib remarks. He was clearly a 'playa'. I thought about ""letting Butterfly have him"", but heck. Even I thought he was interesting and wanted to see how things progressed. Cue major confusion. Solution? Re-watch 'Spoils of War' for the leventy-leventh time and doze off.

The next day Butterfly, I, and our coterie excitedly discussed the details of our respective dates with Bumblebee and compared notes. Just then Bumblebee pinged me confirming our plans for the weekend, adding to that an ""I literally cannot wait to see your lovely smile again"" text followed by a heart and wink emoji.

""Butterfly, he'll soon text you now too. Let's see if he does a copy-paste job!"" I trilled gaily.

""Haha"" Butterfly gave a feeble smile and looked at her phone. We all waited for the telltale beep of a WhatsApp notification.

None came.

Butterfly looked absolutely deflated. This was getting awkward. All of us quickly remembered ' pending work' and returned to our respective desks. Derp, this was not so nice.

I went round to Butterfly's desk around lunchtime. She looked forlorn. 

""Babe, what's up? You don't look so good?"" I asked cautiously. 

She hesitated a while before blurting out ""Bumblebee said yesterday that he would meet me again soon, but I just realised a while ago that we made no concrete plans. He made a proper movie-dinner plan with you. He texted you. He hasn't messaged me once since last night. I dunno Kinvara, everything seemed to have gone so smoothely…then this..."" and she buried her face in her hands. She was visibly upset. 

I tried to comfort her and said things like don't you worry, he will text soon, he must be busy making plans with you etc etc. I even went on to say things like ""babe, he spent over four hours with you and only two with me, clearly he liked you better"" blah blah...this cheered her up a little. I prayed he would text her soon. Now my decision was clear. Butterfly obviously liked him more than I did and they had actually been talking a week longer. I would step aside.

Anyway, the much-awaited text from him never came. I did not want to tell Butterfly that he had been texting me non-stop all day. 

Another day passed with Butterfly waiting for Bumblebee's text with bated breath. She jumped at each ping, checking it immediately to see if it was his. She even started taking her phone into the loos.

This was disturbing. I finally told her that he had been texting me regularly. She had also seen him online several times but did not ping him so as not to come across as too eager. My confession broke her resolve. 

""Fuck this, I'll just text him. I cannot stand the suspense."" She said in a small but determined voice.

I went back to my desk. Ten minutes later, I saw Butterfly rush to the loos with one fist balled at her mouth. I knew something was wrong. I ran in after her. I could hear her sobbing behind one of the locked cubicles. I begged her to come out and tell me what happened. It took me ten minutes of cajoling till she finally stepped out. 

""Let's go out for a walk please"" she said, as several other women near the mirrors were staring at her.

We stepped out of the office and as soon as we were out of earshot, I asked her what happened. She just showed me her phone.

""Hey Butterfly, yes I had a lovely time with you that night. But I have been giving it some thought...I enjoyed your company but am honestly not attracted to you. I am sorry but you are a little too chubby for my liking. I am sorry if I gave you any false hopes. Cheers!""

This from a guy at least 100 lbs heavier than her. A guy with greasy hair who wears dark sunglasses indoors. 

Just then my phone buzzed with a notification. It was him, sending pictures of a romantic sea-facing restaurant where he wanted to take me to for dinner Saturday evening. 

""Hey babe, so this is where we will go. Cannot wait to show you off, I'm a regular here. Dress pretty and maybe I will reward you later in the night! ;)"" followed.


Butterfly then looked at my face, sad and torn. But I could see her expression changing to bewilderment as I started to grin.

""Just wait"" I said to her, still grinning. 

I typed away on my phone. Then switched off my internet connection. Showed her what I typed. She read the message through her tears.

Then she burst out laughing, clutching her stomach.

""Hey Bumblebee. I had a lovely time with you Monday evening. But I have been giving it some thought...I enjoyed your company but am honestly not attracted to you. I am sorry but you are a little too chubby for my liking. I am sorry if I gave you any false hopes. Cheers!""-- this was what I typed.

fatpeoplestories,"Hey all, I finally came to terms with the fact that I am fat guy, but I have lost some weight around 25 pounds to be exact---from 236 to 209. I am twenty-one-years-old and am 5'5"", so it's become quite apparent that I am fat. However, my fatlogic seems to keep biting me in the ass. I've lost all hope in myself because of moderate depression and being that guy who plays video games a bit too much--- like 5-10 hours a week, yet I spend much more time thinking about eating because it had been my only coping mechanism before I got diagnosed. Likewise, I saw a picture of myself from earlier in high school and looked healthy and couldn't stop crying because five years and countless amounts of fatty foods helped me reach this disgusting size. Well, you're probably wondering how I ended up this fat. I'll tell you. Around 4 ish years ago my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and had passed around two years and two months ago. Throughout this period, we ate out a lot especially towards the end, but I was able to manage it because I worked out through swimming and playing basketball with my friends. College came around and I hit the ground running towards the freshman 15's, but that ended up being the freshman 20 which got me upto around 196. During my sophomore year, I passed through a long period of depression which led me to eat upto 5400 calories. I generally eat, as of now, closer to 2000 per day. I am just in aw of the absolute unit I've become; however, I am actively trying to change this through working more and tracking my calories. I meditate on almost every situation, and I have been so happy with what success I've had. During my vacation, I ended up not getting ice cream twice when it was offered, or I would get the smallest size possible. I still got to enjoy the sweet treat, but I focused on the beauty of returning to a normal size. I just want to thank everyone for sharing their stories here, and I really find a lot of inspiration in what you guys post. I'll keep in touch with updates as well as stories.

fatpeoplestories,"Welcome back to the Ariana Saga! Sorry for the delay, I've been quite busy recently. This is the third part, the first two can be found here:

Part One: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/8zwp6h/the\_ariana\_saga\_begin\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/8zwp6h/the_ariana_saga_begin_again/)

In the last part, me, Ariana, and three other friends had chosen a good student house to live in. One of these people, the friend of one of the other residents who I did not know, would become good friends with me before we moved into house. I'll call him Jack. It's a pseudonym, of course. I don't think he'd mind this series of stories, but I'll keep it vague, mainly so Ariana doesn't find out. The garden of the house we where moving into was impressive. It was quite large, with a good sized shed. Behind, there was nothing but fields and one one side, a huge hedge the height of the house, blocking the view from the neighbouring house, including that from the upper windows. The house on the other side was empty and thus the garden was not overlooked by anyone and was nice and private. When I was a kid, my parents bought a massive inflatable swimming pool. It was around 7ft deep and maybe 10ft wide and close to 20ft long, pretty large for what was, essentially, a paddling pool. Me and Jack decided that this pool, along with some pool toys he had, would make a great addition to the house. We would move in my mid-September, and set the pool up as it was unseasonable warm. The pool will be relevant later.

Ariana would move in a few weeks later, at the last possible moment before her course started. She had the largest room, which had a double bed, as she had, apparently, a boyfriend. I didn't know this but she had the boyfriend all through the previous year, and they would break up and get back together every few weeks, according to those that where closer to her. She brought the boyfriend with her when she moved in, with him carrying all her stuff of course. He was, visually, very similar to Ariana, around 300lbs, but otherwise quite plain, with a baby face that made him look years younger than he actually was. Ariana was delighted that her boyfriend could stay now she had a double bed, (evidently the two could not fit into the large single bed she had previously) and was also delighted that her boyfriend possessed an advanced and rare form of technology in Ariana's eyes, his very own car. This was an odd thing to be happy about, because three of the five people in the house had their own car, the university was a 10 minute walk away (quicker than driving as you could cut through a car park), and the shops in town where only 15 minutes away on foot, with a bus stop minutes from our door. Later, Ariana would not leave the house unless she was being driven, but eventually realised she would actually have to suffer through the gruelling 10 minute walk to the university, as no one would drive her a distance that would be quicker to walk, especially after fighting for a parking. Before we moved in, Ariana would frequently complain about being exposed to ""male habits"" now that we would all be living in closing proximity to one another and sharing a bathroom. Obviously, everyone in the house was reasonable in ensuring each other's privacy, with knocks on doors and no walking around naked and such. I assumed Ariana was afraid of something like this and thus her fears would not be realised, however I was wrong. I first thought something was up when she complained that she had see one of us go to have a shower in a morning in just a towel, which seems totally reasonable, but not for Ariana. She asked the guy who used the towel to wear clothes, despite the fact that the journey to the shower was three steps at most, and any normal person would think a towel or dressing gown would suffice. She would also be mad whenever anyone left a toothbrush, razor, or anything else in the bathroom, as she didn't want to see ""disgusting things"" as she called them. Surprising no-one, she would leave her many bottles of bubble bath, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner all over the shower/bath, leaving little room for everyone else's things. She would also wash her hair every few days before she went to bed, but this would be at 1 or 2 in the morning, not the ideal time for a shower, as it would keep me awake. I asked her to simply wash her air a few hours earlier but she did not listen.

She was, however, the worst offender in the kitchen. We had enough space for each person to have one shelf in the fridge and one draw in the freezer, but this was not enough for her. When she wasn't eating pasta, she would eat something frozen with chips, and almost never used her fridge space and instead quickly fill her freezer draw and use everyone else's. However, every now and then her food would appear in someone's full draw and she would claim that it had space when she came to it, and the victim must have clearly forgotten that they had eaten the food or had forgotten how much was in their draw. One day, she did this to me, and a small box of four beef burgers I knew I had in my draw had vanished, with some neapolitan ice cream in their place. Ariana's contribution. I confronted her and she said she did not remember the burgers and she was looking for space, found some in my draw but nowhere else and that was it. She was right that no other draw had space, but I knew the burgers had been there, but could find no trace of them. I checked the bin, the recycling, and the other cupboards but could not find them. I then decided to check the wheelie bins outside for the packaging, and found it underneath some other trash in a wheelie bin. I knew it was her as she was the only one to not know which bin held which recycling so the cardboard packing stood out in a bin of non-recyclables. I assumed she had eaten the burgers during the day and attempted to hide the evidence. I later checked the grille and was quite greasy, and I knew that no one had used it for a while, and I also knew that Ariana was too lazy to properly wash it after she had used it. She claimed she had no idea what I was on about and claimed I had something against her, and anyone could have stolen the food. Unfortunately, one of the guys I was living with, who I will call dodger, as he avoids conflict, told me to drop and be nicer to Ariana, as she can't help being the way she is, and telling me that she was really not that bad anyway and I'm just being overly nit picky. I was annoyed at the time but I would come to realise that dodger hated conflict and would rather allow Ariana to walk all over him and than risk a confrontation with her. She would complain whenever he went to shower and he wasn't fully dressed (a dressing gown over nothing did not count in Ariana's eyes). She would often leave her stuff in dodger's kitchen cupboards and in his freezer, and would generally walk all over him because she knew she could. I did not kowtow to her increasingly outrageous demands, and would continue to take the two steps toward the shower in a morning, only wearing a towel. I convinced Jack to do the same and she eventually stopped complaining. Jack had the bottom room and there was a toilet on the bottom floor, and one day at around 3 in the morning Ariana was coming down for some food and ""caught"" Jack going from his room to the bathroom in only a pair of pyjama pants, and the very next day she asked everyone in the house to always be fully dressed because it was horrific and disgusting and wrong, among other words. If she had a genuine reason for this, everyone would have been totally accommodating, but she even complained about shorts, vests and even sometimes sweatpants so everyone did not take her seriously, apart from dodger of course. I never did understand what her problem with it was. She would frequently comment on how hot Jack was (until I told her to stop) and how it made the house nicer, so you would think she'd want him to as few clothes as possible. I think that this was the very reason why she wanted everyone as dressed up as possible, that she probably hated that she could look and not touch, so she took out her anger on some weird obsession with making sure she wouldn't be tempted.

Ariana was not the only one who had strange hang-ups with attractive men. Do you remember the pool from the start? One weekend, Ariana was at home (as she always was), so me and Jack decided to enjoy the unseasonably hot weather and use the pool. Ariana expressed no interest in the pool but she wasn't here to ensure everyone was in their burka, so me and Jack got in the pool, in swimming costumes of course. Unfortunately, Ariana had come home early with her boyfriend in tow and saw us in the pool through the window, and she came out angry, followed by her boyfriend. She was complaining that the pool was silly and pointless and how we where stupid for using it, and she then looked me up and down, then Jack, then said that we where just likes the ""whores on her course"", which I assumed was referring to girls she studied with who probably dressed quite reasonably but Ariana disliked because they where skinnier than her. Jack told her to grow up and not be such a prude, but then her boyfriend spoke up. He said that it was ""people like us"" that represented everything wrong with Western society and how everyone our age were ""degenerates"" who only cared about  drugs, sex and partying. He also said that it was men like us that where stealing all the good women by going to gym and ""converting Christian girls"". It should also be noted that he had stared at Jack's crotch during the entire speech, and frequently glancing toward mine. This was likely because Jack is, to put it delicately, an extremely well-equipped young man, whose ""equipment"" was frequently visible through clothing, especially visible in a pair of wet swimming trunks. I found this entire scene hilarious and Ariana, clearly embarrassed by her boyfriends outburst, dragged him of and out of the house, and they did not return for days. At the time I thought this rant was just funny, but now I know that the boyfriend was actually ranting about a mix on incel/alt-right talking points, equating modern society to having no moral values leading to a decline and eventual collapse, usually because women are not trusted (by people who believe this stuff) to make their own decisions, usually because they blame women for their own personal failings. Ariana's boyfriend was clearly enraged that he could only get a woman (I use this term loosely) like Ariana and not a (presumably) more attractive girlfriend, and he not only blamed women for not wanting him, but blamed more attractive men for stealing away the attractive women from him. But at the time I didn't know any of this so I just found it all hilarious.

They also look to be in a lot of pain when standing or walking out of the pool.

This story, however, bleak, is true, and it is provided to you for your leisure, to frighten you and to bring to your eyes the misery that comes from the ham's natural response to even the simplest of kindnesses.


.



Let us begin.

.

It was, about a year ago, when my wife and I decided to change our lives. We'd met, fell in love, and throughly extracted all the joys and fun that might be found from life in the city of New York. We bought an SUV, saved for the better part of a year, and eventually set off on an adventure across this country's natural splendor. Our plan had been to travel, camp, boondock, and hike until the summer's warmth dissolved into fall, at which time we would move to Denver, to take up residence and build a new, better, life. 


Having made it across the country, we found ourselves driving towards the Rockies, our few goods ready to be unpacked in new home. It took about a week until our lease was signed, and our deposit check's cashed. The flat was... unbelievable. Having come from the old buildings of the  perennially-hip Brooklyn, we had been astonished as to what 1300 a month could buy in a city that wasn't overburdened, ancient, and rent's overinflated. 


It had all seemed so perfect, so new and clean, so aesthetically elegant, and so cockroach free! it was, therefore, ripe to be sullied. And our neighbor below sought right to that. 


It was our first night; we'd begun to move in at around 3pm, and had proceeded to lug, just the two of us, not just the belongings we'd brought from our previous life, but all the furniture and whatnot we'd picked up in the week we'd been there. My wife, a petite, but dangerous woman, had taken a great share of the boxes, and helped me navigate the sofa, bed and frame through the skinny, angular hallways. By ten, the heavy lifting had been done, but the boxes, and thick compression bags, remained stacked, ready to be peeled open the following morning. We were tired, but happy. My wife, near the point of exhaustion, had all but collapsed onto our new, second hand, couch, while I moved the last of the unassembled bed frame to the bedroom. 

I had been thinking, salivating really, over the sole occupant of our virgin fridge - a bottle of brüt that'd been chilling since we'd arrived that afternoon - when I heard a loud, beleaguered, thud at our new front door. Being that I was still a bit preoccupied with the frame, my wife went to answer. 


Now, I can only relay what it was that I first *heard*, but as she opened the door, my ears pricked to a loud, heavy, grunt-of-a-wheeze. To my wife's curious ""hello?"" came a stuttering, still-wheezing, ""Uhhh yeah, are you alone?""

As I set down the last of the frame, I heard my wife reply, ""Excuse me?"" When I came to the door, I found a man of such gigantic proportions, whose face, upon seeing mine, grew even redder, shifting from the lighter shades of embarrassment, to the deep plum of fury. ""You guys need to keep it down!"" he bellowed, his thick, overburdened frame struggling to regain some semblance composure. Sweat beaded across his porous skin, leaking from below his crew cut, in rivulets down his neck, staining an already damp collar. 

Curiously, we apologized for any noise, explained that we were just moving in, and that we were done for the evening, so he shouldn't expect any more disturbance. He glared at us, his nerves flickered in the presence of such a genuine apology, or perhaps just the realization that his indignation didn't obviate his outnumbering. He smiled something pathetic, and then left after the conversational pleasantries had subsided.

Although a little taken aback, we decided to move along with the evening, and fell asleep beneath our sleeping bags on our uncovered king mattress, the last bubbles of the brüte quietly fizzing away in the near empty bottle. 

.

In truth, I had assumed that perhaps we had been a bit rude. After all, no one wants to hear heavy thudding all evening long, and perhaps for our newly acquired neighbor, it was a bit too much. 

But I had been wrong in assuming that our first interaction would be our last. 

.

Over the following days, as we unpacked, we were careful not to stomp about, careful to be considerate of our downstairs neighbor, and careful to consider the hour whenever we decided to unpack yet another box. Yet, no matter how quietly w tiptoed about, still would come the heavy rap at our door, with the even heavier wheezing to follow. 

It had taken about five days in total to not just unpack, but to buy and assemble what furniture we didnt have. Being that neither of us had yet found a job, we we're active only in the afternoons, and never, ever did we take to any project beyond 7 pm. 

But he kept coming. Each day, regardless of the day or hour, the thud would come and the wheezed complain would follow. A small scale, tucked in the back of my brain, the one one which governs one's reactions, slowly began to tip. Each thud-wheeze-departure had, like the egregious number of pounds about our neighbor's frame, collected into something monstrous.


On the sixth day, I found that I had had enough. It was Sunday morning, and we were fast asleep below the whirring ceiling fan, still comfortable in the warm light of a fall morning, when the thud came. Loud, heavy, and predictable, it pulled me right from my cozy slumber into a ticking rage. 

I sprang from bed, by what energy I do not know, and dressed in a matter of seconds. He had begun to knock again when I ripped the door away from his fist. It's lazy, heavy weight failing forward and nearly connecting with my chest. 

He began to speak, yet another rasped, bit of fat-speak, when he caught my eyes. I know now, that I must have been staring at him with a deranged, malevolent, look. His complaint, not yet all the way free from his fat, jiggling, throat, abruptly stopped, only a syllable into it's fury. 


I barked, one decibel short of a yell, ""WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU WANT?!"" 

Before his overclocked heart could move enough of his saccharine blood to compel him to answer, I continued, ""WE ARE ASLEEP.  WE ARE NOT EVEN CONSCIOUS! WHAT THE FUCK COULD YOU POSSIBLY HAVE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT?!""

He was frozen; his world, his dominion and sense of self-importance shattered like every chair he's ever tested, and presumably the glass dial of every scale he's carelessly punished. 

He didn't respond. He just stood there, fat and plump, like an engorged child, his blood pressure presumably spiking something fierce. 

""WELL? WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" I continued. He didn't respond, he just stood there, averting his eyes in the manner of a chastised child whose been scolded for stealing sweets. 

I tightly closed the door, not giving *it* another word, and went back to bed. 

.

Over the following weeks, what courage his indignation and fury might have mustered failed to appear... in person that is. 

Three weeks after our last encounter, I received a call. This time from our building's manager. When I answered, I could tell that the man at the other end of the line was making this call only with great reluctance. In short, he relayed to me that he'd received a number of noise complaints from our apartment, and he wanted to speak with me regarding the same. Before he continued, I asked him, politely, if he might tell me only the date and time of each, which he did, the rifling of papers audible beneath his sigh. He proceeded to list a dozen complaints, each of which I happily identified as having been made either while and my wife were at work, of, for a series of them, during a four day holiday we'd taken up north. 

That manager sighed, and muttered ""figures."" 

So I pushed him, asking whether these came from the bellowing, fat, man below. With the same sigh, he replied that indeed they had. So I pressed further, asking him whether this fellow made similar complaints of his neighbors. The manager declined to answer, citing confidentiality, and I, assured him that I understood. 

I closed the call, incensed to find out for myself. And to that end, that evening, after work I purchased a crate of Malbec, and, over the coming days, introduced myself to everyone who shared a wall, ceiling, or floor with this corpulent abomination. With each introductory bottle, I withdrew, usually with little hesitation, a slew of stories about our shared malignancy. 

I was case-building.

.

I should now note that, to make my living, I am an attorney. I am always reluctant to put that out there, because, in truth, must lawyers are utterly awful. They look to make fights from nothing, and so very often do not understand the value of compromise. But, for what it's worth, the skill set does lend well to the collection, aggregation, and sharpening of useful facts. 

And this is precisely what I did: I was unofficially taking the depositions of my new friends, inviting them for dinner and building friendships from the heavy ingot of shared hatred. 

.

And in this case-building I found that it was a bit more therapeutic than intended. I found myself laughing with each outrageous story, rather then getting more bitter than angry. Where I had intended to build a case, to prepare that venomous and stern letter, to whom I'd not yet determined, threatening the full force of the law should he continue to be such a nuisance, now I found myself just laughing at this lump of a man. 

.

And that has how it has, in most senses, ended. I hear him, from time to time, hammering away at one of my neighbors doors. The bitterness of years of fat-induced loneliness released each time his hammy, pudgy, fists connected with his target's door frame. I used to wonder which would give out first; the door before him, or the floor below. Now I simply shake my head and chuckle. 

He's never come to our door again, and I've tested the waters to the extreme (i'm currently on my second rebuilt motorcycle the living room directly above his.)

While I still see him waddling from the garage into the building, I try not to stare. I now can only see him with pity.

And he'll go on like this forever, I imagine. He's in his forties, perhaps fifties, so he's nearly done with his life. He's never any friends or acquaintances about. He avoids us like the plague, and he's just a sad, fat, child. 

So it is.










",What Bellows from Below.
fatpeoplestories,"On mobile so sorry for formatting and all that, first time poster. Part one of my tales of Dirty Ham. 

Be me: female, 5’8” and 120 lbs.
Don’t be: Dirty Ham, DH for short. 6’2 and 365 lbs with an incredible Fupa.

Upon meeting, DH seemed like a cool guy despite his weight and was very nice to me. 
However, it wasnt long before I found out how he really was. You see, once DH got comfortable around me he stopped caring. 

His house alone should have been marked a hazard. DH had an abundance of trash everywhere from rubber bands all over the floor to paper plates with food smeared on them and everything in between. Instead of throwing stuff away he’d toss it on the floor and leave it there for days to weeks at a time. 
DH refuses to clean his house, and if I said it was dirty he would tell me he didn’t see the dirt and I was dumb and seeing dirt that didn’t exist. 
His bathroom was dirty top to bottom and DH confessed to the occasional waffle stomp. The toilet covered in his feces inside that wouldn’t flush down. And the smell alone told you to stay outta there.
One day I walked in to find him dumping a gallon jug of urine. DH kept it next to his bed to pee in so he wouldn’t have to walk to the bathroom. He also used a same type gallon jug to mix tea in. He mixed up the two empty jugs, handed me one to make tea in saying he was sure that was the tea one. I threw them both out despite his whining. 

TL;DR: Dirty Ham is lazy and cant keep his house clean, mixes up two jugs he uses for tea and to pee in, expects me to make tea in either one.

fatpeoplestories,"So I've been going to the gym for a couple of years now. I've gone from a size XXL to a medium, and I'm the strongest I've ever been. However, I decided I needed to start running instead of lifting heavy things.

So I started Couch to 5k and started running. (Uuuuugh). 

During my walking cool down, I passed by 2 larger women, talking about weight loss and working up a sweat. They were talking about how motivated they were and how badly they wanted this.

I'm rooting for them! I hope they both meet their goals and stick with it. ",A Good Thing
fatpeoplestories,"So I was at a festival a few days ago, and this made me think of you guys.  Sadly I mostly lurk here and I can't post this with my main account for fear of my hammy friends actually ganging up on me and doing some damage to my petite, cute self!

So anyway, the festival.  LOTS of food and all that, expected to see a shit ton of hams and was not disappointed at all.  I went alone because sometimes introverted me wants to walk around without people being all ""peopley"" and shit.

So there was a tent where a huge bbq food truck had set up some shade for people to sit in and I'd gotten myself some food and was sitting down enjoying myself, listening to some live music playing on a close by stage.

I was not paying attention to the fat girl a few seats away from me, I have a lot of fat friends, they aren't all hams, though some are, (remind me one day to tell you about the more violent ones!) but at any rate, I wasn't judging her, her plate of food wasn't any more huge then mine, though it's possible she was going go back for 2nds, but whatever.

Anyway, she turns to me at some point and asks if I would mind going to find her a toothpick.  Well helpful me pointed out that they were at the stand where the napkins and condiments had been.  At first, I didn't consider that she meant for me to get up and get it for her, I just thought she didn't know their location.  

Well she huffed and said her feet hurt and she'd just deal with it.  A few minutes later she asked me one more time, and she actually looked a little uncomfortable.  So I repeated, I think she may have actually growled at me at this point.

I really did not intend to get her this damn toothpick though!

Anyway, I was done eating and decided to go off and explore again.  When I stood up and looked back at the ham she had pulled her greasy hair from the bun it had been in and was using that to floss her teeth, and then sucking off of her hair what came out of her teeth!

She'd rather be that disgusting than walk a few feet to get herself an actual toothpick!!

I guess if you're nice I'll come back to write more and all that jazz :)","lazy, hair floss ham"
fatpeoplestories,"
Hello my sweet beautiful sunflowers. Today I tell you a tale of the one, the only, FannyPackHam (FPH). When I lived with my ex, as my most recent story outlines, our neighbors were two gay (holla) dudes, young ham (YH) and old ham (OH) - there was around a 20 year difference between them. However, they not only had *the gay*, but they were polyamorous as well. 

This is where FPH comes in. He was one of their poly...friends? I hesitate because FPH was just so...FPH that I can’t use the term “lovers”. 

*shudder*

FPH was of remarkable build, and by remarkable I mean something out of childhood nightmares. He was probably around 5’4”, but his stomach extended so far out that it was a wonder he could keep himself standing upright. Like an isosceles triangle on its side, the beer belly of lore. And what was proudly displayed 24/7 upon his prominent belly tub? You guessed it, a fannypack, in alllllll its moldy and faded black-ish glory. 

What was in said pack of fannies? I never knew and hope to never find out. 

Another quirk of his corporeal form was his mouth. I think there’s a cartoon character that looks somewhat like it, but it’s escaping me, so if any of you figure it out from my description you will be showered with love and affection. Normal human teeth generally angle straight down, i.e. actually I don’t fucking know, I had braces for like a century - just think of some smiley model with her perf pearly whites. 

FPH’s angled out at about a 30 degree angle. So when his mouth was closed, it always looked like he was being some middle schooler with an orange slice hidden in his mouth, preparing to go “hawhawhawwwww u guys look I gots orange teef.”  However, combined with his pre-pubescent Justin Bieber stash, this was a hellacious sight to behold. 

PS I’m outside and a squirrel just tried to jump from the telephone wire to the tree, missed big time, bellyflopped on the lawn, then did some weird chittery thing at me before scampering away. Rude. 

During my time living at the apartment, YH and OH were generally friendly to me, YH overly and unwelcomely so, and FPH only had waved whenever he was around their place. I had never actually heard him speak until a fateful 6am December morning, when I was in the driver’s seat of my car waiting for its to warm up enough to turn the heat and seat warmer on. 

Dunno if you guys are morning people, but I weirdly am and I wake up so energized it’s like I snorted some coke in my sleep. I bounce around, talk with the cats, chatter to myself, and otherwise amble around happily like the people you probably hate most at work (AW NOOOO, SOMEONE’S GOT A CASE OF THE MONDAAYYYS - thankfully I’ve never actually said this, otherwise I wouldn’t have let myself live to tell you this story). I also am extremely jumpy during this period of time, this all lasts about an hour until I sink back into the somber monotony of hating myself, my life, and everyone around me except my catties. 

*Knock knock* on my window. 

I register the knocks, turn towards my window, and almost eject myself out of the sunroof with the force of an F-16 engine. FPH and his 4 haired mustache are less than an inch away from my window. Repressing the urge to open the door quickly, and subsequently into his offending-my-morning-zen-space face, I crack the window and lock the doors, disregarding the fact that my lunch is still inside and prepare to erect fortifications against the menace that would make a Roman Legionnaire salivate. 

“Hello. What?” I say, eloquent as always. His response almost doesn’t register, as it’s so high pitched that it’s a few wavelengths below a dog whistle. 

“Hey sweetie, just wanted to say have a good day at work.”

FULL STOP

I don’t take kindly to pet names, least of all from this Ham that I’ve never actually spoken to once and could have a nuke hidden in his fannypack, or an immigrant family ready to take my jobs!!!!!111!!!!!

He keeps grinning at me so eerily that I subconsciously start to think what he would look like wearing my skin. Amidst those pleasant thoughts, I gurgle out “gggguuygshajamhKjshsnajaknshdbmmmyeahthanksbye”, slam the car into reverse, and floor it out of there. 

JK. It’s December in Ohio, meaning it’s either snowing or has been sleet-raining with unrelenting force (FUS-RO-DAHELLAWAYFROMME). Our garage area was in a little turnaround, so I had approximately 6 feet before backing into muck and slush. Guess what I did?! JUST THAT. 

Thank the feline lord above for all wheel drive, as I again floored it, tires spun around for a sec, then zoomed off into the sunset (sunrise lol my life sucks), while FPH leered at me mockingly from afar while winking repeatedly (disclaimer: not sure if he was winking or has problem).

Every time I saw FPH after, he’d put in intense effort to make eye contact, but I’m well versed in starting at my feet like they’re telling me the secrets to the universe. Thankfully, I only saw him *hiss* a few times after the incident, and then never did again. 

**Epilogue:** A few months later, OH and I get to talking, and I mentioned that I hadn’t seen FPH in a while. He then drops this bombshell: OH found out that FPH would “host” specifically interracial gangbangs at the HamApartment, which he neither lived in nor owned any part of, while YH and OH were off doing whatever the fuck they did during the day. He did this for cash, as he was apparently neck deep in gambling debt. To top it all off, one day while OH/YH were again, off doing whatever, he stole all their electronics and any cash laying around, and proceeded to disappear off the face of the earth. 

Took a while for the scratches on my chin to heal since it HIT THE FUCKING PAVEMENT after hearing of FPH’s sexploits. I had thought to assist them with making a police report and profile of FPH, but prudently decided that “inverted isosceles triangle with Justin Bieber circa ‘One Less Lonely Girl’ mustache” wouldn’t do that much good. 

Ah, love. Ah, polyamory. Ah, gangbangs for money. The world is yours for the taking, or for someone to take you - for cash of course (ba dum tiss). 

Til next time my loves!

fatpeoplestories,"Today, I was flying on a small domestic airline in an Asian country. The guy next to me was HUGE. Not Asian huge, which is a HAES “small fat”; he was actually morbidly obese. Fortunately, he was seated next to his very petite mom so he could spill over into her seat and didn’t spill too much into mine. 

Anyway, the stewardess was doing the cabin check before we took off, stopped at our row and told the guy, “Sir, can you please put your seat back upright for take off?”

The guy sat up and his seat immediately sprung upright. As soon as he leaned back, the seat leaned backwards again. 

“Sir,” the stewardess’ smile grew slightly tight, “Please keep the seat *fully* upright for take off.”

I figured out what was going on immediately and was trying to figure out how to mime the situation out to the poor woman. 

The guy leaned forward again. The seat sprung upright again. He leaned back again and the seat creaked back again. 

The stewardess couldn’t keep her forced friendly tone anymore and you can hear a tinge or irritation in her voice, “Sir, you can lean your seat backwards after we take off. For now, please keep it *fully* upright.”

I guess she had never seen someone so huge, so she didn’t realise that someone can be heavy enough to cause the seat to lean backward, even in an upright position. She thought he was just being a dick and taunting her by repeatedly leaning his seat back by a tiny fraction after pretending to comply with her order to put his seat back upright. 

It took a few more uncomfortable repetitions of the scenario before it finally clicked and she realised what was happening. She flushed hard, mumbled an apology and continued with the cabin check as fast as she could. 

The poor woman avoided making eye contact with our entire row for the rest of the flight.

* character intros

* lack of character intros

* nicknames

* lack of nicknames

* ""be me""

* lack of ""be me""

* greentext

* no greentext

In other words, opinion is divided, so just go with whatever you prefer when writing, k. 

Here are some things that genuinely mess up a story:

* using only initials for characters - this gets confusing. ""N said to M and then M said to P and then F heard that I (meaning my friend I, not I myself) was being fatphobic but I said (again, my friend I, not myself) that 'J was just messing with K and T but S was super pissed off and F ate the whole thing! anyway it was just a random thing, guys, but I laughed (meaning me this time) lol' it was totes funny guys""

Don't be a dick. [Constructive criticism](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/constructive--criticism) is great! But don't be hostile or rude. We've been seeing a lot of hostility lately, and we mods are going to start cracking down on this even harder.

fatpeoplestories,"Our relationship lasted from 2013-2015. I'm almost 5'10, and at the time weighed around 120lb, I was very slim. My ex was around 5'4, and she was at least a hundred pounds heavier than me. I'll call her Abi. 

Abi was from a VERY well off family. She'd attended private school in London her entire life, and was pretty sheltered and spoiled. However, she also had insane body confidence issues, and I believe dating a slim girl didn't help. However, small jabs such as her saying she didn't enjoy my hip bones ( and went as far as buying me a high-waisted bikini to hide my stomach and hips ), or that I was tiiiiny, soon escalated to full on aggression, lying, and full on batshit behaviour.

Her family were big fans of the traditional British roast dinner. I lived with them for a while, and her mum was a fantastic cook, and I pretty much gobbled whatever she made - cause it was always GOOD. However, my ex started doing something strange. As I spooned out my portions from the serving dish onto my plate, she'd knock some of the food off of the spoon, leaving me with much less than I'd planned. I dimissed it, who knows how I could justify that, but I did. 

She would often accuse me of purging my food. So convinced of my supposed eating disorder, she would try to prevent me from going to the bathroom directly after meals.

Like I said, little things escalated. She never wanted me to wear tight or revealing clothes. It became routine that before we went out, she'd put another layer on me, hiding my figure, or flat out ask me to change my clothes. It was clear that she could not tolerate any visual indications that I was slim. The bikini incident is another example of this, and the beach she bought me the bikini for? She ended up urging me to wear a surfing shirt anyway. 

I should stress, I really think Abi had nightly binges. During the day she'd eat perfectly acceptable portions of very healthy food, but I often woke up to hear her on the stairs. Our diets and lifestyles considered, she should have been slimmer than me. But she was much, much bigger. Her having designated binge food will come into play.

One day, I had returned to the house after a long walk. I was starving, and dug through the freezer for an easy meal. I popped some chicken coujons in the oven, and started toasting some sourdough for a sandwich. In comes Abi.

She asks what I'm cooking, and when I tell her it was the coujons, she freaks out. She tells me that she's in the middle of cleaning the oven, and the chemical cleaner in the oven would contaminate the food, and I would Quite. Literally. Die. if I ate them. I couldn't smell the cleaner, but - Shit! I took them out the oven immediately to toss them, turning the oven off. But Abi stopped me, told me to go chill, and she'd clean up.

I come back in later to make tea. There is Abi, hunched over a bottle of mayonnaise, and my beloved coujons are nothing but crumbs and scraps now. Immediately I'm freaked out, and instances of her food aggression pop into my head, so I just make my tea in a casual manner and leave, saying nothing about the supposedly highly toxic coujons.

 I've never dated someone around my size. Even my current gf has a BMI of around 25, while mine is 20. Its honestly due to chance rather than preference, and honestly, I much prefer slim girls, but you love who you love.

I have definitely noticed this pattern of attempted sabotage among fat gay women. Whether it was Abi forcing me to dress in an unflattering manner to save her own confidence, forcing me to eat tiny portions, or my other ex Kit mocking me for the amount I ate ( she was at least 40lb heavier than me ), it's definitely a thing. My current gf adores my body and makes me feel wonderful.

I'm honestly too scared to talk to other gay girls about this since the LGBT community as a whole tends to be very bahdee pozzeteev and I would no doubt be called a fat shamer and a bigot.

TLDR; My fat ex tried to control my portions to the extreme, forced me to hide my slim frame, had mad food aggression, and accused me of having bulimia.
",My Fat Ex
fatpeoplestories,"If you don't get the title, when things are crazy as shit in the medical field, we joke that there must be a full moon driving everybody mad. We've got a full moon hanging over the unit where I work, but it's not the pretty one in the sky. It's feckin Hilde (not her real name). The fat, slow, bordering on useless CNA I was stuck with tonight. I'm mostly here to vent, so I apologize if this isn't the most entertaining story you've ever read. If I ignored all the other reasons I have to dislike what being obese does to people, this woman alone would still make me hate it.

I'm a certified nurse's aide. We basically do the grunt work of nursing; completing simple, but laborious tasks like checking vitals, patient transfers, getting them dressed and showered, etc. It becomes a complicated job when you have to balance those tasks for 7-14 patients at a time, in between therapy, meals, family visits, and of course their medical needs. My floor is dedicated to physical rehabilitation for recovering patients. It's pretty much just the elderly. Lots of total knees, total hips, back surgeries and that ilk. Rehab gets very busy, because it means getting back to their normal life. We get them up and dressed in the morning, too and from meals and activities, into the shower regularly, and then into bed later. It is an extremely intense job environment, but it doesn't always have to be a nuthouse. Especially when the floor only has just over half the beds full, like it does right now.

My night tonight was already fucking bonkers because the not-planetary bodied CNA working the day shift that crossed over half my 8 hour evening shift was a lazy shit. She kept walking off the floor to do nothing, ignoring her own lights, sitting down and charting when other lights were going off, and I babysat the whole damned floor during dinner. It sucked, and then entered Hilde to relieve her. 

Hilde, the full, hammy moon herself must weigh close to 300lbs at about 5'1. Her scrubs are XXXL on the top, I have no idea what size bottoms she wears but they squeeze her 'waist' into what must be a world record muffin top. She has a poofy bob cut to chin length, and her face is constantly covered in red, greasy acne. It's concentrated almost exclusively around her mouth, I wonder why. She doesn't smell, thankfully, but she is a heavy sweater. Hilde has been a nurse's aide for about 20 years, I give her credit for her experience, shame she hasn't fucking learned anything from it. Hilde waddles in at the beginning of her 6:30pm-6:30am night shift already winded, and munching on god knows what that she plated in the kitchen from the leftovers. Her first trip any time she comes on shift is always to the kitchen, to see what remains of the dinner specials she can have. She has this on top of the massive marshmucks coffee she always has in her hand, to ""Wake me up since it's so hard to have to sleep during the day!"", and whatever she ate for her breakfast at home. 

I've already been working from 2:30pm by the time she's arrived, and I'm thoroughly pissed that my other coworker left me to bust my ass all afternoon. I'm no fit princess myself, I'm overweight by about 45-50lbs and working on losing, down 7lbs now. I get in almost the full 8 hours I'm on shift in fast paced walking, lifting heavy patients, maneuvering wheelchairs and lifts, which has helped a lot. I get around just fine in my line of work, I'm even considered relatively strong. Hilde never walks anywhere with any obvious haste; she's too busy waddling her slow, giant ass up and down the hallways because she probably can't move any faster. Her attempt at walking quickly up the hallway is still slower than my comfortable walking pace. And she never seems to think even the busiest nights deserve any urgency, she takes frequent opportunities to sit, snack, chart and do everything to avoid answering call lights. In just three hours tonight, I watched her take a bar or crackers to eat from the nourishment room three times, and went and got a small employee coffee after polishing off her venti marshmucks.

As the evening goes on and more patients go to sleep and we can relax a bit. If we're sitting down to chart or something and one of her group's lights goes off, she will look to me or other 8 hour evening staff and ask us to go see what they need because "" I'm sorry but I'm seriously just so exhausted, this is the first I'm I've sat down since I got here"". This started at 8:00 tonight. BITCH you've been here for TWO HOURS. I've been here for 6. You're already that fucking tired? I don't know how she gets by in our line of work if she's exhausted and shocked that she hasn't found time to sit in the first two hours of her shift. I've gone my entire 8 hour shift with no sitting before, and still been up for an evening walk when I got home, and yet within 2 hours this woman is routinely visibly red, sweating, and snorking with effort.

Tonight, it seemed like her goal was to let me and my skinnybeast coworker take care of all her patients tonight. Every time I left a room for what must have been at least an hour that I was sure about, I looked at her group of rooms and the EXACT same few lights would still be on, waiting. We are expected to help each other out all night, our group is our focus but all patients are all CNAs responsibilities. She was so exhausted having to hulk her own weight around that just putting one patient to bed was taking her 30+ minutes each, for patients that are not labor intensive. I watched her from one room across the hall, a patient that is a supervision transfer took her 25 minutes to get into the bathroom to brush teeth, out and then into bed. She didn't even have to dress this woman, but just pushing her wheelchair around, turning down the sheets on the bed, and standing by to make sure she transferred safely had her huffing and puffing. One patient asked for a heated blanket for his feet, which she said she'd get, only to ask me to go get it from the unit the heater is on because ""my feet seriously hurt tonight and I don't want to walk that far"". The other unit and the blanket warmer were 100 feet away. No I'm not getting the fucking blanket for you.

She will also beg for help doing tasks that should only take one CNA to perform. I'm fine with asking for help from your fellow employee, but there's a point where it's just being a lazy shit. She will call us in to change a patient who is perfectly capable of bridging in bed and pulling their own pants up; ""They're just so haaard to roooll"". She will call me in to 'help' her transfer a patient who is a limited one-person assist, meaning I'm doing literally all the work while she stands there and watches, breathing heavily. If it's a two person lift, this woman who can somehow manage to drag her own massive weight around can provide almost no lift to the patient, so it is basically a one person lift with her standing there with her hands on the patient. Are you really that damned weak Hilde?! Or do you just not want to work anymore? Sorry, my spine isn't worth your crap.

At 10:25, when I'm supposed to be giving bedside handoff report and going home, one more call light goes off, for one of her patients. Said patient is a big lady, a strong one person assist but only a one person lift (which means \*GASP\*, lifting) who is ready to get off the pot in the bathroom and back into bed. Hilde sighs the biggest fucking sigh she can manage through her heavy, snorting breaths, and looks at me. ""sipsredpepper, can you please go get her, I'm seriously burned out tonight I just can't answer her anymore"". This patient called only three times tonight. ""Hilde, no, I've been here for 8 hours, I need to leave on time tonight. I will give you report but you need to answer this light or you need to ask \[other coworker\]"". ""Oh my gosh, \*sorry\*. Didn't know you were sooooo tired."" Like I'm lazy.

On a floor with the number of patients we had, this night did not have to be as back breakingly busy as it was. Even when the floor is kinda crazy, if we are all working our hardest and trying to support each other, we all get breaks, we all leave on time. I dread whenever I see Hilde's name on shift because I know she is going to snack and sit her way through our night. Thanks for listening to my aimless, boring rant. I'm just so sick of lazy CNAs, but I'm even more sick of CNAs who are lazy because they are physically unfit for their job description. It doesn't take a Marine body to be a nurses aide, but you can't be a fallen fucking star. It's about as helpful as a no call no show, and we as your coworkers, and your patients do not deserve that.","There's a full moon tonight, but it's not in the sky [Long]"
fatpeoplestories,"So we probably all live one life. Imagine treating yourself to an unhealthy day once a week. The other 6 days you have a balanced diet. Then at the end you die. You've eaten healthy for the most part of your life with a near perfect body, but it's now over.

Then you've got someone who eats what they want. Doesn't spend time wasting it in the gym. Sleeps when they want. Wakes up when they want. Definitely spends less than the healthy person does on food and gym memberships. But probably lives a shorter life span with health issues and then the unhealthy person dies. 

These comparisons make me feel that living an unhealthy life is more enjoyable than a healthy life albeit at a cost.

PS. I'm on a diet at the moment. I weigh 245lbs now which I've dropped from 255lbs in a few weeks. I feel so meh because I feel like I'm restricted. I work nights at a petrol station and I'm literally alone for like 5 hours of the night with all the chocolate you could want staring at me in the face and I'm really considering breaking this diet.

fatpeoplestories,Help me out here please. I have been heavy my whole life with the exception of this last two years. I went from 334 now down to 187. I just got tired of be tired so I stopped eating. I now eat one very small meal a day. And it's been two years and never going back. People who know me and haven't seen me lately always make this big deal about how skinny I am. And everyone tells me I am not fat any more. I know I have lost some weight but I can't see it. All I see in the mirror is the same fat guy I have always been. Only noticable thing to me is feeling better and my clothes. Went from 2xl to medium shirts. Now I haven't wore medium shirts since kindergarten so I know I am smaller. But I just can't tell visually why?,All I see is a fat guy!
fatpeoplestories,"I have a friend who's overweight and almost obese. I myself am in relatively good shape. I exercise and pay attention to my nutrition. 

Now, my friend has a habit of giving people nutritional advice. His advice is generally true but looking at the person, it's clear that he doesn't follow his own advice. To his credit, my diet improved tremendously due to his advice. My meals now consist of mostly red rice, veggies, and an assortment of fish. With some milk every few days. 

However, the issue with my friend is that he gives this advice in the most condescending way possible. The only reason I followed his advice at all, was due to us being close for years. Here's a taste of his advice, ""Eww, disgusting don't you know you shouldn't eat (insert junk food), you should eat (insert healthy food)  instead. 

One time, I confronted him about this and he replied,"" You don't understand, people need to know what to eat, they don't know any better. ""
I followed up by asking him about why he didn't follow his own diet advice for once. His reply was...  not suprising,"" Oh, my genetics are absolutely terrible, no matter how much I eat I will never lose much weight. ""

I knew for a fact that this was bullshit, because I too used to be about the same weight as him. After following his diet plan for 2 months plus exercise, I got down to a healthy weight. Not only that, I noticed that he would somehow eat snacks at every opportunity(something he forbade me from doing). This wouldn't be an issue if the snacks were healthy, but I don't think a full on big mac and taco bell should be considered snacks at all. Yes, he calls big macs snacks as long as he eats it outside breakfast, lunch, or dinner. He thinks that just because he ate something outside of normal meal times the calories will magically dissappear.

fatpeoplestories,"Just a short one I witnessed not too long ago

I work at a place that among other things rents out a few vintage cars to customers. Cars from the 50s to the 70s, Karmann Ghias, Beetles, Minis, Adenauer Benz,Ford Capri, nothing too fancy.

Now there was a couple celebrating their 30th-somethings anniversary, and for that they wanted to go on tour for a day in the car the man had when they first met, a Citroën Dyane, which is a sorta ""luxury"" 2CV. As it is with old cars like that we go through some details like ""do you know how to operate a car that old, what is your driving exprience, do you even fit"" (2 meter tall and a Mini rarely mixes well). In this case as the guy once had the same car for over a decade, it was all checked off rather too soon and instructions were also just scheduled for that same day as they were coming from over 2 hours away.

Well, big day comes, and surprise, renter would still fit in terms of height, but has belly and thights that securly lodge the steering wheel [(see here)](http://www.citroenorigins.de/sites/default/files/styles/1600/public/dyane_6_1974_interieur.jpg?itok=UHbxbi8x) in place. Also with both man and woman in the car, as she is almost as big, the doors won't close without force. Behind their backs we also highly doubt the 32 hp the car has would be enough to carry them up any steep road we have around here. Add to that 25+°C temparatures and no AC.

In the end they had to chancel the small Citroën and were also too embarassed to take the offer of another ""bigger"" car (a Chevy Corvair, go figur). Hopefully it was a wakeup call.",Dyane in a small car
fatpeoplestories,"A very good day to all of you sugah addicts, Athena is back to satisfy your intense cravings !

Quick recap of characters:

Me, 26 F, Then 154 lbs at 5'5 (I now weigh 141 lbs, yay!)

Bestie Nivea, 25 F, about 125 lbs at 5'4

Athena, F, easily 250-260 lbs at about 5'2

Mama Athena, immaculately dressed, 'society laydie', about 5'3 and 150 lbs

Here's &gt; [Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/8w9a17/i_am_fighting_fit_she_says_250_lbs_she_weighs/)   

and 

&gt; [Part Two] (https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/8y9t0u/i_am_fighting_fit_she_saysathena_part_2/) for reference!

**""That's her! That's the bitch who called me a Green Snorlax!""** screamed Athena, pointing towards me furiously.

Allofmywut.jpg

I just gawked at her, and Nivea being Nivea, started to chortle all over again. **SNORLAXXXX….HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, that's just perfect!""** and she doubled over before Athena started to march towards me, her mother in tow.

""What the fuck, when did I ever call you that?"" I asked, all the while looking daggers at Nivea who was still cackling like the idiot goose she is.

The club staff, which included the receptionist, a member of the management and one of the pool attendants also came over to us.

""My goodness, the language!"" Mama Athena said, following this with a gasp and a fake hand-flutter to the face. ""You see?"" she then looked towards the club staff, ""this is how she talks even when elders are present. My daughter is but the same age as her. Do you still doubt she said all those mean things to her?"" 

Before I could speak up, Mama Athena followed this up with ""And look at the other one, she is laughing so shamelessly! I did not know this club condones bullying like this. Just wait and watch, I will make this issue public. I have friends in high places!""

Some context here: in India, it is considered blasphemy to use swear words in front of our ""elders"", no matter how uncouth they themselves might be, and the statement ""having friends in high places"" is tossed about with regularity, and often little truth.

Also Mama Athena seemed to be fine with her daughter using the word ""bitch"" in her presence, but I digress...

""I said absolutely no such thing to her. In fact, she was the one who was picking on me. She even tried to jump on top of me in the pool and called me fat several times. Your daughter is the bully, not me"" I said as calmly as I could. Nivea had quieted down by this time and began to say ""Yes, there are witnesses to all this and she even threw...""
 
Mama Athena interrupted **""SHUT UP!** No one is talking to you! You probably egged on my daughter even more, skinny little matchstick that you are. You think you are so perfect. At least my daughter is making a commitment to getting fitter. She is a national level swimming champion!"" and then she looked at me and said ""girls like you should understand what it feels like to be fat and bullied by random people. What made you think it was okay to bully her just because you are a few kilos lighter?""

For those of you have been following this since Part One, you may remember that Athena had claimed to be a state-level champion. Now her mom says national champion. Hmmmmm…
 
As for ""a few kilos lighter""...Athena was easily 100lbs heavier than me, if not more. At this statement, Nivea burst out laughing once again. I even saw the club staff suppress their sniggers.

""Hey, **SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU TWIG!** Are you mental? You were laughing in the pool, laughing in the shower room, you are laughing even now. Go home and puke a little, some of that laughter will subside. That's probably what you do after every meal"" This from the beast herself.

Nivea looked her straight in the eye for a long moment. No one said anything. Then she did the same fake-fluttering hand to her face and said ""My goodness, the language!"" in a superb imitation of Mama Athena.

I couldn't help laughing after this and neither could the club staff. The receptionist quickly regained her composure and said 'Madam, this is not true. Your daughter created a big scene at the pool, I can even show you..."" before Mama Athena interrupted yet again

""**NOT ANOTHER WORD!** All of you are fat shamers here. Such a well known club, and so much discrimination! Just you wait and watch. I will write about this on Twitter and Facebook. I have journalist friends. Just wait, I will show all of you!"" while wagging her finger in the receptionist's face.

This commotion had attracted a fair bit of crowd. Some of this comprised the kids Athena had attempted to chase down around the pool. They were giggling and pointing. Athena turned to them with a look of black thunder on her face. It almost seemed like she would launch herself at them again, before deciding against it. Her face just puffed up into a red, red balloon. 

Then one of the kids piped up ""Hey she just looks like that Aunt Marge!"" in a very audible voice and he and his friend started laughing shamelessly loud.

For those who don't get the context, he was referring to Aunt Marge in Harry Potter. I must say, the resemblance was startling. Athena really did look like a younger version of her, with dark hair.

This was too much for them. Athena burst out into big, obviously fake, gulping sobs while Mama screamed at the kids and shooed them away. They were laughing so hard they could barely run a few metres ahead before stopping to catch their breath.

Athena then advanced towards me and started to shove me again, panting hard, uttering profanities, her face a hot mess This time, however, I was prepared and held both her hands in a strong grip, pushing her away from me. Athena then pretended to trip and stumbled over to the floor, wailing and flailing her limbs about.

**""OH COME ON! Stop overreacting!** Nivea rolled her eyes.

Mama Athena had had enough. She abused me, Nivea, the club staff, and started with her threats again, only this time, she also said she would go to the police and report all of us for assault. 

""You do that madam"", the receptionist said. But before that, you need to see something. Follow me"" in a flat, no-nonsense voice.

Mama Athena had by then helped the beast back to her feet and grudgingly followed the receptionist, all the while muttering profanities and threats. Athena continued to fake cry. Nivea and I followed at a safe distance.

The receptionist disappeared inside the club for a while after asking us to wait in the lobby. She came out about five minutes later, a security officer in tow. The guy then showed us CCTV footage of the pool area. Of course! Why hadn't we thought of this?

The CCTV cameras were places on a not-so-easily-visible eave with a full view of the pool. All of Athena's actions were recorded on it.

You guys, I have never once seen the colour drain out from a person's face that fast. Or someone stop crying so abruptly!
 
""Now please go ahead and make all those complaints you were threatening to. Yeah, post it on social media too. We, naturally, will provide our side of the story as well. You can see we have clear proof"" the receptionist said, giving Mama Athena a death stare.

""Come, let's go away from here. They obviously provoked you but how can one tell from the CCTVs, right? I know how it is. All these skinny bitches think they can treat everyone like crap. Let's leave right now"" Mama Athena said, glaring at all of us and hustling her daughter out of the lobby.

""**YOUR POOL IS REALLY SHITTY ANYWAY**"" Athena fired a parting shot. 

""Well, great that you don't have to come back here ever again then. You are banned."" The receptionist said. Nivea gave her a syrupy sweet smile and waved at her. Athena showed her the finger before getting out the gates.

                                                             **THE END**


","""I am fighting fit..."" she says. Athena Part 3"
fatpeoplestories,"I'm back! It's been two years since my last tale but boy have I got some new ones to tell. Some of you older subscribers may remember my tales from far flung exotic places (and Phoenix) but this treacly tale comes from much closer to home.

I work in an office. A boring standard office with an awful lot of boring standard office types. Things moved along day by day without a hitch and things were pleasant and uneventful. Then things changed.

Character List:

Me: Now pushing into my late 20s but fortunately my BMI has not. Office worker, beer drinker, calorie counter and champion of sacrasm.
Old Boss Man: My old boss, standard bloke.
Drones: I won't give the rest of the people names, that would give them too much personality.
Ethelred: The antagonist of our story, rougly 5""6 and weighs around 280lbs at the start of our story.

I was always aware of Ethelred even since I started working at the company. There were fleeting glances and overheard voices that hinted towards his true nature but from the start but I thought he seemed pleasant enough, even if he did have a sweat on during the deep depths of winter. We didn't interact frequently as he works in a different team in a different room of the building but our departments work quite closely together.

My old boss had decided to retire quite quickly after I started and since he had worked there for over 30 years, large celebrations were planned. The management had decided that we would be having a party in the office and the working day would be cut short to accomodate. The day of the party arrives and there is plenty of cakes, pizzas and other treats laid out on communal tables in our open plan office.  

Management had prepared a short 5-10 minute presentation as a thank you and a send off and we all vacated the room with the food to attend, when we returned however, there was noticably less food on the table than when we left. Ethelred, who was noticeably absent from the presentation, walked into the room with two oily used plates. The unmistakeable evidence of pizza/indian savory pastries. 

Drone 1: ""Ethelred, has anyone else been in here and helped themselves?""

Ethelred: ""Dunno, how should I know?""

Drone 1: ""Were you not in here when we were watching the presentation?""

Ethelred: ""No, I took some food and was eating at my desk. I have a LOT of work to do, I don't have time to stop and chat""

Old Boss: ""Cheers""

Ethelred wasn't lying, he had been pulled up on some missed deadlines and told he had to get it done by the end of the week, as the day was Friday, clearly he hadn't caught up yet and would be there past 5.

A couple of weeks pass and there is a noticeable smell as well as an abundance of flies in my departments kitchen. It comes to a head when maggots crawl from underneath one of the cabinets and everyone starts to investigate what the hell has gone on.

Disgusted and using the handle of a broom, one of the drones nurses out rotten bits of the party food lightly wrapped up in tissue paper from underneath kitchen cupboards and the fridges. Initally everyone thought it must be accidental but Ethelred shot himself in the foot.

He confided in a close 'friend' that because he was working late that night and annoyed, he had taken food from the party, wrapped it up, put it on the floor and nudged it underneath places in the kitchen using his foot to collect later but he was too fat to bend down and get all of it out once everyone had gone home. So he just left it there to rot. 

I don't know if he was ever reprimanded but if he was, I would have loved to see that conversation.

Stay tuned for Part 2.",I'm back! A Brit Abroad with a new saga from these proud Isles. Part 1 - The Introduction
fatpeoplestories,"I been reading up on the whole Healthy At Every Size theory and how people believe size isn't an indicator of fitness, and I have a story that totally debunks this. Sure, it's anecdotal blablabla, but I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who has experienced firsthand how BS that whole theory is. 

So a big misconception out there is that most beauty bloggers are stunningly gorgeous creatures. Beauty bloggers tend come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and the reason is that people like seeing dramatic transformation and feeling like they too can be pretty with makeup. 

The beauty bloggers with a more fashion/lifestyle oriented sort of content tend to be stunning, because well....people of all sizes prefer seeing clothes on skinny people. Sure, there are plus size fashion/lifestyle bloggers, but they typically fill a niche market, and the big (figuratively) mainstream fashion/lifestyle bloggers are very rarely fat. 

The beauty bloggers with more beauty related content though, are not necessarily stereotypically pretty. You have people with severe acne, ""older"" women (ie. late 20s-early 30s), men, and yes...larger women. In a typical beauty blogger gathering, I estimate around 10% are overweight with even a couple of men or women who are clearly obese. 


So with that in mind, let me tell you about the time a brand decided on the dumbest PR party ever.

This was a makeup brand and they partnered with a gym to invite a bunch of beauty &amp; fashion bloggers for a party &amp; a Zumba class. I got invited too, since I do have some beauty related content. 

As soon as I arrived, I can already hear Marshmallow's blaring voice. 

I'm calling her Marshmallow because she's one of those girls who gives herself cutesy nicknames and tries really hard to make them stick. She also loves acting in an overly cutesy little girl way....that unfortunately, comes off as just grating and kind of sad since she's in her 20s but looks over 30 in real life. Probably because she looks like a melting marshmallow everywhere, including her face. 

She typically edits the fuck out of her pictures though, so her Instagram profile is looks hilarious as you can see her expand in videos where she couldn't edit her face, and shrink in pictures where she goes ham with photoshopping. 

Marshmallow, is loud as usual, but she's still trying to do her cutesy voice, so she sounds like a foghorn on helium. 

""OHMYGAWD I'm SOOOO. EXCITED! Are we all ready to WORK OUT?"" she blared. 

Marshmallow is acting as if the event was all about meeting her, even though there were loads of heavyweights at this event. I was definitely feeling kind of star struck and wondering how the hell I ended up there.

Marshmallow has about 28k subscribers on YouTube &amp; 11k followers on Instagram, and I suspect everything was bought. I've never heard about her before I started getting invited to all these beauty events, and I've definitely heard of smaller bloggers than her. I think she's just good at sucking up to brand managers who are too lazy to check if your followers are legit, and that's how she keeps snagging invites to all the events. 

Before the event even started, you can already tell what a bad idea a Zumba class for a bunch of beauty bloggers would be. Quite a lot of people had full glam makeup on. 

At first, I thought they may know some makeup magic I didn't know about, that lets them sweat buckets and still look glamorous. I was definitely freaking out about how I'm going to look good on camera (false lashes are a must), while still keeping everything sweat proof. 

Turns out, a bunch of people didn't get the memo about the event including working out. As in they got it, but they didn't *get* it. There were loads of panicked cries of, ""Wait, we're actually going to work out?!"" after the photos were taken.

Apparently, they were under the impression that it was a sports themed  party where they get to show off their cute work out gear and that was it. I think many people would've left, if the brand didn't mention that, since the gym hosting the Zumba class was also sponsoring the event, you either join in the work out and be in the gym's promotional video, or walk away without the VERY generous goodie bags. 


A few people were very upset, and I can understand why. I was actually surprised to find out after attending all these events just how bad a lot of beauty bloggers' skins are. I mean, even if you see their bare faces on their YouTube videos, it doesn't look as bad as it does in real life. So yes, there were tons of caked on makeup galore, and it doesn't look as good in real life. Some people literally had cracking faces. Their photos look stunning though.


The brand was smart enough to take the photos pre-workout, before everyone's faces melted off. 

Anyway, as soon as the even started, you immediately can see that all the claims about not being able to tell someone's fitness level by their size is delusional.

The first 5 min, the larger girls were definitely dancing more enthusiastically, ""woooo!""ing the loudest, and taking the most selfies/videos. 

One thing I noticed about most influencers is that quite a lot of the really pretty ones are actually slightly guarded and self-conscious. I tend to be drawn to the non-stereotypically pretty ones (older/larger/ethnic features/very muscular/darker skinned/etc.) because they tend to be the fun, confident ones. Well, you have to be extremely confident to put yourself out there when you're not stereotypically ""pretty"". Hell, I know I have to have Kevlar thick skin, because I get a LOT of racist or just plain mean comments on my account. That's what happens when you're known for a very ethnic feature...loads of people are dying to tell you how ugly that ethnic feature is, and how you need plastic surgery to correct that shit ASAP. 

Ironically, sometimes the comments come from really gross, flabby dudes who seem to have serious hygiene issues. Do they really think I'd go, ""Oh snap! Thank you for pointing out I need plastic surgery! Teach me how to be an greasy, acne-riddled, flabby slob like you, senpai!""

Credit to where credit's due, the #effyourbeautystandards crowd is really quick to tell these racists to shut the fuck up. Anyway, back to the story...

Marshmallow is doing her best to attract the film crew's attention with what I assume she thought were hot, seductive moves...but just looks like what I imagine a dugong out of the water having a seizure would look like. The film crew were carefully avoiding her, and I noticed through some strategic rearrangement, they got all the hottest women in one area and were mostly just filming them. Every now and then, they would film the loud, larger women, but I suspect they did that just to placate them and avoid getting murdered in an angry stampede.

Despite all the enthusiasm though, you can already see that the larger girls are doing things wrong. You notice the fitter girls,were definitely lifting their legs higher and making more controlled movements. The kind of controlled movements that actually uses your muscles instead of the momentum of your body weight and hoping your joints can take it. 

Based on that, I estimate that the fitter girls are already using up nearly twice the calories of the girls who are just thrashing about. 

Past 5 min, most of the larger girls are listlessly flopping around. Gone were the enthusiastic, frenzied thrashing. The gym's film crew have stopped filming, because it just looks sad now. 

By 20 min, most of the larger girls, Marshmallow included, are melting on the floor. They've all taken their selfies to show they work out, further workouts are no longer required. Turns out, full glam makeup doesn't fare too well when you're sweating buckets. Eyebrows were dribbling off faces and some people's faces looked like the Nile delta, with deep groves streaking across their heavily powdered faces.

The brand organizing this was starting to realize what a bad idea it was, throwing an event that forces a bunch of not-so-fit people to exercise.  We still had 40 more minutes to go.

By 40 min, I was feeling winded, but I could still follow the class. The only ones left standing are the average, fit or skinny girls. ALL the larger girls were down. Whoever said size isn't a predictor of fitness is so damn wrong. 

I noticed Marshmallow was literally rolling around, taking what I assumed she believes were seductive selfies. She somehow managed to touch up her makeup, I was impressed.

By the end of it, only the girls who actually look fit were still doing all the movements correctly. I know I was definitely starting to do smaller movements than before. 

So yeah. Take a group of people and I think everyone can predict with 99.99% accuracy how long each person would last in a Zumba class based on looks only. 
",HAES Debunked in ONE Zumba Class
fatpeoplestories,"S'up my cupcakes, pancakes, and all other cake based snacks. It's ya girl SoyMilk. 

This story is a little different to my Hamley Quinn series as it needs a little back story, so without further ado:

Tonight's cocktail, me: SoyMilk, a whole 17 years old, working at a vegan restaurant, still lactose intolerant, longer hair, single and bisexual (i'm experimenting) art student.

An Amuse-Bouche, BeanQueen: truly one of the sweetest people I have ever met, my manager, married to BurritoBoi.

Our appetizer, HappyRose: named cause she has some sickass pastel yellow pink hair, anorexic, film student with the best fashion.

The Main Course, BurritoBoi: tall motherfucker, awesome dude, spanish, married to BeanQueen.

Dessert, HoneyedBee: very christian, sweet as honey and soft as wool, generally nice person to work with.

AND OUR HAM OF THE NIGHT, READY TO BE CARVED AND SERVED WITH A SIDE OF MAC'N'CHEESE, SWEET POTATO CASSEROLE, BUT NO GREEN BEANS (have to watch our figure tee^hee): FullFatMilk: unnecessarily bougie, legbeard, rude, wears jewelry and nail polish in an inappropriate environment, tormenter of SoyMilk and so many others.

So when I was 14 I got my first job after deciding to try and improve my life, and this tiny vegan place accepted my request and I got an interview and the job. YAY SOYMILK YOURE NOT JUST WATCHING YOUTUBE AND EATING DAIRY FREE ICECREAM! So I was over the FUCKING CASHEW NUT CHEESE MOON. To put it lightly.

Working there was interesting and I very much appreciated it, so when the place went out of business I was really sad. However it meant that I could tell all y'all the stories that came about from working there with a clear ending. I have a lot of stuff about Hammy customers, but today is about FullFatMilk.

When FullFatMilk applied she had to do a week of less paid trial where she was trained as this was her first job. The first thing to note was that this 240lb monster of a 26 year old had NEVER HAD A SHITEING JOB PRIOR TO THIS, and had been leeching off of her parents and partners like an actual fucking parasite. Speaking of parasites: lice. Need I say more? She was a diet coked, HAES soaked ham, she didn't wash.

Her first shift was actually with me and of course she had to shadow me which was an experience. She leaned in too close so I could smell the fear that her stomach gave off because she had crammed it so full of fathershitting SubHAES. I'm naturally SICKENED by this but I brush it off along with the lice. She seemed nice but in the way a toddler is when you have ice-cream or something they want. She was a manipulative messy meaner. (See Mother not every sentence I say has a fuck-mothering cuss in it, ya bitch.) But it got worse on her second shift with me.

---------

If a restaurant has leftovers sometimes the waiting staff eat it. I'm known for it, it's why I'm no longer underweight. But you always make sure to leave some for everyone and you never steal food from customers' plates. 

HappyRose always secured a kind of coconut milk Red curry we had if that was going and I along with many other was completely fine with it. So one day we get a whole uneaten bowl of it and HappyRose nearly explodes into a stack of Tarantino films and black glitter, it's vile but I love her enthusiasm. FullFatMilk is also excited. She yanks the bowl from the side and takes a spoon of it into her gaping maw. She moans ob-fucking-scenely, and then tries to eat the rest. I take the bowl from her and remind her that it's for everyone. She tries to launch into a 'MUH CONDISHONS' but I'm bulimic and HappyRose is anorexic she does not get much sympathy from either of us as we both have been severely under weight. And her 'I HAVE TO EATTTT' was just making me think of that goddamn doctor from ""My 600lb life"" it was pitiful. HappyRose got fed up and left to go work and I got pissed and said something along the lines of ""Do what you want, I don't care."" So me and HappyRose are running floor and food and there's a fat sweating pig covered in makeup and curry in the waiting area. Truly a fucking marvel of nature. Jesus Fuck. 

She was also wearing a headscarf (we had to cover our hair to make sure we didn't have any hair incidents, long story short it happened one too many times in the past) that was PURE SILK. We are a V E G A N restaurant and this absolute used plaster comes in with Silk on her head. IT GOT RUINED WITHIN AN HOUR THERES OIL AND COOKING EQUIPMENT EVERYWHERE WHAT DID YOU WANT TO HAPPEN YA TWAT. She got very upset and cried and ate more of our food and then tried to get money for it and was denied. She also hadn't taken off her jewelry even though it's policy to remove it in order to limit problems. QueenBean came over.

QB: Jewelry comes off please.

FFM: But I need to look pretty for the custoMAHS.

QB: Take it off please.

FFM: You can't make me thats discriminaSHONS.

fatpeoplestories,"Dorm Hole 2

Part 1: https://old.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/8zqzj6/dorm_hole/

The RA and school security agreed to investigate the issue with the door. The situation regarding this is they won't change it til the end of semester because 1. They are cheap and 2. Fuck you. They did agree that because FN damaged the door she would be the one to pay for it. (Total cost around $900 for a shitty $60 door.)

Now that school politics are out of the way.

FN hasn't disappeared by this point but she has maintained her distance. Sometimes the neighbor's come over for CW's food, or sometimes we hang out playing smash brothers. It is an alright time for everyone. Buffmat STILL does not lock the door. FN kinda avoids us in class and around campus. The main scenario and situations with her were always around the dorm. Hence the name of the story ""Dorm hole"". The hole in the door wasn't really that much of an issue. If anything it made the dorm hallway smell like whatever CW was cooking. This was actually really nice because he enjoyed having people come over and enjoy whatever he was making. So cupcakes, breads, slow cooked whatever. If someone asked him to cook he would do it. He was trying to watch his weight so his was usually making salads.

One day however, he was going to make cheeseburger salad. Basically it was salad with fry sauce dressing and chunks of ground beef scattered on it. Its damn good and I really wish I asked him for the recipe. He made a huge bowl of it for everyone with extra meat for Buffmat. We all gather around the table and just begin to eat. CW serves what he makes family style. A huge bowl or platter in the middle of the table and you can help yourself. Lil'Haru and CW are usually the last ones out of the kitchen or table because they enjoy cleaning up together. CW washes and Lil'Haru dries the plates. It's always nice whenever they do this because the kitchen and sink will be pristine afterwards. 

After dinner we have a lot of leftovers so we wrap it properly. CW and Lil'Haru put everything away and clean up. They decide to have a movie night together and watch some Disney films with the lights off. It was then that CW noticed something in the poster blocking the hole on the door. There was a hole in it. Not a big one, but like.. enough to peel and stare inside. This doesn't set off any alarms yet mostly because we kind of expected this thing. The poster wasn't durable and was thin as hell. CW and Lil'Haru both ignore it. A piece of tape fixes it.

Nothing major happens, but we notice more food keeps disappearing from the dorm. First it wasn't that noticeable, but after making chicken parm and having three of the chicken breasts disappear over night? Ok something is up. CW hatches a plan, or maybe he just wanted to catch whoever was doing it.

CW decides that night to make spicy dumplings. They are extremely powerful and only those who like spicy stuff should eat them. Lil'Haru doesn't want any. Buffmat and a friend of his see how many they can eat, and I have a few of them. Rinse and repeat. CW and Lil'Haru clean up. 

This time though CW keeps a close eye downstairs. His dormroom is on the far end of the 2nd floor (the biggest room) because he shares it with Lil'Haru. For the record the dorm has 4 rooms 1 for each person, but since Lil'Haru and CW are basically living together we use one room as our study room and because his dormroom is so far away he stays in the Studyroom. That is when you can hear stomping down the stairs and then a loud ""AH HA"" is heard. 

FN is in our room stuffing her face with the dumplings and practically crying by this point. CW made a bunch of dumplings and we had a lot left. Nearly half of them were gone. FN is standing there sweating, her face flushed, etc. She tries to waddle her way out but she just kinda stumbles around. We call the RAs.

Now here is the tricky part, because the door wasn't locked it doesn't count as ""Breaking and entering"". FN was given a verbal warning though because she was stealing food. She did try and argue that it wasn't her fault because she is having difficulties eating and finding food.. our school has a literal buffet of food if you have the food swipes. If not its only $7 to get in and eat as much as you want. Lil'Haru and CW ate mountains of pizza together when they were having a lazy day. FN just didn't want to walk to the buffet which was about a 20 minute walk in all fairness. 

We talk to Buffmat about locking the door. We all just sigh and try to get on with our lives. Stealing food isn't considered a ""crime"" in this dorm because if that were the case the school would run out of students. A few days later however, we noticed another hole in the poster.

Things get a little.. creepy later. I mean they already, but I hope everyone is enjoying the story of one of my weirdest and more memorable college years. Yeah there def. were some wtf moments, but for the most part it was a really enjoyable experience despite FN's attitude towards everything. I do understand this was a bit of a boring chapter with nothing really involving FN and just me gushing over CW's cooking skills. Next chapter will have more of her.",Dorm Hole 2: The Boring Chapter
fatpeoplestories,"What's up all, long time lurker, first time poster, on mobile so spelling errors are going to occur.

So this event just occurred, oddly enough while I was browsing this sub. it's as fresh in my mind as the smell...

Let's get to the Characters:
Be Me: Male, 5'10, 175 pounds. Cook at slightly upscale hotel resteraunt. For privacy sake, let's say it's one of  two big name chain hotels in the US. my weight isnt crucial to the story, but I thought I would throw it in there
Probably don't be: V. Super small Polish Bartender and mother of two. upon first glance, nobody would guess that she has had two children. Unfortunate victim of the stench
Do not, under any circumstances, be: RollerHam. Uncertain of height because he's always in one of those rolling seats, not sure of the same. Easily 400-450 pounds, and smells like literal death.

The Story: As I stated above, I was browsing this sub between tickets at the hotel resteraunt. Our primary customer clientele is businessmen, so I don't get many orders on Sundays. As I'm reading some quality posts, (shout out to the poster of the Ham flatmate, sorry I cant remember your name) I notice a smell start to linger in. After first checking my reach in cooler to make sure it wasn't rotten food, I checked the dining room to see what it was. When I first glanced in, I immediately knew what the stench was coming from. There I see RollerHam, scooting his chair thing (Again, dont know the name) up to a table. V gives me the ""oh please god no"" look, and I nod in disgusted agreement. In preparation for cooking what I would guess to be half the menu, I make sure I have enough food prepped. 
V goes out from behind the bar to take his drink order, and I can see how hard she is trying to not gag. she comes back into the kitchen to explain her disgust, as well as dry heave a bit. I'm not joking when I say the smell was comparable to a pair of underwear worn to the gym, then left in the gym bag for at least a month. Because I know I can escape the smell but she can't, I give her some Basil to sniff so she doesnt have to suffer all that much. After regaining her composure, she goes back out to take his food order. 
In addition to not showering for at least a month, he must also not brush his teeth, because when V comes back to give me the order, she has to stop mid sentence and VOMIT into my trashcan. I dont mean dry heave, and I dont mean just a bit coming up, I'm talking almost projectile vomit. Thankfully, she gets it all in my trashcan. After cleaning up and washing her mouth out, she goes outside to get some fresh air, and I dont blame her. I had to stick my face over the grill to smell the steak I was cooking, because burning my face off was better than whiffing that god awful stench. As I'm cooking the order, I glance out into the dining room again, only to see the other guests we have also trying not to gag. I even had a guest bring me his plate and request it be transferred into a to go box. 

To keep the ending short and sweet, RollerHam eats his food like you would expect an obese person to eat, and rolls away without tipping. V and I breathe a sigh of relief, only to immeadetly gag again because he may be gone, but his smell sure as shit isnt. I feel super bad for the housekeepers here, as i can only imagine what his room looks/smells like. I also feel bad for the other guests, because to get a room here you have to pay a pretty penny, and having to dry heave while you have a drink certainly isnt what one would expect at an upscale hotel.

",The Ham that made the Bartender Puke
fatpeoplestories,"So, I have some steaming hot fatlogic fresh out of the oven-- with extra frosting.

I've been going to my aunt and uncle's far more conservative than what I'd prefer church. I'm living with them to save money while going to school-- I live near San Francisco and my rent is 1/3 of what it would be there. He also has mobility issues, so I go to help him get around. It means I need to go to church so he can go.

Anyways, I've been taking a summer class before the sermon, and we're talking about building bridges with the LGBTQ+ community, and how to negotiate that from a Christian perspective.

From the beginning of this class four weeks ago, this white woman who probably weighs at least 240 pounds and is very easily just a hair over 5 feet has taken a hostile, brashly, confrontational stance. From day one, she loudly announced that Gay people are oppressing her by forcing her to be tolerant of them. To make this even better, she added today that black people are too insistent too, and apparently, now white straight Christians are oppressed. She has loudly stated this several times.

The ironic thing, she was a fat woman with short hair whining about gay people, when she looked like a stereotype of a lesbian herself.

In peak fatlogic this morning, she went on to say she faced discrimination too. At first, I thought it was going to repeat it being about her being straight, white and Christian.

Nope, she was discriminated against because she was fat, and on top of that, had an abusive husband. Also, apparently, she was fired for not being tolerant of gay people. I'm guessing if she communicated like she did in our groups, she brought her firing upon herself.

Now, I'm not on Facebook, I can't just go HAM on her and then block her. I'm at my aunt and uncle's church, and what I said or did could reflect on them-- and therefore make my life harder and possibly risk my cheap rent (I don't think that would happen, but I don't want to risk it). There are plenty of shitlord things I wanted to say but I had to be tactful.

Fortunately, another woman in our small group who was an older Latina talked about how her guidance counseler told her that Mexicans wouldn't make it in school, but she got her college degree.

She goes on to say that gay and black/latino people can't really choose not to be gay or change their race, but you can lose weight.

I swear I thought the fat woman was going to start snorting like some kind of angsty buffalo and charge.

I even told her that if she talked to gay people the way she was talking to us, which came off as very angry, I don't blame them for being defensive.

Anyway, I brought up how I'm 300 pounds myself, and that I've dealt with some criticism for being fat-- but I never will deal with the violence and discrimination that GLBTQ+ people deal with. That I was a glutton, and that was my sin that I needed to deal with, so I don't feel like I'm worthy of judging gay people.

""Gluttony doesn't always make you fat!"" Everyone else in the small group looks at each other.

So yes, key fatlogic-- she's a victim because she's fat, but gay and black people are just being whiny and militant. Gay people can help it, and are not just sinning, but they're expecting too much by asking for equality-- but she's not fat because she's a glutton and can't help it. She's the real victim.

I'll be glad when the class is over next week, I'm sick of her. I think I'm going to go hang out with the international students-- less fatlogic and racism.","I ran into a fat, racist, homophobic woman at church who thought she was the oppressed one."
fatpeoplestories,"Welcome back to the Ariana Saga, the first part can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/8zwp6h/the\_ariana\_saga\_begin\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/8zwp6h/the_ariana_saga_begin_again/)

In the first part, I established that Ariana, is, in short, an annoying, hypocritical and generally terrible person who I wasn't very fond off. After the events of the last part, I begun to avoid Ariana as much as possible. This wasn't particularly difficult as Ariana spent most her time at her mothers, and when she actually deigned to attend university she rarely left her room. She had no need to, as she could store vast amounts of food in her room. We all could, as all rooms had a mini fridge along with storage space, including three large desk draws, clearly designed to hold pens, paper, and other things one would use on a desk. Ariana used these only to store various snacks. One day, me and some of the others in the flat where snooping in her room (Yes, I am aware that this is wrong, but in our defence one of the rooms was smelling, so we where investigating the smell, which was in the room opposite) and all three draws where filled with snacks of all sorts-chocolate, crisps, sweets, even little cakes you can get in supermarkets. In those three draws alone there was around £50 worth of snacks alone-that amount of money could have fed the average student for an entire month! Her mini fridge was filled with 2 litre soda bottles with opened bars of chocolate stuffed between the gaps, some even fell out when it was opened. The room in general was a mess, with rubbish everywhere and every available surface filled with snacks, rubbish, or random bits of crap like empty makeup containers, discarded socks and other forms of disorganised personal effects. Ariana rarely cooked, likely because she had mountains of food in her room to save her from the arduous 10-second walk to the kitchen and the maddening, torturous prospect of having to prepare her own food. Most of her cooking, aside from the pasta mentioned in the last entry, consisted of literal children food. Things like potato smileys, chicken dinosaurs and turkey twizzlers, foods so unhealthy the government had them banned from schools a decade ago, when Ariana was a small child. She would frequently delve into this, blaming the government of some form of grand evil comparable to a totalitarian regimes. Unsurprisingly, this was the only time she was politically minded. She would often eat her ""meals"" with a side of chips, or beans or close to entire bag of grated cheese, often having carbs with a healthy side of more carbs. She was also fond of (literally) the cheapest frozen pizzas she could find, every now and then she would place something between two pizzas and eat it like a sandwich. Occasionally, she would see me or someone else eating a salad or something healthy and make some comment about us not been hungry or how we had no need to starve ourselves. Once, she saw me grating carrot (for a salad) and asked me why I was doing it; she clearly hadn't seen it before. In told her it was for a salad, and then had to explain that the salad was the only thing I was having for lunch, and she left as is I was a legitimate crazy person for choosing to add more vegetables to a salad.    

After living with Ariana (and everyone else) for a few months, Christmas was approaching. At my university, first year students can stay at housing built by the university, with the expectation that you find somewhere for yourself in the second and third year. To help with this, in December, the university works with local letting agents and landlords to compile a list of student-friendly properties to help students find a place to live. Me and two others in the flat had become good friends, and with few options on my table I decided to live with them and the friend of one of them who didn't seem like a total idiot. Unfortunately, the others agreed that Ariana could live there too. This was not as insane as it sounded, as one of the residents actually quite liked Ariana (they shared similar inane interests, like the Kardashians, Zoella, and, of course Ariana Grande) and the other had a very chill live-and-let-live vibe who didn't much mind Ariana's flaws through some ""you should just accept people for who they are"" rationale that doesn't really work if that person is terrible. The other resident has never met Ariana and that left me as the only dissenter. It also made sense practically, as most houses in the area catered for five tenants (a four bedroom house with the living area converted into a bedroom) and Ariana was obviously a woman. Before she was added, we would get frequent rejections as our group ""had too many lads"" (ugh), which was ironic, as Ariana would become the one to produce the most mess and drama out of everyone. I approached many other friends in order to not have Ariana with us but unfortunately found no one. Ariana's flaws also paled in comparison to another roommate, who allowed a disgusting, vulgar and thieving friend to stay for far to long, and this friend would eventually sexually assault someone and the police and university authorities became involved. Ariana also handled herself well amidst a difficult situation over several days so I decided to give her a chance. Even if she was living at the house, I knew she would spent most of it with her parents or in her room.

When looking for houses, Ariana was predictably difficult, with unrealistic expectations of the houses we where looking at. She was two lazy to accompany us to many house viewings, and became fixated on a house she found online. The house was in the shape of a U, with two hot-tubs at both ends of the U, with a massive kitchen, living area and many en-suite bathrooms. This was clearly miles out of our budget but Ariana failed to comprehend this (she wasn't rich or anything, so she too had a similar budget to everyone else) and constantly told us we could afford it if we somehow haggle the price down or something vague like that. We eventually found a good house, with a responsible landlord (over a parasitic, soul sucking estate agent), a 10 minute walk to the university, with a nice large garden, decent kitchen and decor, with many well-sized bedrooms, all for just under the average rent for houses in the area. Ariana protested, insisting we could find a better, larger house, closer to the uni, all for less money. Fortunately, me and the others finally managed to convince her that the house was a good deal and we couldn't get any better, especially as the landlord promised us the house, as long as we where the ones to call before a certain time, when he was hearing back from another group of potential tenants. We signed the lease, ready to move in next September. Throughout the process, she complained that living together would expose her to ""male habits"" and frequently worried about the thickness of the walls. She would not elaborate on what exactly she meant by ""male habits"", but I would, eventually, find out. 

The remainder of the university year continued without a notable Ariana incident. She would continue to be messy, continue to make gross sexual comments and continued to be perplexed by salad, but I became quite adept at avoiding her (I could identify her footsteps over others) and I had many other things in life to care about than the opinion of an obnoxious, ignorant salad-dodger. Unfortunately, I would have less luck avoiding her in the second year of university. ","The Ariana Saga, Part 2"
fatpeoplestories,"I'm back with another tale of my former coworker (CW)! The first story is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/8yjupt/she_had_to_eat_the_whole_cake_so_she_wouldnt_be/).

The place I worked at used to have a staff picnic every year, our Spring Braai (a braai is a barbecue) where we would celebrate getting through another year and consume as much food and booze as we could on the company's dime.

All 35 of us who worked at our little cluster of bloodbanks would get together at the biggest branch to load everything into the work vehicles and go in convoy to wherever we had planned. This year we decided to go to a local lake for a nice braai and had booked space well in advance. Unfortunately for us, it started to rain a couple of weeks beforehand and rained pretty steadily all the way up to 2 days before our braai. We decided to turn it into a picnic because nobody wanted to be trying to tend a fire and cook if it happened to rain on the day. We couldn't cancel because Spring braai always took place on a designated date and the whole company would pretty much shut down except for essentials and emergencies. This meant only 1 day of downtime as opposed to individual branches shutting down for the day whenever they chose.

So the day dawned, cloudy but not raining (yet) and we all congratulated ourselves on getting picnic food catered (and quietly slipped a couple of bottles of sherry into the van to keep the cold out). We all arrived early and started loading up the 2 big vans with folding tables, picnic chairs, food, drinks, etc.

CW: We need different chairs.

Boss: Why?

CW: I can't sit in those flimsy plastic chairs and the arms dig into my body. We should take a donor chair for me! It even has a little tray attached so I could put my food there instead of on my lap! (For reference, donor chairs look like huge lazyboy-style chairs)

Both drivers: Lol, nope. Those things weigh a ton and besides, we don't have space for one with all the other stuff in the vans.

Boss: Nope. We are NOT taking a donor chair. What if it gets muddy or damaged?

CW pouted a little and wailed that we were being sooooo unfair guys! She can't help being a big girl! Boss then suggested taking CW's chairs just to keep the peace. Yes, CHAIRS. You see, we would have a weekly meeting at the largest branch just to keep things running smoothly and work out rosters, that kind of thing. CW was too large for the usual office chairs (frame and arms of square steel pipe with cushioned seat, back panel and armrests) so she used 2 office chairs identical to the others except that they had no arms. She would push them together and park one butt cheek on each seat and just about fit.

We all agreed to this and got packed and drove to the lake. We unpack everything and get it all set out. CW decides to sit a little away from the tables because of her little T-Rex arms; when she sat down she could hardly reach past her own flab to reach things on a table. She would instead rest a plate on her boobs and eat like that.

We all get our plates of food and grab drinks and sit down, including CW. Except she sat down, then further down.

The ground was still very soft and muddy from the rains so when she sat, the legs of her chairs sank straight into the ground. She went down with them with and couldn't get up again by herself. When we went to help her, she frantically insisted we rescue her plate of food first and put it somewhere safe. The drivers hauled her up and we used bottled water to rinse mud off her. The chairs were rescued as well and we decided they'd be fine after a good hosing down.

Not much more to tell. CW had a tantrum because ""we should have seen this coming and warned her!"" and she went to go sit in the back of the van to eat. We didn't see her again until we went back to get the dessert platters and found them eaten.

Two platters of mini milktarts, caramel horns, koeksisters (intensely sweet pastries deep fried and soaked in flavoured sugar syrup) and jam tarts.

Enough for 35 people.

Oh, and most of a bottle of sherry as well.",The work picnic (Titanic edition)
fatpeoplestories,"Hey, you may all remember me from several months ago, after I posted three stories under the title of Ariana, House Dictator, but never followed up on them. Unfortunatly, I was going through a major depressive episode at the time, and, as a misguided attempt to better myself, quickly wrote the stories, putting little care and attention into them. Eventually I forgot all about them until recently, and now wish to tell the story now I'm in a better headspace. I'm better now, hopefully, and thus more able to better tell the tale of Ariana, hopefully better than last time. I can't really remeber what I wrote and I foolishly deleted the original stories. So, without further ado, here we go!

I first met Ariana (thus named for her obsession with Ariana Grande) in my first year of university, in my student halls. In the UK, most first year students are allocated a room in university-owned student accomadation, with several flatmates sharing a kitchen, living area and bathroom, sometimes, but my builing had a private room with ensuite for 8 residents, randomly chosen. Ariana was one of these 8. When I first met her, she was around 300lbs or thereabouts. During freshers week and other introductory activities she wasn't very social or active, but I didn't mind, she didn't have to be friendly to the people she had just met and had been grouped with randomly.

A few weeks in, a local shopping district was running a student event, with discounts on clothes, food, and stationary. All 8 of us in the flat decided to go, as most where still in the process of making friends and meeting new people. I first noticed that Ariana was one of \*those\* when we all clothes shopping. As a group we where all in an Urban Outfitters. I don't like them, as I think they sell insanely overpirced, ugly clothes. As we walk throught he clothes as others in the group shop, I nonchantly give Ariana my opinion on Urban Outfitters to make small talk. She then goes on a 10-minute tirade against the ""fashion industry"" and how it is a an ""agent of the patriarchy"" by selling an unrealistic body standard, which many people would argue is true, but I quickly learned that Ariana also beleived in inrealistic standards for the shape of the female body. She claimed that normal size women like herself (again, she was around 300lbs and struggled with walking up the lone flight of stairs to our flat) where discriminated against and every store would simply not stock clothes that could fit a ""normal"" woman like herself. I simply agreed with her, why not? We had only just met a couple of weeks ago, and for all I knew she was correct. I've never shopped for women's clothes, and maybe all the clothes we had seen so far would not actually fit Ariana. I let it slide, and we contine to the next shop, a T.K Maxx. Down in the menswear section, one of our groups knocked off some Calvin Klein boxers, and Ariana gazes at the shelf, points at one of the boxes (the ones with impossibly attractive ripped dudes on) and address one of the girls with us, and says are university ""better be stuffed with good men like this"". No-one responds and I internally eye-roll, after hearing her speech on body image eariler. We ate lunch at Taco Bell (they're very rare in the UK so we where all excited) and I talk with the others about the menu as one of the first Taco Bells in the UK has opened near me so I'd been there several times already. Ariana then pipes up, saying that she choses to shop in Manchester over Liverpool (she lived between the two) as it (at the time) was the only one with a Taco Bell, and she enjoys eating healthy! I tell her that its not healthy, but, in her infinite wisdom, that Taco Bell is actually a Mexican brand and that Mexico is known for its healthy food, and is a very healthy country. I correct her, as Taco Bell is America and that Mexico has the highest obseity rate on earth. She looks me dead in the eye and says only: ""No-one likes a no-it-all"" like we are on a Primary School playground. She then proceeds to order a Big Bell Box (taco, burrito, fries, churros) and then two extra tacos on the side, and an entire platter of nachos, all for herself. Someone joking mentions that she must be hungry, and she responds that she is, she must replenish her energy after all the walking she as done whist shopping.

After this day, I began to pay less attention to Ariana. I could tell she would be a problem, and didn't want conflict. Besides, I was getting along with others in the flat and making new friends elsewhere. However, the first conflict would come due to Ariana's pasta infatuation. In her mind, she was half Italian, as her former step-father was Italian. Her biological father was not Italian, and her mother had divorced the Italian step-father years ago. I thought about telling Ariana this, that she is, infact, a pasty white English person with skin the colour of porcelein, and the closest she would have to Italian inside her would be after a 3am Dominos pizza binge, but I thought this to be a tad harsh. Anyway, someone who semmingly genuinly belives that step-parents alter the genetic make-up of themselves is not the sort of person you want to anger. The Italian step-father had taught Ariana's mother how to make the two most stereotypical Italian foods: how to make a pizza and how to make pasta, including tomota sauces and purees from scratch. Ariana had thus beleived herself to be a gourmet chef when she would heat up tomoto sauce made by her mother, mixed with store bought pasta. She claimed that home-made pasta was unhealthy because it contained flour, not that I ever saw any proof that she knew how to make Pasta from scratch, not that it is particually difficult. Ariana would never eat all the sauce and would accidently smear it on the lid of the communal bin nearly every day. The bin was one of those flap-down lids ones, that you have to push the lid to open it. Ariana would never clean this up. I confronted her, and she exploded. She begun by calling me various names, and then by claiming I was being discriminatory as the she could not bend far enough to push the lid of the bin far enough back to avoid getting the sauce on it. She stormed off, angry, after I made a comment about her weight. I can't remember exactly what I said (I think it was ""When did you last wear vertical stripes?"", or similar, it involved something about stripes). She would be vaguely hostile for over a week whenever I would see her in the hall or kitchen. Fortunatly, she would travel home every single weekend, somethimes sooner, only returing for her first lecture of the week, Tuesday afternoon. Often she would miss this (and god knowns of many other lectures) and simply stay at home for days at a time. When she was here she would spend most of her time in her own room. She was an easy person to avoid, unless you where on in a narrow corridor of course!

Despite all this, Ariana always gave a certain vibe. She was clearly fond of the male form, and would frequently make comments about attractive men she saw on TV or something, often showing the other girls the profiles of various thirst trap instagram accounts. The comments where usually quite innocuous, things like ""I'd let Ronaldo tackle me anytime!"". However, every now and then, she would comment on a person we'd know. One day, I had a friend from my course around, working on an assignment. Once he had left, she said to be, that he looked so ""innocent and fuckable"". Ugh. She would also frequently ask us, semi-jokingly, exatcly how much she would have to pay to get one of the male flatmates to ""plough me like a cornfied"". I also once mentioned that the guy in the room directly opposite mine would walk around naked much to often for someone with such large windows, and she would bug to try and point him out whenever a man entered the building opposite. I gave her the wrong window it was, and she never once worked it out. I liked to imagine her spending every morning staring into the window I told, which almost never opened their curtains. This behaviour was a bit annoying and borderline creepy, but it was also directed towards me. I don't wish to brag, but I'm a good looking guy. I'm tall, quite muscular and generally classicly attractive, which is just her type. The frequent comments made it easy to judge. I would constantly catch her checking me out and she would make comments on my outfits. I didn't mind, as I was quite accustomed to looks and the odd comment, as I often went out my way to show myself off, tighter than needed shirts, tank tops etc. She never made a vulgar comment to me directly, however in hindsight she likely did so behind my back, given on how she talked about others in my presence. I like dudes, and I would make this clear to her, telling her she was barking up the wrong tree, that she held the wrong tools, that I bat for my own team, and a million other euphemism for ""stop hitting on me, I'm gay"". I never actually said that though, and I now beleive that she didn't catch the meaning behind my many euphemisms. The day before the sauce incident, I was talking about the fact I'm a twin and that my twin is also gay, and Ariana was in earshot. She then left the room and would'nt speak to me again until the sauce incident a day later. Due to comments that she would make later, I beleive that she blamed me for decieving her, leading her on, etc. She then turned hostile because I was unavailable to her now. I always thought this was a very petty reason. If I where straight I would'nt have slept with her either.

That's the end of Part One, and I hope to post the second part in a few days. Thank you for your time!  ",The Ariana Saga: Begin Again

Setting

This was our final year of college. Everything is coming up nicely. Things are getting done, and graduation is slowly approaching. The worst is over and we all are just sick of school by this point. Being seniors we get the nicest dorms that are legally only allowed to be used by people 21 and over (they allow alcohol). We usually kept our dorm clean. The dorm had huge ass bathrooms with showers on each side for some reason.

Now finally, let us begin.
----

CookingWeeb and Lil'Haru are inseparable. They both have their issues but play off each other well. They have their likes and dislikes, but usually do everything together. I've known them since high school. CW promised Lil'Haru that he'll marry her when they were younger. She took it seriously. She told him she remembered what he said and reminded him middle school. They have been together ever since. From what I could gather. CW talked to Lil'Haru's parents (more on them later) and they were happy about it. Lil'Haru isn't perfect her right eye can focus, move, etc but she can't see anything out of it. It has a very clouded look to it too. Her back is also covered in scars for reasons unknown (I didn't pry.)

When we moved into our dorm. I'll admit I was a bit worried because CW suggested we all live together for our final year in college. We had one unknown with us, and he turned out to be really cool. So we were all happy. We move in and we notice the neighbor's across from us as well. We meet and greet them. They are all really cool. Our room was a corner room which was nice. Got a nice view of NYC from our dorm too. So it was pretty nice.

One neighbor across from us was late. She waddled up. Around 500 pounds of blubber? Beef? Hard to tell, but she was dragging in some luggage. That was it. We thought she might need more but turns out she just used one of those things to suck the air out of packets of plastic. She walked in and that was it. 

A few weeks pass and things are going fine. CW cooks daily for us, Lil'Haru cleans up after him. They are a team in the kitchen. BuffMat is always bringing damn good food. This was the shit. 

We hear a knock on the door and FN is there. She's wearing a hoodie and tight jeans. Everything is alright. She comes in, eats her fill and begs for more, but whatever. After eating everything. EVERYTHING she could get her hands on she burps loudly and then walks out. We just all kinda stare but whatever. 

Sometimes the neighbor's will come because they are wondering what CW is making. During the weekends he would make bread which is to die for. Rosemary Garlic Bread? uh. Yes. Please.

FN though started becoming a regular occurrence at our place she would come by during dinner everyday and eat all the food. Usually there would be leftovers. Lil'Haru never ate that much, CW was trying to limit himself, I usually ate one portion, and BuffMat would usually take one or two extra portions. FN would then devour whatever was left. BuffMat was cool but one day he just stopped locking the door for some reason. FN would come over and eat whatever she could find. 

One weekend we heard CW shouting at something. We see him talking to FN about something and she stomps off. He pointed to a bit metal bowl in the table. That dough he was going to use to make bread that weekend? Half gone. Turns out FN started eating it. He pointed at it and just got furious because he wanted to make a few loaves. CW just sat and put his hands through his hair. Lil'Haru walked over and just held his hand for a bit. He did use the rest of the dough to make bread, but he was still upset. 

FN came over much later at like 3am really upset for some reason and started shouting at us. CW and Lil'Haru come downstairs and see what is wrong. FN begins shouting saying how she couldn't have ""gluten"" because her body can't process it. I was doing my homework when she came in and started screaming so I wasn't really paying attention. FN turns to CW and Lil'Haru who just came out of their room. She looks at them and puts her mouth on her face and walks away. We kinda shrug.

I didn't notice it at the time, but Lil'Haru was wearing one of CW's shirts which basically acted as a nightgown for her. 

This was the time we got a short break between FN's visits and drama. CW kept cooking, BuffMat worked out, Lil'Haru kept being cute, and I just lived in my own world.

A week or so later after the incident though FN comes back to visit. She was talking about reporting us for attempting to poison her and because of pedophilia. She looked at Lil'Haru and said something along the lines of ""It's ok now. I'm here."" Lil'Haru didn't like this and got closer to CW. FN didn't like how close they are. We explained the situation, but she didn't listen and walked away.

3 Days later we get a knock on the door and the RAs and a campus officer come over. ""We heard that someone is sleeping with a minor here and providing them alcohol?"" We immediately knew who it was. Actually everyone did because FN left the door to her dorm open and was sitting facing the door smiling. Lil'Haru took out her ID, Student ID, and every other thing to prove she was of age. The officer walked away like, but the RAs remained. The RAs explained to use that someone reported that they were keeping rotten food here. It normally wouldn't be an issue but this dorm was just opened. We explained the situation again. CW got mad though and shouted ""What the hell do you think is going to happen when you eat raw bread dough?"" The RAs wanted to see the dough and they did. They performed what other checks they had too and left. We closed the door and not a second later FN was standing outside of it shouting something. CW closed the door on her face which just caused her to knock harder. We all tried to ignore her. I put my headphones, BuffMat went to the gym, and CW went to his room with Lil'Haru to do whatever. 

That was when we heard a crunch. I looked at the door and shouted up the stairs ""We got a problem guys"" FN literally punched a hole in the door. From slamming her fat fucking hoof on the door.

We called the RAs and they said they would investigate. CW and Lil'Haru just shrugged it off and put up a poster so no one can look inside. It would take them 3 months to fix the door.

----------------------

There is more to say about FN, but I wanted to get this out there. Hopefully you guys like it and I have more to write about this situation later. It becomes wild and a bit creepy at times, but it also became a college experience I'll never forget. ",Dorm Hole

fatpeoplestories,"Hello fps! I never thought I'd meet a ham in the wild but here it is!

Firstly, I am 5'2 and weigh 55kgs (around 121 pounds)

A few days ago, I went to visit the Rawal lake. It's a beautiful place to sit back and relax. The parking is about a mile away from the lake so it's a bit of a walk up to the lake. It's not exactly ideal for old or sick people. That's why they have golf carts running around the place. For only 20rs, you can have a seat in a golf cart and they'll drive you up to the lake and back to the parking. Quite convenient really.

I went to the lake a few days ago. The scene was great but it was extremely hot. The sun shone directly on us and we spent the whole day beside the lake. Around evening, I was completely exhausted. My family and I decided that we'll ride the golf cart back to the parking, just for fun. We all paid 20rs each and my family hopped into one row of seats while I sat in another row. Enter fat angry ham.

Now one row has 2 wide seats. But when fat ham sat beside me, I nearly fell off.

""Move over!"" She huffed while trying to arrange herself into MY seat.

""There's no more space for me to move"" I replied calmly and turned away.

""I said move over, greedy girl!"" She roared again.

I turned back to face her.

""To where?"" I screamed ""where do you want me to move? Look!"" I gestured at my seat to show her there's no space.

The ham glared at me while breathing loudly. Finally she narrowed her eyes and pushed me! I grabbed the seat in front of me to steady myself and glared at her again.

""My daughter needed that seat!"" She yelled at me as if I'm the one who stole it from her daughter.

""If you touch me again, I am going to report the security"" I hissed at her and turned the other way again.

She snorted but didn't say anything.

The ride was uneventful. Her body was pressed right up to mine and I could feel her sweating on my new white clothes. I scolded myself for not walking instead.

When we finally reached the parking, I immediately hopped off. As I was about to leave, I heard her murmur ""entitled skinny bitches"" so I turned around and screamed back.

""I paid for that seat!""

It was a horrible experience. Next time I'll just walk",Nearly pushed off a golf cart by a ham
fatpeoplestories,"I was visiting my ex-BF yesterday.     
Over the last few days he said he'd been noticing a musty smell, but thought it was due to the old fabric he'd brought out of storage &amp; was sorting through *(declutter, throw out, etc.)*.     
&amp;nbsp;     
Then we noticed that one of the ceiling tiles was... damp.    
He started taking it down &amp; it broke, crumbled into pieces, then he could see that there was a leak from the floor above.    
The wood of the floor upstairs was dark too, where the toilet upstairs had been leaking.    
&amp;nbsp;    
Apparently the woman who lives above is large &amp; unsteady and wobbles when she sits on &amp; stands up from the toilet, which does a number on the seal.     
Over time, it has developed leaks.     
Yes, this has happened before. The previous replacement was not the usual wax ring, but a stronger one which includes metal.    
&amp;nbsp;    
Visiting him again this afternoon *(what can I say - he has A/C &amp; I don't)* and they're repairing the toilet, replacing the ring again, plus shoring up the floor around the drain with extra lumber to (hopefully) prevent it from flexing (as much).    
&amp;nbsp;     
&amp;nbsp;     
ETA:     
I'm not sure if there's confusion, or if *(as usual)* some people are just going off on a tangent in the comments.     
What I'm describing is the ring between the base of the toilet and the plumbing pipe that creates the hole in the floor - that's the thing that wasn't sealing.    
Usually it's wax, and for most people that's not a problem, because most people don't wobble the base of the toilet fixture. Problem is, once it takes a form, that's it. Wobble the toilet, the wax stays the same &amp; water gets out.      
Sometimes it's foam, metal, silicone, or a combination of materials.    ",so heavy &amp; wobbly she broke the toilet ring
fatpeoplestories,"First time poster and I just happened to get my first FPS experience yesterday....yay?

We were at a swim meet and after your race you'd get a token you could exchange for a ribbon and popsicle. So my kiddo (6) is waiting in line for her popsicle and this mini ham (around 10, not sure on weight but clearly obese) pushes my kiddo and butts in front of her shoving her token in the popsicle ladies face. 

My kid and myself are just shocked and my mouth was agap as I saw MH waddle off triumphantly with her treat. I wish I would've said something but was holding my 2 year old who was being really difficult (outdoor swim meet all day with no nap) and I was about 10 meters away. At least it was a good lesson for my kiddo on not being a dick.
",Mini ham pushes my kid for popsicle
fatpeoplestories,"I have a 2nd story that would fit here. 

I work out occasionally, but I'll be honest, I hate it. I do it because I have to, so I don't look too flabby. 

Bit of a background, I spend too much time on social media, posting about beauty &amp; fashion, and I'm popular with the #effyourbeautystandards crowd because I have certain very ethnic features. 

Anyway, recently, I got to talking to a fitness blogger because we live in the same area, and one thing led to another so now she's giving me free training. It's awesome.

I'll call her Robin, because she looks the way Robin Wright did in Wonder Woman. Just pure, lean muscle. Since being a fitness blogger *is* her job, Robin usually takes videos of us working out and posts it on Instagram. I refuse to post any videos on my account though, because next to Robin's weights, the tiny weights I'm lifting look so pathetic and sad.

Robin is always really encouraging though, and would remind me that I was just starting out. She often told me that one of the things she liked about training me is that I already understood the importance of diet, so she doesn't have to drill that into my head. She told me that one thing she hates most about training people to lift is that many mistake being big with being fit, and think that lifting gives you an excuse to stuff your face with as much protein as possible because that's ""healthy"" and ""building muscle"". As long as you're ""strong"", you're healthy, no matter how large you are. This will be relevant later. 

One day, I got a DM from a person I'll call Helga, going, ""I saw you on Robin's stories! I didn't know you guys are friends! That's so cool!""

So we started chatting, and at first she seemed chill. She told me she's really into health and fitness, and LOVES lifting. She calls herself a ""power lifter"". Cool. 

We talked on and off for some time, and for the longest time, there weren't any glaring red flags, but there *were* some potential red flags in hindsight. 

Helga would brag about how surprised people were to see she was pure muscle, even though she didn't look like it. But Robin says things like that too, so it didn't stand out too much as a red flag.  If Robin isn't flexing and covered up, she just looks like a tall, svelte woman, and even I was surprised at how much muscles popped up when she flexed. It's like her muscles has muscles. It really takes you by surprise. Her favourite method of dealing with creeper in public is to just flex and you can see so many guys quickly have 2nd thoughts about harassing her. 

Anyway, Helga would also talk about how much protein she has to consume and would talk as if eating was a job, which requires fitness app to track how much protein she has to consume. She would talk about how she needed to eat more because she didn't get enough protein for the day. Still not really a red flag, because I know fitness freaks who talk that way too. 

As I got to know Helga though, I start realizing she's quite misogynistic. She loves going on about how she's ""not like other girls"" and from my experience, women who do that are generally the most fucking annoying types. Helga, believes she's very smart. She was a law student, you see. Sure, she’s unemployed over a year into graduation, but she was a law student. That makes her smarter than most girls. 

She'd also say stupid shit like, ""I'm not like those girls who go, ""Ohmygod! I need a job, that lets me like, do my hair for an hour every morning?""""

No one does that. 

No one.

Unless they're playing a pretty bimbo in a lazily written movie/tv show, that is.

Anyway, I just discovered BLACKPINK and I happen to mention to Helga that those girls have my dream body. I mean [check out this music video](https://youtu.be/IHNzOHi8sJs). Damn they look AMAZING. And our conversation went like this:

&gt; H: Ew what? NO! Their bodies are so shit!

&gt; Me: What? What the hell are you talking about? 

Ok, everyone has different definitions of an ideal body, but calling their bodies shit is a stretch. If you really want to trash their looks, you can say it's creepy how they have near identical noses thanks to plastic surgery, and I'll consider that a valid point. But there's NO WAY you can complain about their bodies. 

&gt; H: Their legs are sticks! They're in such bad shape!

&gt; Me: Dude. You definitely [can't dance that way](https://youtu.be/89kTb73csYg) if you're in bad shape. Check out their abs!

&gt; H: What abs? They have nothing! My abs are way more defined than theirs!

Now, all this time, I have never checked out Helga's profile. I try to reply to everyone who took the time to message me (if they're not creepers), so I don't have time to stalk everyone's profiles. Helga's profile pic was a photo of her face at an odd angle, which I guess should have been a red flag. 

All this while, I assumed she was extremely fit like Robin, and when she said she was big, what she meant was that she looked like a tall, muscular Amazonian goddess.

But after she claimed she has a better body than the Blackpink girls, of course I had to check her out. So I checked her profile.

I rechecked her profile.

I quit IG and reopened it in case the app was screwing up.

I rechecked her profile again.

Um.

Helga just looks....MASSIVE. As in obese sort of massive. I don't know what abs she was talking about, because in the picture where her stomach was showing and she was flexing her arm, I can tell she was sucking her stomach in so her obliques would show, but it still looks flabby. WHAT ABS? How the hell is this better than the abs of the BLACKPINK girls?? I have better abs than her and I'm in shit shape!

I was so confused, I had to talk to Robin to ask if it was possible to be a ""power lifter"" and obese at the same time. 

Robin just went, ""Remember what I said about people who mistake big with fit? Lifting a weight once and throwing it down isn't a work out. And even if you build a lot of muscle, you can't make up for eating the portion of 10 people everyday. Oh, and you're lifting nearly 2/3rds of what she's lifting even though you're just starting out and she's 3-4x your size, btw.""



",The power lifter with a hotter body than the BLACKPINK girls
fatpeoplestories,"Yo, long-term reader, finally have a tale.

My two-year-old daughter several months ago was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (should have been diagnosed at birth, but that's another tale altogether.) If you're not aware of the condition, in a nutshell her body has issue with mucus and it came to light when she was having trouble gaining weight as the mucus issue affected her digestive system. All is pretty well, but the medical team does want her to gain some more weight. Apparently it's a generality for people with this disorder to need to eat high fat, high calorie diets. So be it.

Now, when they told us she should focus on high fat, high calorie, they weren't just speaking buzz words. While she is obviously supposed to eat nutritiously, the calorie-packing suggestion list we were given is insane. What can you to make this piece of food even more calorie dense?

My story takes place yesterday. My kids and I were swimming with my sister, my mother, a few neighborhood friends, at my parents' neighbor's pool. I had a busy day of errands and activities, so had picked up a pizza for lunch and decided to bring the rest as an offering to the swimming event. My daughter had some fine nutrition earlier in the day and had been napping during lunch pizza, so I figured she had earned a big slice of pizza drizzled in ranch (Oh, calorie packing).

Neighbor kid. His mom and my mom are good friends, and so he wound up at this little shindig. I want to say he's a nice enough kid, as I absolutely adore the rest of the family including his psycho special snowflake sister. If I can adore her, certainly I can put up with your fairly standard high school kid.

I hate to call a high schooler a ham, but oh, this kid is. He has been the bane of the neighborhood for over ten years. Husband and I had purchased our home not too far from neighborhood, so we still got all the juicy stories. His poor mother and father have worked with him, begged him, all of it. I trust them to have done their best since a fair majority of their kids are normal. He had a rough patch once as a toddler, but all is well now. But he has a pity-me complex as wide as he is. He's mean, manipulative, awful.

So, he sees Daughter munching away at her ranch-drenched pizza. And he stares. Not at my kid, but at that pizza. 

It was a pretty big pizza because there was a deal and I figured at the pool it would get eaten, so I offer him a slice.

He wants it with ranch. Do you have any more ranch? No, I did not have more ranch. It was one of those single-serve packets I had brought with me. Sorry, dude. 

Meanwhile, our mothers are watching us, his mother with this silent don't-you-dare look.

I need ranch, Backroads. Pizza is so much better with ranch.

That it is. He lives half a block away. I remind him of this. 

But Backroads, why didn't you think of me with the ranch?

I had no idea you would be here. My kids wouldn't shut up about going swimming and my sister has like free access to the pool if she helps with the maintenance. Plus, I brought the ranch for my kid because of CF and we are encouraged to do crazy stuff like pouring ranch on pizza. 

He yells out ""I'm suppose to have extra calories too!""

His mom jumps out of her chair. Imagine having to babysit your high school student this closely.

Whatever, I think. Pizza's here if you want any.

At this point, my other kid shrieks at me to watch her as she does some trick in the pool. As I'm watching my other daughter, CF Toddler shrieks out in her bratty way.

I turn around to see High School Ham not only holding two slices from the box, but my daughter's half-eaten ranch pizza.

High School Ham's mother was furious. Pool Owner Lady (who is an old lady) goes off on a tirade on him. Essentially, his mom and two old ladies had to teach a kid with a friggin' driver's license how to treat toddlers.

TL;DR:  High School Ham steals fattening pizza from a baby with a serious medical condition.","I get to pack calories, too!"
fatpeoplestories,"This is my first post here, I've lurked for a while and some of the stories made me think of my former coworker (CW). 

I'm a fatarse myself. At the time of this story I weighed around 100kg, over the next few years slowly went up to 139kg/306lb and finally started to eat better and lose weight in December 2017. I'm down to 102kg/225lb now and aim to lose another 40kg. I was never into fatlogic, I just loved junk food more than being slim and healthy until recently.

CW though. I don't even know what her weight was. Look, I was fat enough to need the 2XL shirts and 3XL pants. She got the biggest golf-style shirts available from the company that supplied our uniforms which was 5XL and still had to go to her seamstress to add two 25cm panels of fabric to them and enlarge the sleeves to make them fit. Her pants and skirts she also had to get specially made. 

I worked with her occasionally when her usual donor attendant was off duty (CW was a phlebotomist at a blood donor clinic). We were part of the national blood services and had several donor clinics spread around a cluster of smaller towns and all the blood we collected went to the big testing and processing labs at head office. She worked as the sole phlebotomist with a single donor attendant at the smallest clinic in our cluster. 

Now CW was on a diet together with her husband. They would have oats or muesli together in the morning, he would pack a salad for lunch and they would have grilled fish/chicken and veggies for dinner together. CW was just baffled you guys, because her husband was losing weight but she wasn't and she just couldn't understand why. I understood why after the first time I worked with her.

CW and I arrive at work and the first thing she does after opening the doors is go and eat 3 packets of instant oats mixed with sugar and condensed milk because ""I'm staaarving! That little bit of muesli couldn't keep a hamster alive!"". This sustained her until lunch when she got a family sized meat supreme pizza from the little takeaway down the road which comes loaded with every single meat they have and is nearly 5cm/2 inches thick. Other days I worked with her when she didn't feel like pizza, she would have 2 burger combos with 2 boxes of chips and 2 large soft drink or 3 toasted sandwich combos with the same sides instead. Afternoon tea would be a family sized bag of crisps and/or doughnuts, cake, etc. Then she would go home and eat dinner with her husband while lamenting her lack of weight loss. 

The title of this story happened one day when I was unlucky enough to come into work and be told her attendant was booked off sick and I had to drive there and work with her. She went through her usual 2nd breakfast and lunch and then went to the bakery to buy a huge carrot and pineapple cake because they were having guests for dinner. 

She couldn't stand being around that cake without actually having any. I think it took all of 10 minutes before she broke. 

CW: Hammond, I really want a piece of cake. Do you think anyone will notice it if I cut a little piece to eat? I'll slice the rest of the cake at home and set it out on a platter and it won't look like any is missing. 

Hammond: I don't know. I'm sure it wouldn't really be noticeable. Whatever you want to do, it's your cake. 

CW: (after eating a piece) I think I'll have just one more tiny bit. 

CW: (after 2nd piece) Hammond, do you think they'll notice there's some cake missing now that I had that second piece? 

Hammond: Um. Maybe.

CW: I'd be so embarrassed if they noticed! 

Hammond: I guess it would be embarrassing... 

CW: I'll just eat the rest of this cake now and buy another one when I get home! 

Hammond: (WTF face) ok... 

She did. I couldn't believe it. I was a hambeast and I truly couldn't fathom how the hell she could pack away such a huge volume of food. 

P.S. She saw me on facebook recently and messaged me to chat. She told me I'm too skinny (No. I'm still a ham) and mustn't starve myself. Weight loss surgery is a scam because she had it and hasn't lost weight. By the way, have I heard of Herbalife? She's become a rep and would love to chat about it with me. 

P.P.S. I'm so sorry this turned into such a long story. 





",She Had To Eat The Whole Cake So She Wouldn't Be Embarrassed!
fatpeoplestories,"I have an instagram account that revolves around fashion and beauty that's popular among the #effyourbeautystandards crowd. One of my followers suggested I check our this sub and /r/fatlogic after I privately ranted to her about the way some of my followers act, and it has really opened up a whole new world for me. I finally get why some people behave the way they do, and I have a story that fits in this sub. Sorry if I keep things very vauge, I rather not have people finding out who I am in real life. 

So, the reason my account is so popular among the  #effyourbeautystandards crowd is because I have certain very ethnic features so I tend to get featured when an article/blog post needs to showcase women of [insert race here]. I first encountered that hashtag when people would post it in my comments with encouraging comments, so I got the idea that the hashtag is all about embracing non-traditional (ie. ""ethnic"") features. Sure, I noticed the hashtag is filled with mostly larger, white women, but I still thought it's about embracing all features that aren't considered traditionally ""beautiful"" like large muscles, larger noses, hooded eyes, monolids, thin lips, etc. So I started using that hashtag too and that's how a lot of my followers are from the #effyourbeautystandards crowd.

To be fair, even though I'm 5'3 &amp; size 0, no one has ever told me I can't use the hashtag because I'm not fat enough or anything. 

Anyway, I like to share pictures of my daily life on Snapchat &amp; IG stories, and that often means pictures of what I eat. I have 1 follower, whom I'll call Wanda because she looks like a Wanda. Wanda seems really lonely, since she would just comment on almost everything I post and sometimes, those comments just come off as bitchy. I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she's just not great with socialization. 

Anyway, this is the latest incident that ended up with me ranting, and getting pointed to this subreddit.

So, Wanda will always comment about my food to the point where it was kind of annoying, because she came off like she thought she was my mom and in charge of monitoring what I eat. I keep my answers light and short, the way I always do with followers I'm not close too. And yes, I know, since I do publicize my life, of course people would comment. A lot of people do, in fact, and I don't mind it. It's part of the package. Wanda just stands out because of the frequency of her messages and the intensity of her nagging. 

Recently, out of the blue, she just blew up on me. My favourite cookie company sent me a huge hamper as a thank you since I always post about them in my stories, so I posted a video in my stories where I was going nuts munching on all the different cookies while raving about how good they are. 

Note that at this time, I was completely uninitiated into the world of fatlogic, so for the longest time, I had not fucking clue what whas going on. I'm paraphrasing the conversation we have over DMs to make it more coherent. 

&gt; W: Do you know how selfish you are?! Posting stuff like this?!

I thought she was joking and making a dig about how ""influencers"" get a lot of free stuff.

&gt; Me: Sorry! I got too excited! These cookies are SO. GOOD. I have a feeling they sent me the hamper just because I've probably spent $1k on their cookies. They're probably thinking, ""This girl is acting a bit too crazy over cookies. Has she been cookie deprived her entire life?? Holy crap, let's send the poor thing a hamper!"" lol

&gt; W: Yeah, people are always nice to skinny girls. Do you know how lucky you are? Skinny girls can post videos of themselves eating and everyone thinks it's cute. If I post myself even eating a broccoli, people would tell me to go diet and call me a pig!

Really? 

&gt; Me: Nah, people think I'm a pig too. I AM a pig. But well, life's short and food's too good!

I thought that would calm her down but noooo.

&gt; W: You post yourself eating and people give you food because they think you're cute just because you're skinny! It's really not fair!

The asshole retort would be, ""Well, that's because I have over 50k followers. I can be a literal baboon in a skirt and people would still send me free shit if I have over 50k followers.""

I was just so confused at this point though, so I kept quiet because I had no fucking idea if she was complimenting or attacking me.

&gt; W: Do you know how offensive and oppressive your videos are?

No? What did I do?

&gt; W: I think it's disgusting how you're flaunting your privilege.

Ok. But part of my job is actually posting about the free shit I get...like that's the whole point of brands giving me free shit.

&gt; W: You have great genes that lets you eat whatever you want and stay skinny. Do you know how HARD it is for people like me who gain weight even if I starve myself, watching your videos? Please be more considerate of less privileged people.

Oh. It's not about getting free shit? 

Oh, ok.

Wait.

No.

What the fuck just happened?

I thought I should be real with her, so I just told her:

&gt;Me: I wish I can eat whatever I want and not gain weight! Instagram isn't real life! I don't post everything I eat here! I only post the fun stuff! No one's interested in a sad meal of steamed veggies! Unless I go fancy with how I cut the veggies, then that shit's going in my stories so everyone can see my awesome veggie carving skills. lol.

Oh btw, I do post my healthier meals on IG stories too. I don't count calories, but I know roughly that it's still a healthy amount of calories. And they're delicious meals too! But I'm guessing Wanda is under the impression that healthy food is literally only unflavoured steamed veggies, so she probably thought I never eat healthy. 

&gt; W: Wait, you only eat steamed veggies???

&gt; Me: That was a joke. I don't eat only junk food. I eat pretty much anything I want, but I do keep it healthy. My family has a history of diabetes so I have to watch what I eat.

&gt; W: You said you eat anything you want and then you say you watch what you eat??

I gave up talking to her.

Anyway, I don't know why I did this, but in my defense, I was in a cranky mood. I later posted a picture of raw vegetables in my stories, and made a joke about making up for the cookies (sorry, keeping things as vague as possible). 

&gt; W: OHMYGOD YOU'RE ANOREXIC!

Now she keeps freaking out over my lack of posting of food (""you're not eating!""), my healthy food pics (""you're anorexic!""), and my unhealthy food pics (""how can you stay skinny?!""). So I'm anorexic and yet it's a mystery how I'm so thin. Got it, Wanda.


I'm tempted to block her, but it's kind of amusing.

fatpeoplestories,"Lurker and occasional commenter, but please remove if not appropriate.

My husband and I come from active and athletic families, for background. I weight train daily and run the occasional charity 5k. We both come from families that eat healthy and understand what constructive cheat days are.

My Father in Law has recently been ill and he was scheduled for an ultra sound yesterday to look at his gall bladder. This is their story as told to us from their landline (mother in law (MIL) was on the phone in their kitchen and father in law (FIL) was on their landline in the living room because old people).

MIL: Well, when we first got to the waiting room there was no place for us to sit because even the empty chairs had parts of people in them!

FIL: Like fat! Fat was spilling out over the empty chairs. I chose to stand, but your mother was not happy about it!

Apparently they stood and waited for FIL's name to be called. His name was called after a bit and they went in. I guess he was told that he shouldn't eat anything before this procedure, so no breakfast - not even coffee. A few Hams in the waiting room had slurpees (free slurpee day at 7-11!) and a couple Hams had Jimmy Johns. My FIL was not happy about that.

Anyway, they get in to the exam room/ultra sound room and the very tired technician looked up and according to my MIL practically hugged FIL. 

MIL: She hugged your dad! She then went on to tell us that she was so happy that your dad was thin! She told us that she has to push so hard with the ultra sound wand that she can't even write in the charts when she's done. She has permanent shoulder damage from having to work with such large people all the time. And guess what?! The average weight is 350-600 lbs! I felt so bad for her!

FIL: She said I was her favorite patient!

My husband I got off the phone (finally, because we also had to hear about church drama) and were talking about how is being obese the new normal? At what point can medical professionals just refuse service - especially when it is causing irreparable damage (it sounds like) to nurses, ultra sound techs etc. How many L&amp;I claims do hospitals pay out because employees get hurt trying to provide medical care to Hams that could have preventative most of their problems by adjusting their lifestyle?",I don't know whether to be disgusted or amazed

So spake Lardbubble, whom I will exclusively refer to as Athena from now on. 

Quick recap of characters:

Me, 25 F, 5'5, 154 lbs at the time (Have lost 7 lbs ever since, yippee!)

Nivea, 25 F, 5'4, about 125 lbs

Athena, probably late twenties F, 5'2, approximately 250-260 lbs

Here's [Part One] (https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/8w9a17/i_am_fighting_fit_she_says_250_lbs_she_weighs/) for reference

**Onto the story!**

Nivea was beside me by this time. She is the sort of person to burst into laughter at the most inopportune moments. This was one of them. She started cackling hysterically while I just stared at Athena with what I like to call the confused Labrador face (head cocked to the side, eyes agog with intrigued puzzlement)

Athena continued to rant while being ordered to get out of the pool by the attendants as well as the matronly receptionist. The pool is pretty close to the reception area and the lady may have heard all the commotion.

Since the pool is part of a health/sports club, there were other people milling around, getting from one place to another, who had also stopped to enjoy the show. Many were giggling. Athena heard the sniggers.

They distracted her from me, the primary object of her attention and affection.

Swifter than you'd think, she streaked past the attendants and the receptionist, hands raised to clobber the hapless spectators who then scattered like a flock of startled pigeons. Her thighs jiggled, her stomach rippled, her arms flapped in the evening breeze. One side of her swimsuit rode up her… erm.

Athena gave chase to two teenaged boys who seemed the closest and they sprinted away until she stopped, panting, grasping her knees. 

By this time everyone in and around the pool was thoroughly entertained. Some were actually bent over with laughter, including Nivea. I just had my hands to my mouth, laughing all the same, yet afraid to show it for fear she would try another belly flop on me. 

The beast spotted Nivea laughing.

The beast stared at her.

Stared...

Stared some more...

Then having sufficiently caught her breath, bellowed something to the effect of **""HAAAAAAIIIIGHHHGGAAAAGGGGGGHHHH**

This, people, was Athena's war cry 

Before she **bent to pick up a slipper beside the pool and hurled it straight at Nivea's head**

**THWACK**

Athena had proved her prowess as the Goddess of War. She was good at war cries. She could run without being caught by the enemy. **AND** she was a skilled marksman!

The slipper hit Nivea square in the face. 

**""YOU COME HERE WITH ME RIGHT THIS MOMENT!!** the receptionist had completely lost her cool and despite being easily 50-60 lbs lighter, managed to literally drag Athena away from the poolside. Athena struggled but the receptionist was unmoved and continued to pull her away towards the club office. 

I quickly looked over at Nivea to see if she was hurt. There was a vivid red mark on her right cheek and she seemed more shocked than injured. She picked up the slipper and threw it out. The attendants asked us all to leave the pool as they needed to get it cleaned.

We filed out, headed to the showers, got changed etc. All the while Nivea and I raved and ranted about Athena, of course. However, Nivea was also like ""Rarely does so much drama happen in our lives! This was entertaining! They might cancel her membership. Damn. I am almost wishing they don't!"" while grinning like an idiot.

As we left the club, we spotted Athena along with a middle-aged lady who seemed like her mother. They were in the midst of a heated argument with the club staff. Which was when they spotted us.

**""That's her! That's the bitch who called me a Green Snorlax!""** pointing towards me furiously.

Stay tuned for more!

fatpeoplestories,"My parents love to travel. Because of them my family and I have had the experience of going to many places and seeing lots of things that others don't get to see. One year, my parents, my older brother and I went to the US. 

Everything was big. The cars, the roads, the buildings, the food...And the people.

We went to a dennys. Sat down and ordered. The food came. To my younger more portly self the portion sizes were amazing. Unfortunately at that age I had fatlogic aplenty so guzzled it all down with no shame and excuses ready if anyone objected. 

At the counter on one of those tall chairs was a man. A big man. So big, his girth flowed downwards so that you couldn't see the chair. Almost as if he was floating. He calls over the waitress and grunts 

""How much have I spent so far?""

I didn't hear her reply, but his response was to order another plate of food. One that went next to his other empty plates (how many, I can't recall. However one plate was more than enough, and he had several)

We moved on. our destination was mount Rushmore. We got there, wandered around. We saw the mountain with the faces which was very nice, but as youngsters my brother and I got bored and started to people watch to pass the time. After a while we started to notice a pattern. 

There were a -lot- of fat people. 

So we decided to start counting them. As we went on we realised some people were a level above. So we created different levels of fat people, with different points attributed. After a while we stopped due to the number that we could see.

It wasn't big nor clever to do this. We were young and bored and invented a stupid game to pass the time. 

But i think it was the first time I'd come into contact with so many people with weight issues and the point I first recognised how widespread obesity was, even then (which was about 15-20 years ago). ",Counting planets...
fatpeoplestories,"Hello, my fellow sugah addicts from around the world. Greetings from a
certain very rainy Indian city!
 
Please forgive formatting errors if any. I have lurked quite a lot but
written only two other posts. Also, I just might have a series up my sleeve,
so please pardon this reeeally long piece. Only if this is enough to rustle 
your jimmies/give you a beetus surge/insert other FPS cliché will I write 
more, else I will just slink away with sincere apologies for having wasted 
your precious feeding time.
 
Onto the story!
 
Maybe be me, Kinvara, 25 F, 5'5 and 154 lbs. Down from approximately 212 lbs
in October 2017 courtesy CiCo, swimming, and cycling.
 
Be Nivea, 25 F, 5'4 and 125 lbs. Super supportive friend. Goes cycling and
swimming with me sometimes. Very protective of me!
 
Definitely don't be Athena, late 20s/early 30s F, around 260-270 lbs I assume, with help from MyBodyGallery. Around 5'2 tall.
 
Nivea and I have been friends since we were in kindergarten. She has always
been a slim girl without much effort. I have seen her shovelling in junk food
on a daily basis. Cookies, cakes, pizza, chocolates (she loves Kitkats), pani
puri, ragda pattice, samosa, pav bhaji, chhole bhature (please Google), you
name it, she eats it. At least 1-2 fattening foods daily. She can literally
eat a mountain of fries and not gain a gram (that lucky bitch)
 
Now while she blessedly does not gain weight due to her eating habits, the
downside is she has never felt the need to exercise. A few months ago, she
went on a rainy-day trek with some friends to a nearby waterfall-mountain
thing and discovered that she could barely walk at a mild incline for 10
minutes before getting exhausted. This scared her, and pushed her into
joining me in my exercise sessions.
 
Now while I have a propensity to gain weight fairly quick, I have been
reasonably active throughout childhood (thanks, fitness freak of a father). I
used to play badminton, volleyball, dodgeball, go cycling, swimming etc. Last
year a budding relationship went bust when the guy said I was too fat for
him to stay attracted to me on a longterm basis. Hence the lose-weight-a-thon.
 
Anyway, so one fine June evening I went swimming to this really nice pool I pay a bomb for. I usually swim four days a week and go cycling thrice. Nivea and I were at the poolside, doing some mild stretching before we entered, when we see a considerably overweight girl walk towards us, presumably heading to the changing rooms. She walked with a certain 'swagger', with a very haughty expression.

Then she looked me over top to toe, and smirked.
 
She trundled past into the changing rooms while I flushed with acute
embarrassment. I am still very conscious of my body and even if this girl was
a good 100 lbs heavier than me, I felt gross and ugly. I surreptitiously glanced over my legs to see if more cellulite than usual was showing. I have a bulgy varicose vein below the back of my left knee which I am EXTREMELY conscious about. I didn't feel like swimming anymore.
 
Nivea had spotted that look too and she glared after the lardbubble's
retreating form. She could read my mind, of course. 20 years of friendship
and all that. She just hissed ""why are you paying attention to that fatass?
Just jump in!"" before giggling and muttering ""let's wait and see what she
looks like in her costume!""
 
That girl can cheer me up anytime!
 
So we got into the pool and once I started doing the laps, I almost forgot
about the smirk. Now Nivea tries to keep up with me but only can manage 2-3
lengths at a stretch before she needs a
""I-want-to-float-and-feel-like-a-mermaid-for-just-five minutes-damn you""
break. I usually go 10-12 continuous lengths before stopping to catch my
breath for a bit.
 
About 10 minutes later as I am done with my 12th length, I take a break to
adjust my cap etc. It is then that Miss Smirk struts towards the pool in all
her glory.
 
Like I mentioned, I am very conscious of my body. So I wear black swimming
tights and a top, and not a costume which may reveal more of my arms and back. This lady, however, has worn a halter-neck style costume which barely skims her
upper thighs.
 
It's lime green. Probably the most unflattering color on someone of generous
proportions.
 
And her proportions were copious.
 
Her arms bulged out till the elbow before bulging at the forearm level too.
Her navel was pressing against her costume in such a way that it made me
think a child was trapped in her belly and screaming soundlessly to be
please, PLEASE be let out.
 
Her thighs though. They rippled with pouches of cellulite that each seemed to
have lives of their own, jiggling and jostling with every dainty step she
took.
 
Nivea and I exchanged a glance across the pool. She was floating near the
8-foot depth marker while I was at 3 1/2-foot line, preparing to continue to
laps. Nivea openly grinned, looking from lardbubble to me. I didn't make eye
contact with the lardbubble but I smiled to myself.
 
She stood by the pool near the 5-foot depth marker. I was ready to continue
my laps when she goes ""Hey, you!""
 
I look up to see her giving me a death glare. She cocked a finger at me,
indicating that I should come closer.
 
Rude.
 
Very rude.
 
I stood my ground and raised an eyebrow at her. ""What?"" I said in a deadpan
(I hope) voice.
 
""What are you laughing at, fatty? Standing in the shallow end like a child.
Do you even know how to swim? This is not the beginners' batch timing. Now
get out. There are some of us who actually know how to swim."" She says
without pausing to take breath or even letting me answer.
 
""Oh is there a problem? Pool not big enough for you to get in?"" says Nivea,
who has by then sidled up to me, in a mock innocent voice.
 
Call me beta for not telling off the lardbubble, but I was super embarrassed
at being called a fatty in public, with at least 3-4 other people within
earshot. Nivea's comment broke the tension and I laughed. I ducked and
started to swim, wanting to avoid any further conversation with her. I can,
however, be passive aggressive. So I did my best swimming in those laps. I
combined freestyle, butterfly and backstroke (breaststroke is a tough bitch,
I simply cannot) to show her that I indeed did know how to swim.
 
All this time she has not stepped into the pool and is just watching me with
her beady little eyes, angry frown writ large on her face. While swimming my
8th length, I manage to relax enough to stop being conscious of her stare.
 
And then…
 
Before I can fully fathom her intentions, she crouches in an about-to-jump
position, runs the three feet to the pool, and BELLY FLOPS straight in.
 
Remember guys, the depth here is just 5 feet. Diving is absolutely dangerous
in this depth and can cause serious injuries. Fortunately I was quick enough to
dart out of the way before she landed on me. However, she fell into the water
with a loud SPLATTTTTTT and I knew she would be hurt.
 
I went closer to check on her before she emerged. And yes, there are pool
attendants to stop people from doing silly shit apart from VERY visible 'No
Diving Here' signs, but everything just happened too fast.
 
Then she emerges waaaaaaailing
 
""You BITCH!! How dare you provoke me!! I have broken my shoulder because of you!"" she screamed, clutching her arm.
 
""What the hell? How did I provoke you? Do you not have a shred of sense to be
diving in five feet of water? Are you crazy?"" I yelled right back.
 
""Don't you dare presume to teach me! I am a state-level swimmer!! Don't you
dare test my patience fatty!"" she says, advancing towards me.
 
Everyone is watching. The attendants start yelling at her to stop, for us to
break it up. She doesn't listen and trudges towards me. I am frozen. Nivea is
watching this exchange with her mouth agape.
 
Lardbubble then shoves me. Once, then twice. I am angry by now and I push her
hard so that she topples back.
 
She rises again, no evidence of the dislocated shoulder this time, and with a
loud HARRUMPH she collides with me, shaking me like a rag doll, clawing at my
chest.
 
People have started to intervene by now and a couple of guys pull her off me.
When she realises she has been overpowered, she screams at me ""How dare you
insult my swimming?!! I am fighting fit! Fighting fit! I am as strong as an
ox! Just you wait, I will show you, you fat hog! I am the goddess of war, I
will show you!!""
 
Yes guys, she actually said this. This came out of absolutely nowhere.
Goddess of war, WTF?
 
Thus, Athena descended upon so-not-her-home-country to shower us mere mortals with her benevolence.
 
Was Athena hauled back to Greek heaven before she could show poor ""fat hog
me"" her prowess? Stay tuned to find out! :D

fatpeoplestories,"If you waded through my first HamGram epic, then you'll know that she blames exercise and healthy eating for her heart valve surgery with a staggering mix of fatlogic, tabloid 'data', and self-gaslighting. If you didn't read it, then I just told you the information you need to know. HamGram needed heart surgery to replace a valve and it most definitely wasn't because of her 60 years of little/no exercise, diet of heavy creams, butter, lard, bread, deep fried things, and pastry (made with lard because that's the right and natural way) and definitely was because of her 3 years of occasional gentle walks, twice-monthly yoga, and the flax seeds and walnuts she added to her meals to 'healthify' it.

HamGram hates exercise, and hates people who exercise. This includes my mother. Me, occasionally. Mostly, she just thinks my mother (her daughter) is a psychotic exercise-addicted anorexic controlling crap mother, and I'm her victim. (Actually, I'm the exercise addict, and I'm the one who got my mother engaging in healthy dietary replacements and... anyways.)

The characters: Me, Middle, 25F. My sister, Eldest, 26, F Mum, 50F. HamGram, 70F. My sister, mother, and I are all around 115-130lbs, wear mostly size smalls, all are conscious of nutrition and exercise. HamGram mostly lives on butter and donuts, and is at least 250lbs.

HamGram is kept in the dark about a lot of things, for everyone's safety. She knows this, and it's led to her often driving by our house, sometimes driving around our house (""The lawn is a mess already, it's not like my tire tracks are noticeable. You don't take care of anything and are a poor houseowner,"" HamGram tells Mum regularly. Thank god we spend 9 months of the year with 4+ feet of snow so it doesn't always happen) sometimes letting herself in with one of the dozen key copies, digging through our mail, our stuff. We were out of town last weekend and our phones rang a lot, and we did not answer. There's no law saying we need to answer cell phones. We are under absolutely no obligation to be at people's beck and call all the time. We were busy running a half marathon. We left Thursday night, she found out Friday night from her other daughter, my aunt, and we ran Saturday morning at 7, because most races are early in the morning, when it's still cool, and won't interfere with traffic.

Just a second of happy happy good feels: me, my mother, and my sister all ran that half marathon together a two weeks ago. My sister and mother crossed the finish line together, being AMAZING and running it in 2:05, and I PR'd by over 10 minutes, running a 1:43. We had a great time and we love having this in common, and I feel so blessed to have such a healthy, supportive, strong family. Anyways, back to HamGram.

At 11:00AM on Saturday, I receive a text from HamGram, wishing me good luck at the race. Now, I never respond to HamGram, because feeding her just makes her hungrier. But I was in a good mood, and replied simply that the race was already over, but thanks anyways. She asked how it went, using three texts and several dozen heart emojis. I simply said ""I won"". She asked how Mum did. I said ""she won."" She sent more texts, asking for more details, but I decided that was enough interaction. I was already starting to feel like my three texts, each containing no more than a dozen words, were going to somehow get me into trouble. I was right.

A few minutes later, Eldest shows me something on Facebook. I've had HamGram blocked for a while now, so can't see her posts. Eldest is showing me a post from HamGram that takes a long time to read, because of the quantity of brightly colored emojis mixed with the words, but eventually I'm able to determine that HamGram has just congratulated Middle and Mum for winning the marathon!!!!1!!111!!! It also links to a tabloid article talking about the dangers of running and how to avoid death by running because HALF MARATHONS KILL. (Eldest attempted to open the article and was spammed by so many pop ups and alerts that she immediately backed out before reading anything.) This is why I don't interact with HamGram unless absolutely necessary, because she deems it necessary to scream it from the rooftops via facebook. I receive a few texts from curious friends asking if I won a half marathon. I did not win it, there were 3000 people there and I was pleased to be in the top ten percent. It was awkward and embarrassing.

Skip to Monday night. The phone rings, and Mum answers it. HamGram is on the line. I won't be able to replicate the exact phrasing of the conversation, but I am not being hyperbolic when I describe the tone and emotional reactions happening in this encounter. The tone will be in italics. This is the conversation:

HamGram: So you ran a half marathon. What is that, fifty miles? *Short, clipped tone*.  
Mum: Yeah, we did! It's actually 13.1 miles. It was downstate, we-  
HamGram: So you're, what, a marathon runner now? Is that your new thing?  
Mum: No, I just wanted to try one, and it was just a half. I probably won't do another-  
HamGram: You're lying.  
Mum: What? No, I'm not... I just did it to see if I could, I'm not-  
HamGram: You're lying. You always lie to me. Nobody told me you were running a half marathon. Why did nobody tell me? *Now tearful with small hiccuping 'sobs'*  
Mum: It wasn't like it was a secret! We just didn't want you to feel obliged to come down with us, it's five hours away and expensive to stay in a hotel-  
HamGram: You and Middle won a race and we weren't even there to see it! *Still crying*.  
Mum: No, we didn't actually win... she was being sarcastic. We won in our hearts, I guess! But nobody actually wins races. I mean, someone does, but we don't. We just run.  
HamGram: So I WAS lied to! You're just lying to your stupid old HamGram, I'm sure you think it's really funny to tell me that you won because you knew I would believe it! *Angry, shouting now.*  
Mum: What? No. You know Middle is always sarcastic, and she didn't mean to-  
HamGram: So you didn't win. I should've known, you don't eat enough to have energy to win. You never eat pie or bread or potatoes, you probably endangered your life out there, running on nothing. Your body could've shut down.  
Mum: ... No, my body didn't shut down. We all eat fine. We all ran fine. Middle got a personal record, and Eldest finished with me-  
HamGram: Eldest was there!?! So you were hiding that from me too?! I see. I see. You just leave me here to get old and die while you all have a great time partying and killing yourselves, I'm going to outlive you all because you're killing yourselves, did you see the article I sent-  
Mum: We aren't hiding anything from you! We just didn't think you'd be interested, since you hate exercise!  
HamGram: Well look what exercise did to me! I'm just looking out for you! And your daughters, you're killing them too, I know you don't let them eat anything except vegetables, I know they're not allowed- *Quiet, harsh, hostile*.  
Mum: I don't control what they eat! I don't control their exercise! Look, I've got to go.  
HamGram: Of course you do. Because you're always so busy. But busy doing stuff I can't know about, it's all a secret and you're too busy for us. Me and Gramp are just waiting to die and you're too busy to ever see us. I get it. *Crying again*.  
Mum: No, I just have to get going. I'll talk to you later.

HamGram attempts to link me to several facebook posts with the food pyramid, articles about carb loading, recipes for pre-race spaghetti. Since she can't connect to me on facebook, she sends them to other family members saying COULD SOMEONE PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH MIDDLE IF YOU SEE HER, SHE HAS ME BLOCKED AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER HEALTH. DON'T WORRY, MIDDLE, I WON'T TELL MUM IF YOU WANT TO COME OVER AND EAT AND NOT STARVE. I've gotten a number of worried and confused texts from people about this. My sister only half-jokingly suggested we get a restraining order. I'm terrified she's spreading rumors about me. Actually, I know she's spreading rumors about me. I was up at my aunt's for the 4th of July, and my aunt's neighbor, a man I've never met, said he was surprised to see me eating a few M&amp;M's from a bowl on the counter. I asked what he was talking about, and he said my grandmother (HamGram) told him that I starved myself and didn't eat anything except vegetables, and had told everyone that's why I didn't touch her potato salad, and also that my mother was controlling what I eat. (He said he was pretty sure she was a little exaggerating, as he was a pharmacist and knew a lot about health, and was immediately sure that she was a gossip and a bit of a health idiot. Thanks, man, for not taking any of her shit, and telling me about her crazy gossip.) I don't know who else she's talking to. This is actually really distressing, as I work part time as a group fitness instructor and a lot of the women there are friendly with HamGram. I haven't heard anything from them yet, but the last thing I need is rumors of that going around.

HamGram left a bulk store sized tub of potato salad in a bag beside my car at work a few days ago, with a note saying OUR LITTLE SECRET XOXOXOXO. It went in the garbage.",HamGram II: I'm Apparently a Starving Ultramarathon Winner.
fatpeoplestories,"My brother and I went to Medieval Times this past Sunday because we thought it would be fun since the last time we went was when we were kids.

We arrive at our designated seating row only to find it filled up by an obese family. The last two seats were reserved for us but due to the sheer size of one of the family members, he was occupying half of my brother's seat.

We asked to move seats because there was no other way we could squeeze in. They moved us to the Black Knight section in an empty row. My brother and I thought we would be safe and comfortable here. Nope. A group of people came in to occupy the row too. It would have been fine if it weren't for the obese lady next to me spilling into my personal space. I didn't even have room to move my arms to eat.

I spent the entire show feeling I'm trapped in a small closet. Definitely soured my experience. But personally I think Medieval Times should have spaced out the seatings better.

I never had any problems with hams until this experience. My disdain for fat people was born this day.

**Tl;dr Fat people inconvenienced me twice.**

**Edit: spelling**

***Edit: Looks like I started a war down there in the comment section.***

***I left out details about the night because I wanted to keep the story short and simple. The table row had room behind the chairs so that if any one wanted to leave to use the restroom, they could just walked behind everyone else. This person was so fat that every time she had to leave, both my brother and I had to get up and exit the seating row for her to leave AND do the same thing when she returned. This distracted me from the show, it greatly inconvenienced me. This might sound trivial if it happened once, but it happened multiple times during the show, and every time it happened, I became more and more pissed off.***

***These issues would not have happened if they were not morbidly obese. If the venue had a full house that night (it was pretty close to being full that night) , we would have been shit out of luck in terms of changing seats. We would have had to refund our ticket and go home because there would be no other seats. Why would we have to waste time and gas to come to downtown just because someone else caused us inconvenience?***",Medieval Times
fatpeoplestories,"About a year ago, I was working parttime as a caretaker for people with disabilities. These were mainly people with for example lower limb paralyses who were living in their own home, but needed external help to go to take a shower or go to the bathroom or whatever. Now, living in these houses is a privilige you have, provided by the government and the country where I live is build upon a caring society. So if I would break my neck and be paralyzed from top to bottom, I would be assigned a nice, spacious house, with all the help and comodities I wanted. 

After a few months working at one place, I got assigned to a new place with new clients. Most of them were pretty standard and it was not difficult to see why they would be living in such a house. But there was one client (the ham planet)  that seemed an exception to the rule.

I am a pretty sturdy guy and I don’t mind seeing and smelling feces or pee, but nothing prepared me for the smell that struck me when I walked into the house of the hamplanet. Picture my face when I walked in the room and saw a giant 450 lb transgender ham planet sitting totally naked on her bed, who had not showered for a week. The smell was so bad, I had to breath trough my mouth. I stayed professional and did not let her notice my repulsion, or perhaps she already knew and didn’t care. Fortunately for me, she could walk with her rollater (which was twice as wide as a normal one) to her shower chair (which was also twice as wide as normal) and I just had to hold the shower head above her and on places she couldn’t reach herself. 

During these showers she would tell me a bit about herself and the more I heard, the more outraged I became. Five years ago, she broke her pelvis after she stumbled over a loose paving stone in the street. She was so fat at that time that she was declared physically impaired and that’s how she got the house. So even after a gastric bypass, she was still at a very heavy weight 5 years after her accident. Her pelvis healed but she still needed ‘help’. I got the feeling that she only called us in, so that the government would think she was eglible to live there. In these 5 years she also decided that her male body was not what she identified with and decided to undergo a gender operation (of course at the cost of the government again). I honestly didn’t see immediatly that she was a woman, because her genitals were covered under a royal layer of fat. She used her gender change as something that was causing her mental issues, and this was also how she was still not kicked out of her place.

Short to say, I was not happy and comfortable with helping someone who was cleary a parasite in the system so I decided to bounce that place a couple of months later. How could someone like her honestly think that she was a victim? It still baffles me to this day when I think about it.",My story as a caretake (I still remember the smell)
fatpeoplestories,"Need to know for the story to make sense:
The company that I currently work for holds a quarterly fitness challenge to all of its employees. Whoever wants to participate has one week from the first business day of the quarter to sign up. 

This year, there are two aspects of the challenge. For those who only workout once to twice a week, they have a challenge called Burn. For those who work out 3 or more times a week, the challenge is called Inferno. The aspects of the challenges are the same. Most weight lost, lowest BMI, lowest body fat percentage and so on. Each of the challenges have different levels for each category. 

Characters of the story:
Me! I’m actually 5ft, 11.7 inches tall. I weigh 267. I’m at the gym at least 4 times a week. I had to take a break for a month because I hurt my back and shoulder. My BMI and body fat percentage are my business. 

NBFP – (NeckBeardFatPerson). He’s actually an alright guy. I just don’t get why I’m his competition now. I don’t really know him, but by looks and appearances… I’m going to call him NBFP. 

On to the story (I have a feeling that this is going to be part of a series for me… sarcastic “yay”).

I signed up for the Inferno part of the challenge yesterday. They told me I couldn’t sign up for the Blaze part of the challenge because I’m always at the gym. I got my measurements done and so on. While I was signing up, a guy I know in a different department of my company was signing up as well. He’s an alright guy. However, I have no interest in being his friend or befriending him. 

After we both got our results, I proceeded to work out. He asked me which challenge I signed up for, what my BMI or body fat percentage is and so on. I told him which challenge I signed up for. I didn’t answer him in regards to my BMI or body fat percentage. He even wanted to see my information sheet with all of the data from the tests. I pretty much ignored him. 

I was working upper body yesterday. As was he. The only thing that go to me during the workout was that he kept asking how much weight I was lifting, why not do this or do that and so on. At first I was being polite and answering him after I had finished a set. Afterwards, I put on my ear buds and just turned the volume all the way up. He started yelling his questions. I just ignored him. 

Today I had to go to the gym during my lunch instead of before work. Lo and behold… he was there. I didn’t really think anything of it. I just left it. Went to the locker room, changed and then went onto the floor to workout. It was leg day today. He comes over to me and tells me that he’s really competitive and asks me what I think my chances of winning are. He tells me he’s taking some fat burner and supplements, that he’s going to do intermittent fasting, drink more water and so on. THAT’S GREAT!!!!!! I DO NOT CARE. 

The goal of my new workout format is to make sure my form is solid and to lift moderate to heavy weight for at least 3 sets of 8 repetitions. I’m working slowly on that. Like 2.5 lbs per round per week. It’s slow but rewarding. 

It’s also leg day for NBFP. That’s awesome. He’s on a 4 day split too. Which is good for him. After each set, he talks. I keep looking at my watch waiting for 90 seconds to pass before the next set. I’m doing deadlifts. He’s doing squats. His form is a little off, but ok for light weight. He tells me that my form is way off and that it’s ok to let my shoulders go forward instead of pulling them back. I’m pulling 255 on the deadlift. He’s doing 145 on his squats. I ignore it. He had 5 sets of 5 to do. I had 3 sets of 8. That’s fine. Doesn’t matter. I walk over to the pull up bar to hang and stretch my back out. He comes over and tells me that his squat is suffering because of his gut. He tells me that he doesn’t understand why his gut is still there. I ask him about his diet and he goes on about “I work out every day or at least 4 times a week. What does diet matter if I’m working out?” I don’t say anything. Personally… I don’t care. But I guess I do because I’m bothering to write this all down. I gave in after his second attempt at just talking about how he did so good the last challenge and blah blah blah. I tell him that in order for exercise to be effective, for weight loss to happen, you have to know your calorie intake, what your goals are in regards to physical fitness and taking the steps to achieve them. He said that’s all bull and just skinny people logic. I walk away and go to my next set. He pushes me for info on my BMI and body fat percentage. He willingly tells me his. I said that mine was lower than his BMI and his body fat percentage. As I’m walking back over to the rack, he comes in front of me and says he wants to try. That’s fine. Interrupt my workout.

In the back of my mind, I’m cursing myself for not recharging my ear buds the entire afternoon. 

He does 3 reps. He goes on to state that he weighs 275. I’ll admit. He doesn’t look like it. I would guess less than me. The bar has 255 on it. I weigh 267. He weighs 275. I tell him that this is my last set on the deadlift. He moves to the side. I pull 8 times and do a controlled lowering of the bar without dropping it. 
He gives me shit for it. I laugh it off and tell him that he’ll get there if he really wants to. He goes off on me saying that what makes me think that he doesn’t want it. I laugh. He says that he’s really competitive and that he’ll beat me in the challenge. He walks off yelling that he’ll see me tomorrow. YAY!!!!!!!!!!!


TLDR… I don’t even know… I just wanted to lift heavy things, put them down and lose weight… WTF
",My new gym buddy...
fatpeoplestories,"So my aunt has been hanging out with some very lax parents with entitled children lately, and I guess they've influenced her. 

I just hung out with her and she now thinks it's my parents' and her fault that my sister is the monster she is now. 

""We were too hard on her,"" she told me sadly, ""I still remember when she was 12. I told her she has to run on the treadmill or I won't take her out shopping. She was crying so hard. That was a mistake. I think that's why she's so resistant to losing weight. We really abused her. I hope you don't make the same mistake when you're a parent. It was really wrong of us.""

Of course I won't. I'd be stricter since my kids are young to make sure they don't balloon into a [prediabetic, obese monster by their early teens.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/45m9a6/when_my_sister_was_told_she_may_be_prediabetic/?st=jj4fnraz&amp;sh=af30dd77) If you're curious about how I personally think my parents fucked up parenting my sister, [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/5xzonl/how_my_sister_grew_up_to_become_the_monster_she/?st=jj4fous7&amp;sh=047c27ba) the story.  

I tried arguing with my aunt, saying that I believe my parents' mistake was letting her get away with stealing food and overeating from young but my aunt was insistent that if they had just left her alone and let her do whatever she wants instead of making (weak &amp; late) attempts and getting her to lose weight, she would've realized fat is not beautiful and lost the weight on her own.

Yeah, no. She'd just be dead of an obesity related disease by now. 

**EDIT:** There seems to be a lot of upset people so let me emphasize that IN NO WAY was she forced to exercise. She had a choice. Shopping trips are a treat, not an entitlement and if she hated exercise so much, she could just say no to the shopping trip. My brother and I got the same treatment, we had to study/do chores before we got to go shopping/watch a movie, etc. We didn't cry about it.",Apparently making kids exercise counts as child abuse now
fatpeoplestories,"Not sure if this is the right place for it really, as I'm not really fat nor is this much of a story, but here we go.

I'm 5'8, 70kg (down from a high of 89kg in 2015) and have been trying to loose weight for quite a while.

To aid in this, I bought some digital scales.

On weighing my food the other day I was suprised to see how much 30g of cheese really is, it looked alot. Nevermind, not complaining!

After not managing to lose anything for the last year, it suddenly hit me. I took a 100g weight and popped it on the scales. Gave me a reading of 75g. Oh.

Turns out my scales have been under reading for god knows how long (I assume since I bought them?) which would really explain why, despite weighing everything I eat to the gram I've not been loosing anything even after staying within my daily calorie limit.

TL:DR - Have been overeating for up to 3 years. Check your scales.",An advisory - struggling with counting calories
fatpeoplestories,"Here is a tender FB morsel from a HAES activist person I recently met through a friend-- thought you might enjoy it.

HAES Activist acquaintance: **“PSA:IDC about your weight loss or diets or exercise routines. It negates your politics in my eyes, because for me fat is political af”.**

I’m pretty sure this is in part a passive-aggressive dig against me (maybe other friends on their list too). I will post my Fitocracy workouts and little observations and encounters at the gym. To me, this makes sense, because I spend about 8 hours a week or more, 4 days a week at the gym. It’s as integral a part of my life as my school and my job-- or my activism. Of course, I’m still fat-- so I don’t see how my gym habits negate fatness as a political identity-- unless you want to actually begin admitting that exercising is a way to address obesity, but that would ruin the “healthy at any size” mentality.

I get that I'm a dude and there are different standards I'm judged by. I hate that self-righteous bullshit masquerading as activism. On one hand, this person is going to gripe about how hard it is to get around-- how they want to use their cane to knock people out of their way, but then is so proud of being fat-- which exacerbates any physical issues they have. And because the bus system moved the stop a few streets over, they wants their job (she's a temp) to accommodate them.

But being bigger making it hard to walk when you already have some other issue-- that's not oppression-- that's gravity.

But obviously they’re not proud of being fat either, because for some reason, any marching done, any lettering campaigns, any standing up against racists is negated if you go to the gym, decide to explore the strange territory of complex carbohydrates, decide that you'd like to reduce your body's chance of developing a chronic and degenerative disease.

What about people for whom giving up the Standard American Diet (which does contribute to obesity if consumed at the calories we often do), is a form of decolonization? Or if they need to lose weight to qualify for an operation?

Like, I’m sorry, how the hell are we supposed to punch Nazis if we’re out of shape and uncoordinated? Racist militia groups and other White supremacist groups train their bodies to enact violence. I can't just throw online witticisms at them, maybe wave a sweaty, squishy appendage at them and hope they retreat in fear?  


It’s one thing for someone to not exercise, to not budget their calories and energy expenditures-- but somehow, only fat people can be truly revolutionary? Tell that to the starving proletariat that rose up against the Tzar during the Bolshevik revolution.

Oh, and the icing on the cake? They want a thin, good looking boyfriend ( ""with a concave stomach"" and ""no face that looks like a shoe"") who is submissive in the bedroom-- just for the contrast, you know?","""You can't be radical unless you don't talk about dieting, exercise, or weight loss."""
fatpeoplestories,"First time lurker, on mobile, yadda yadda.

Setting: My mom’s house, I don’t know why I was there, but me and my bf were waiting for her to come home. Since her bf was there and he is a genuinely nice, cool guy, it was cool to wait there with him.

Me: average not important 
My bf: thin also not important 
Mom’s bf: 5’6” 210 maybe? we are going to call him Fats for Fish And Tartar Sauce, you’ll see.

Mom works out very hard, she is part of a running group and has done 5k 10k half marathons and even fulls (go mom!), but she has a problem overeating. I think she knows it because Fats definitely has a problem overeating and she will call him out on it. He also has the Beetus. So I have heard him say he doesn’t want to exercise because his cundishun gives him pains in his legs and feet, I suppose there is truth in that but sitting on your ass won’t make it better. She just wants him to go on walks with her, not even a run a race. He on a reluctant occasion will indulge a brief walk.

Most of his brief walks are to the kitchen. Now Fats isn’t really terribly fat, but he suffers from fat logic. He does NOT do leftovers. And you are thinking “Well, some food doesn’t taste good reheated.” “It can be better to eat fresh food.” Ooohhh booooyy! When Fats says he doesn’t like leftovers, this means we don’t like to open a box of pasta and have pasta left over in the box. We need to cook all of it. And then we definitely need to eat all of it. With only two people at home, you can see how overeating is our main problem.

This particular occasion Fats didn’t have my mom home to say dinner will be soon, so it is time for a snack. Me and bf absently wait scrolling on our phones. And Fats returns from his brief walk, to the kitchen, with his snack, we were both rather surprised what he found to tide himself over.

Fats found some frozen fried fish, and cooked it up in the oven. It must have been a whole unopened box of fish because he came out to the couch with a full baking tray of this fish. If Fats had only ate a couple pieces or even half the box, then it probably would have gone bad. He sits the entire thing on his lap, hot and fresh and no time for a plate, and next to him he situates a jar of tartar sauce. A big one which at least he used a knife to spread a huge layer on each piece of fish, but he probably could have gotten away with dumping out a bit at a time. If we don’t want to dirty a plate, no since in dirtying a knife.

Now mind you this was a snack, and we don’t do leftovers. So we could probably share with our two guests. Haha, no. I have never seen Fats so focused. He didn’t even ask if there might be something else we would like. Which honestly, if I had been hungry, then I no longer was.


So let me know what you think of this story. A holiday is coming up. If you like it, I’m sure I will have new fodder after visiting with family.",Fats don’t do leftovers
fatpeoplestories,"Hi all, this is a mini tale/realization I had not even a half an hour ago that I just needed to share. I am 21 F, 5’3” SW: 220lbs  CW: 190lbs  GW: 140lbs.

Context: I have been actively trying to lose weight over the last year and have been pretty successful. I’m feeling better, I’m more confident in myself and it’s great. Even at my biggest I never subscribed to HAES crap (doctor mom would never allow it) and I grew up with parents who were constantly cooking healthy and encouraging exercise in a way that never put me down. That said, my younger siblings and actually very thin, so when I left for college the eating habits in the house changed. They bought more snacks, dessert became a more regular occurrence etc. I graduated in May and am now back in the house readjusting to living with my family after 4 years away.

Naturally, the transition has been tough. I’ve gained a few pounds and have started Keto as well as 1200 cal a day to rectify it.  

Main course: My dad comes home today with a box of a dozen Cannolis from Rispoli’s in Northern NJ. We are part Italian. We live in NJ. We fucking LOVE our cannolis. Unfortunately cannolis are not keto and therefore I could not have one. Now I didn’t immediately cry. But after sitting at the table and seeing every other family member eat one, I couldn’t help but feel like I just HAD to have something sweet. But we’re out of any ingredients that I could use to make a reasonably tasty keto dessert. Sitting at the table staring at my phone I start to tear up and I realize that if I had never seen the cannolis I wouldn’t even have considered dessert, but because my family had it, I had this overwhelming need to have some. As soon as I realized this, the tears of embarrassment be used of how stupid I must have looked started and I flew up to my room to try to forget about the tasty treats downstairs.

The lesson here lards and ladies is that sometimes the psychological effects of obesity are a lot longer lasting not than we think. Some people who react to food like addicts really are just addicts, who are just as embarrassed about themselves as we are about seeing it. Regardless it was a good wake up call and I’m heading out for a run.

fatpeoplestories,"Meet my older sister, who has just come back from college to visit us. Anytime she comes back from college, she miraculously gains about 30lbs... she was already morbidly obese, and is on the verge of serious health problems. But apparently she just has an extremely slow metabolism... she only eats an omelette with veggies for breakfast, a small veggie wrap for lunch, and sushi for dinner... nothing else. Sure, sure. Definitely.  So, she comes home and is put on a strict diet plan, cause, you know, we don’t want her to die. She also really wants to lose weight, which is good. So, she eats an apple for breakfast, some sautéed veggies for lunch, an apple in the afternoon, and some more steamed veggie at night. She does this for about a month, all the while ‘working out’, yet only loses... a pound in that 4 weeks. Guys, she had been eating around 500 calories a day... she should have lost like 16 lbs. Then, school ends for me, and I’m home with her all day while my parents are at work. I head downstairs, after our breakfast (she had an apple) to get a Diet Coke, and lo and behold, our slow metabolism victim has filled a mixing bowl with cornflakes and full cream milk. Yep, full cream. I ask her what she’s doing, and she says “I’m just incredibly hungry”. I say, “That’s a lot of calories. Maybe next time you could try cutting up some more fruit. Just a suggestion” and leave it at that. Her diet is her business. Then, 2 minutes later, she heads to the kitchen again, and eats 2 huge slices of bread topped with PB as a healthy snack.   Later, she goes to the mall with her friends. She boasts to the family that the only thing she ate was a frozen yogurt, which apparently had “zero calories”. Like lol, wtf? What kind of fro yo is this? And she probably covered it in M&amp;Ms and Oreos too.   My mom is kind enough to cook her dinner every night, since my mum works late and my sister, although being 21, can’t even cook a meal. She always eats like 4 slices of bread on the side of her dinner.   And her workouts, too. Once I was going for a walk in our compound (our house is part of a community of houses, with a shared gym) and I saw her through the clear windows of the gym, exercising. Quotes around exercising. She was on the exercise bike, peddling at like  half a mile an hour, while using her phone.   Then, she has to comment on our food. She says she eats fewer calories than everyone else in our family. To be fair, my dad does eat a crap ton at night- but that’s because he skips breakfast, rarely eats lunch, is on the move constantly, and then eats a lot at night. He’s a healthy weight. My mom eats junk constantly, but in small portions(like, two tiny cookies and a cup of green tea), and because she’s on her feet all day, doing housework, climbing up the stairs, vacuuming all day, etc. I’m skinny because I control my calories, even though I don’t move much.   The other day, she saw me eating 2 slices of toast with PBfit and banana and told me “You know carbs make you fat, right?” Like wtf bitch. You’re saying this to someone who’s at least 150 lbs lighter than you.   Sorry, rant over lmao",My sister has the slowest metabolism in the world
fatpeoplestories,"Hey everyone! I am here to tell an awful tale of my brother's gf

Be me: 5'7"", 125, very weight conscious. Former lacrosse player and current Miss USA girl. White. (Relevant)

Be, maybe, BF: 5'9"", 150, Lives in the gym, Korean (this is important), Visits me and stays the night at my apartment sometimes.

DO NOT BE: QueenWaffleStop, or Q for short. 5'3"". 220/250 pounds. Racist. White. Lazy as fuck.


So my brother has been with this girl a long time and we have all lived together about 2-3 years.

Now, I am very health conscious and so is my boyfriend. Of course I have cheats days, but I am definitely a restrictive eater usually (previous anorexia, current bulimia but I am trying to recover and seeking therapy for my BDD). 

Q is not. I don't care. Be as fat as you want. Just don't expect me to feel bad for you or believe the HAES bullshit. 



Q is, of course, very opinionated and verbal about her dislike for 'skinny bitches'. She loves to tell me how skinny girls (like me) dres so slutty yet she'll got outside in dental floss denim shorts and a bra. I don't care how people dress but don't comment on other people if you dress exactly that way.

She also wafflestomps. Legit wafflestomps. To the point that I have had to clean fecal matter out of the tub to use it when we shared a bathroom. Which, thank God, we no longer do. She insists that she never feels 'clean' if she just wipes. She has to hose it off in the shower.

She also loves to comment on my BF's appearance. How he's obviously gross because why would a muscular guy want a bag of bones? Why wouldn't he want to fuck someone 'soft'? This annoys him and I to no end.

Q also loves to steal food from us and leave a huge mess for me to clean. Now, if she was taking some food, I wouldn't mind, but no. She is taking enough to feed an army of stoners. Not only that, but her mess attracts ants. 

Not only does she steal food, but she labels HER FOOD with HER name so no one will eat it. Yet, I label mine and she steals it. Which she later denies and lies about eating anything of mine. A lot of my food is expensive because I have celiacs disease as well as a strict diet. She of course never pays or replaces anything.

Her HAES mindset is also something that starts fights between her and my boyfriend. She constantly says how she can't lose weight and that guys LOOOOOVE her HUGE ass. Idk how she brags about a big ass when everything on her is BIG, but whatever. She honestly thinks carbs will help you lose weight and refuses to exercise.

The racist remarks of course started up when we stopped buying any and all junk food for her to feast on at 3 am (she still eats most of the healthy food, but at least we get some). She started by calling him a 'fitness freak g**k' and saying 'ching chong' to his face. 


I am just glad that I am moving out and away from her soon. I might end up strangling her soon if not.

fatpeoplestories,"Hello! I do apologize for my absence, but I must admit I was so caught up in the attention my previous posts garnered that I posted many stories too quickly. Man, being famous is quite addicting, can’t get enough of being fanned by palm tree leaves and hand-fed grapes. But I’ve got some new stories lined up, hope you lovelies enjoy :)

This tale doesn’t come from my time as an EMS servant, rather from a time after my lower back said “fuck this noise” and went and got arthritis, preventing me from standing for more than 10 minutes without extreme pain. How rude. 

If any readers here are in the medical field but NOT a doctor/nurse/whatever, maybe you do medical billing, or you’re doing pre-med in college/totally unqualified to make any sort of assessment, you may be able to commiserate with the general public’s insistence on asking you every medical question ever. 

Ex gf and I lived next to 2 gay/poly (hoo boy there’s another story there) dudes who were...hammy. Hammy bo blammy ain’t-gonna-wear-no-shirt-maybe-I’ll-show-you-my-fanny (pls don’t). The younger of the two, henceforth known as YoungHam, developed a strange obsession with me. Could barely be seen outside without him assailing me with a 10 minute monologue about who-fucking-CARES.pdf

This culminated in him tapping on my car window as I was sitting in the drivers seat waiting for my car to warm up, at approximately 6am. Why was he awake? To make my life no longer worth living. 

What could YH want? Perhaps he wanted to say good morning, have a good day? OH NO, HA HA. NEVER THAT. 

Shirtless in all his glory, at least 8 inches of hairy stomach-tub hanging down over his shorts and pressing against the window (my teeny car is very low to the ground), he goes “hey sorry I know you’re about to leave, but could you look at this for me?”

He looked really nervous, so I assumed it was something wrong with his dog or apartment, so I said sure and immediately got out of the car. I stand up and look at him expectantly, to which he responds by LIFTING HIS STOMACH TUB UP, and says “hey can you bend down and look at this? It’s right underneath.”

Figuring since I’m already going to poison myself in about an hour, I humor him. He’s short, like 5’ even, and I’m 6’2”, so I have to crinkle my absurdly tall body down to the asphalt like a peasant in order to look at the crease where normal body composition gives way to tummy-tubba. 

Hooooollllyyy lord above, my first guess was extreme untreated psoriasis, my somewhat-medical mind recalculated, reaching a conclusion of ‘that’s fucking disgusting, that is likely contagious, get it out of my face before I die.’ Ever the public servant, I straightened up, smiled, and said, in my best customer service voice, “you need to get to the ER. NOW.” 

“Can you drive me?”

Oh I most certainly will not. I didn’t tell him at the time, because I know that ER staff hate nothing more than someone moseying in there and proceeding to tell the staff what exactly they have and not listening to anything else. Homeboy had staph, big time, and in no way was I getting that all over me pretty lil face. His was bad enough that it was teetering on a possible life-threatening situation. I implored him to drive his hammy self to the ER 2 minutes away. 

YH did go to the ER, and was given super strength IV antibiotics, and had to take pill ones for a long time after. 

He graciously kept me updated on the healing process by yanking up the flab-slab anytime he saw me, which I totally loved because it was summer/hellfire, and who doesn’t love the smell of bacteria growing exponentially within clearly unwashed ham-folds?

Super upset about the breakup that lead me to move away from the Hammy couple, but man, it is good to be away from YH and his various contagious Ham-diseases. ","Honey, I’m HOOOME! Former-EMS vs. A Ham: You’re an EMT, so Basically a Doctor, Right? WRONG."
fatpeoplestories,"So my best friend in the world lives in Colorado.  I went to visit her a and, while I was there we decided to go camping with her friend and his boyfriend.  The tale that follows is about our hike up a popular mountain.

Cast and Crew:

Be:  Castle, your protagonist.  26 years old.  5’ 8” ish and maybe 130 pounds.  She’s an avid hiker and runner.  Castle has a cundition - a still healing knee injury.

Be:  Bestie.  Castle’s good good friend. 5’ 1” and maybe 105 lb.  She can hike or climb basically anything.  Total badass.

Maybe be : Broseph.  Bestie’s close friend.  Hiker and craft brewer.  Ripped.

Heck, you could be : Max the Mountain Ham.  At least 300 pounds.  Says he is an expert mountaineer and camper.

Location : Big Nose Mountain, a mountain popular for runners and day hikers.  It takes a good hiker most of a day to “bag” the peak.

Before we get into the main course, let me offer you a few tidbits; odd things Max did that should have been a red flag.

We were camping near a small town and decided to just eat in town for dinner.  When planning where to go, Max suggested Taco Bell or McBeetus FOR EVERY MEAL.  He rolled his eyes when we suggested we go anywhere else.

We had brought two tents, one for Bestie and I and one for Broseph and Max.  When Bestie and I set up ours Max started in on how our tent was “easily big enough for the four of us.”  He lamented about being forced to set up a second tent when I told him, yes we could all barely fit, but why would we want to?

He brought SO MUCH FOOD.  When I saw his two coolers I reminded him that we had planned to eat in town.  He said “yeah, this is just soda and snacks.”

Now - onto the main course....

We decided to spend part of the second day hiking up Big Nose Mountain. As far as I knew, we were planning on hiking for a few hours and then coming back to swim in Big Nose Lake.  With that in mind, I packed one water bottle and no food.  I saw Max shoveling soda and candy into his bag, but paid him no mind.

We started hiking and it was hot as heck.  Broseph, being the fit dude he is, decided to run most of the way and meet us at the base later.  This left Bestie, Max, and I to hike together.  Max was jabbering excitedly about how he was excited to “bag” the mountain.  I rolled my eyes and ignored him.  The view was beautiful, and we eventually made it to a beautiful grassy knoll relatively high up.

After enjoying the view, Bestie and I prepared for the decent.

“What are you doing?” asked Max, horrified.  “We still need to bag the peak!”

I laughed.  Then I realized Max was serious.  

“I didn’t really bring enough food or water for that.” I said, “I thought we were hiking for a couple hours and then heading to the Lake.”

“Who cares about the lake?” asked Max.  “I want to bag the peak.  Besides!  I have plenty of food and drink to share.”  He opened his bag and showed me his collection of soda, candy, and chips.

“Uh Max?” asked Bestie, “Do you have any water.”

Max shook his head, “Nah, I never liked the flavor.  Besides, coke is better for hiking anyways, it keeps your sugars up.”

I looked at Bestie, incredulous.  She shrugged and mouthed “up to you.” Well folks, I am nothing if I am not competitive.  There was no way I was going to let this Ham go further than me.  I was pretty tired so I didn’t think he could get much further on candy alone.

We continued up Big Nose Mountain.  I sweated and did my best to ration my water.  I almost considered taking Max up on his soda offer but......I would rather die.  We took a break and I suggested again that we start our decent.  It was late in the day and with my knee, I am slow going down.

Max brushed me off saying “won’t it be so cool to tell your friends back home you climbed Big Nose Mountain.  Besides, you seem fine to me.  If you’re tired you can always have some of my snacks!  That always helps me!”

....I wanted to kill him.....

I pointed to a spot right where the trail ended and the true climbing portion began.  “That is as far as I’ll go.”  Surely the Ham had to give up before that?

We get to the spot and oh boy am I regretting all of my life choices.  If I had brought a knee brace, more water, and a couple of protein bars, then I could have raced this hammy monster to the top.....  Even Bestie looked tired.  But Max was cheerfully huffing and puffing and munching on some beetus-ey goodness.

“Whatcha say Castle?” he asked obnoxiously cheerily.  “You excited to bag the peak yet?”

“Look dude,” I said, giving in.  “I’m not prepared to climb that.  We’ve been hiking for 6 hours and I’m almost out of water.  I thought we’re only gonna be out here for a few hours and as such, didn’t bring a knee brace or anything.”

“Ohhhhh, you have a cundishon.” Max’s eyes widened.  “I didn’t know!”

We finally turned around.  Max tried to be helpful, offering to carry my backpack, offering me soda, and even offering to hold my arm on steep parts.  I declined.  He even “helpfully” suggested that if I gained some weight my knee would have more padding and I’d be able to do more hikes.  I overheard him telling Bestie he felt bad taking me up the hike in my “condition.”

Broseph was waiting for us at the base.  He was impressed at how high we made it.  We drove back to our campsite in tired silence.  We got there and I broke out the wine.  After talking for a few minutes, we decided to head into town to get some dinner.  We talked about where to go and realized Max was unusually silent.

“Max?” Asked Broseph

.....

“Max?”

He was dead asleep on one of our camp chairs.  After trying to wake him we thought it would be best to let him sleep.  We ended up going and getting takeout to bring back.  Max was thrilled when we came back.  After some drinking, even I caught on to his exuberance and cheer.

So Max, wherever you are.  I’m proud of you for how far you can hike.  That’ll show me for trying to compete with a guy just because he’s fat.  I don’t know how you did so well with only Beetus Juice and snacks to go off of but, good on you man.  

I hope one day Max realizes he can go even further once he starts taking care of himself.

Max, you’re gonna go far.

Edit:  I didn’t make this clear, I’m not calling Max an asshole.  If anything, I’m saying I was an asshole.  I’m thoroughly impressed by Max, it’s why I think this is such an interesting story.


TLDR:  Castle tries to get competitive with a generally nice, fatlogic spouting mountaineer. 

He powers up the mountain on candy and coke while Castle struggles behind him. Castle lives to tell the tale and be a bit less of a dick in the future.  ",Max the Mountain Ham - An Unlikely Tale
fatpeoplestories,"[We left off with Attila and her drunk friends bursting into my apartment screaming “party!”](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/8sub1i/invasion_of_attila_the_ham_part_2_scary_scary/) ....on a week night of course.

Be : Castle, 24, 5’8”, and maybe 145 lb. Your poor, spineless narrator.  She has a rad apartment, a snake, and a deep loathing of anyone in her space.

Be : BossLady.  Castle’s direct manager.  53, maybe 5 foot and 110 lb.  She’s a hard worker, a mom of 3, and the surrogate mom of all the tech geeks in Castle’s office.

Maybe be : Mr.  Hiss.  Castle’s garter snake and best buddy since college.  Age and weight unknown.

Don’t be Attila:  Also 24.  5’ 5” and maybe 215 pounds. Filled with fat logic and sells some stupid MLM product.  Has a baby, doesn’t know who the father is.  An invader, like her namesake.  

Probably don’t be: Genghis Kahn, Attila’s baby.  Honestly, I have no idea how old he was.  He didn’t really talk but he could toddle a bit?  He seemed fat but I can’t really tell with babies. 

Don’t be:  Drunko1 or Drunko2.  Attila’s wasted new boyfriends.

Don’t work for: BodyShit, Attila’s #BossBabe MLM.  

Now for the main course:  

Mr Hiss jumps off my shoulders in fright as Attila barges in.  He dives under the couch.  Honestly....I want to do the same.

“Shut the door!” I yell.  “My snake is loose!”

Attila screams and runs out the door.  

Drunko1 looks at me “I have a snake....”. He trails off and stares at the TV.

I give Drunko1 a glare, in case he’s making an innuendo.  I eventually pull a terrified Mr Hiss our from under my couch.  Immediately, both drunk guys crowd around me to look at him.  Luckily, since I got Mr. Hiss in college, he’s pretty used to drunks.  It’s a laughable scene, two drunk men telling Mr Hiss that he’s a “good shoelace” and Attila cowering in the hallway.

I put Mr. Hiss away in my room and Attila rounds on me.  “Stop flirting with them Castle!  Your weird snake is just gonna scare them off!”

1. I’m not flirting
2. My snake is awesome

I explain this to Attila.  I then go on to explain that; this is my apartment, and I am NOT having a party on a Thursday night.

“Your friends need to leave” I said.

“Castle!” Attila whines, “it’s just a few people!  You won’t even know we’re here!”

“Nope, I have work tomorrow.”
“Fine, Attila scowls.  “Will you at least watch Kahn?  You owe me for cockblocking me.”

“I want to sleep.  I’m not watching your baby.”

Attila stomps around for a minute before responding, “are you jealous?  I know I get so many men, but I can help you find someone.  You’re pretty, even without curves.”

“Attila, please get them out.”  I said.  “Tomorrow is Friday, we can do something then.”

Attila leaves my room and talks to the Drunkos.  Drunko2 yells “cool snake!” and they shut the door.  Attila comes back in my room after they leave.

“I think I’m going to bed too,” she said, “I might have had too much to drink.”

“It happens,” I said, relieved that she’s finally showing some sense.  “Sleep well.”

I got ready for bed and lay down.  I was surprised by how quiet Attila was being.  I chalked it up to the liquor and quickly fell asleep.

I woke up a few hours later to the ear splitting shrieks of a baby crying.  I put a pillow over my head and prayed Attila would shut him up......she didn’t.  I waited a few minutes longer and the baby kept crying.

I got up, praying Attila hadn’t died on my couch.

“Attila” I whispered, flicking on the lights in the office.

Kahn was sitting on the couch, but Attila was nowhere to be seen.  I checked the bathroom....nothing.

Flipping on the living room lights I saw that my kitchen cabinets were open.  Gone was my wine, my microwave popcorn, and my hidden Tequila.  Luckily, she missed the emergency Scotch.

With Kahn still howling in the background, I called Attila’s cell......it rang and eventually went to voicemail.

“Attila...” I growled.  “You stole my liquor, and you left me with your screaming kid.  You need to come back here.  That kid better not have shat himself because I AM NOT changing a fucking diaper”

I walked over to Kahn, who luckily, had not shat himself.  I bounced him a bit and he stopped crying so I put him back on the couch.  As soon as I got back to my bed he started howling again.

Mamaaaa!” He screamed

I grabbed my emergency scotch, and settled down on the couch with the kid.  He babbled for a bit longer, but eventually we both fell asleep.

When I woke up, Attila was still nowhere to be found.  I cursed the sun and the moon as I wondered what to do with this kid.  As it approached time for me to leave, I decided to call my manager, BossLady.  She was reasonable and would likely let me work from home.

BossLady told me if I wanted to come in, she would make sure someone kept an eye on Kahn.  I wanted nothing to do with the baby, so I readily agreed.  I brought Kahn into the office and BossLady LOVED him.  She let him crawl around her office, while I got some much needed peace and quiet.

Eventually, my phone buzzed.  I had some texts from Attila.
“Castle!  Let me in!” x3
“Castle where the hell are you!!!  Did you steal my fucking baby!?!?!?”

I walked down to the cafeteria and called Attila.
“Attila I’m at work.  Where the hell werre you?”
“
Where is my fucking Baby Castle!” screeched Attila. “I’m calling the cops you bitch!”

“You left him at my apartment all night.  I took him to work.  Please come get him.”

“Bring him here!”  Attila shrieked.  “I can’t leave my BodyShit conference!  You stole my baby!”

“What?” I asked.

According to Attila, she had stepped out to get some McBeetus because all I had in my house was “diet food” and her sugars were dangerously low. (I had 3 bags of chips but the bitch ate them). She ran into her friends, and when she came back a sensible few hours later and I had absconded to sell her baby on the black market.

When asked about the location of my wine and Tequila Attila suggested the Drunko’s had stolen it when I was “rude to them”

Eventually, Attila showed up at my place of work in Drunko2’s car.  She snatched Kahn from me with a glare.

“I thought I was going to have to call the police!” Attila snarled, throwing Kahn into the back seat.  I started to say something but they had driven off.

I was at home when Attila returned.  She wasn’t speaking to me but I watched in horror (and a little bit of awe as she ate two McBeetus burgers, a southwestern salad, twenty chicken nuggets, and two things of fries.  Kahn had his own large fry and they each had a large cup of Dr. Beetus.  She then left the entire mess on my counter and stalked off into my office where she preceded to have loud phone sex with.....someone.

I had had enough.

Once the phone sex was (finally) over, I knocked on the door and told her I needed to talk to her. I nicely, but firmly, told Attila I needed her to leave, and why.

I expected yelling, I expected her to storm off with some shitty boyfriend.

What I should have expected was tears.  She cried and whispered “I don’t actually have a ticket back.”

Ladies and gentlemen, I should have thrown her out......but this wouldn’t be a good story if I did the right thing.

I sat her down on the couch and asked what was going on.  Attila cried and told me her mother had kicked her and Kahn out and she didn’t have a place to go.  She had planned on coming to &lt;City&gt; to stay with her boyfriend but he dumped her.  She apologized for her behavior and said she was just so stressed by that, and she’s just been diagnosed with a new cundishion......

And folks......I fell for it..... hook, line, and sinker.....

UPDATE: Unfortunately, yesterday Mr. Hiss has away due to old age.  He lived a long life full of mice and cuddles.  He will be missed.",The invasion of Attila The Ham - Part 3 - Castle Steals a Baby!
fatpeoplestories,"So, to get it all out of the way: Long time lurker, first time poster. I think my formatting is okay, but please let me know if it isn't. Also, if this is something that shouldn't be posted here, or belongs on a specific thread, please let me know! I looked through the rules, and I think this should be okay, but I could be wrong! 

Be: A person of a healthy weight/height ratio, with a reasonable relationship to food. 

Don't be: Me, 165cm (5'4""), 99kg (220lbs), unrealistic about my weight issues.  

So, here it is. I'm a ham. Or at least, I was a ham. See, I've always been fat. Obese, really. My BMI is 36.6, I have terrible joint/back pain (and though that could be down to potential hEDS, the weight certainly doesn't help). My family is big, my uncle had a heart attack and dropped about half of his body weight, and he's still big. My dad is probably around 400lbs (but he's 6'6"", so it doesn't look as bad as it could).  

My relationship with food is terrible. I have no impulse control, and binge easily on sweets and fries and anything unhealthy I can get my hands on. I've been vegan for around a year, so that's greatly cut down on my options for binge foods, but still I find myself ordering 2, 3, 4 large fries when I go to McBeetus for lunch with my friends from college (I feel like they pay me just to spend my paycheck there, which is a pretty solid business plan as it seems).  

 I talk big about weight loss, too. I know all about CICO, portion control, and I'll track for a few days and then just stop because I'm lazy and unmotivated. I always seem to think that I'm not that bad, that I'm not really obese, my legs are just muscular from cycling (which I haven't done in years since the pain got too bad). If I'm not in college or in work, I spend most of the day in bed (and yeah, I have some pretty bad chronic fatigue and sometimes getting out of bed really is an impossible task, but I know that I'm using it as an excuse for myself). I don't really exercise (I started running, but had to stop after three weeks since my osteochondromalacia started acting up, but it's healed now and really I have no excuse).  I'm filled with excuse after excuse, each hammier than the last. I even tried to make my PCOS an excuse, which my mother backed me up with at the gyno. Luckily, the gyno wasn't having it, and told me weight loss was still an achievable thing with PCOS. 

But, I think I had an epiphany today. Maybe that's why I'm writing this, an admittance to my hammy ways. I'm addicted to food, unhealthy food, and I'm lazy, and if I carry on then I'm going to die. I was told when I was 15 that I could have a heart attack by sixteen (I didn't), and I've had Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver since I was 14. My liver function went as high as 280 (it's supposed to be around 30), and every time I see my GI Specialist or Dietician they tell me the same thing: exercise, lose weight. And I made excuses: I hurt too much to exercise, I eat hardly anything, nothing works. 

And yeah, it does hurt. And sometimes I can't get out of bed because I'm exhausted for no reason, and my joints just won't stop aching, and any movement of my back makes me cry out in pain, and when I stand up I go all faint and fall back down. But on the days where I can get up, where my joints hurt just that little bit less, then there isn't an excuse. I know, I'll probably be in a wheelchair before I'm 25 – that if I do have hEDS then it isn't something I'm going to get better from – but I can still do it now. I can walk now, I can run now, I can move. So, there's no reason for me not to exercise when I'm able.  

And I don't have to binge. I don’t have to have pizza three times a week because I can't be bothered to cook something (because when I cook it's healthy foods, and I track it and control my portions), I don't have to go to McBeetus for lunch when I can just make something to bring with me instead. I don't have to lie to myself about how much I eat, it isn't doing me any favours. I say I eat around 1500 a day, but today my breakfast was probably 700cal, and that's most likely a gross underestimation. My habits are so obviously ham-like, and even though I read this sub pretty much daily, I refused to see the ham-like properties I held. I'd say that I wasn't that big, that I wasn't that rude (which I stand by – I will never be as rude as the hamplanets we talk about here, and I can't imagine taking the attitude some of these people we talk about do), that I didn't talk about Mah Condishuns as an excuse. But I do. Perhaps not to the same level, but I display all the common traits of a Ham.  

But today, it stops. I'm going to track religiously, I'm going to restart the C25K programme, I'm going to bring my own food to work and college, I'm going to stop ordering so much takeaway. Because I'm 5'5"" and 220lbs, I'm obese, and it is going to kill me if I don't do something.  ",The Unacknowledged Ham Within
fatpeoplestories,"I posted this first in /r/fuckyoumorgan about my roommate “Morgan”, but I thought you guys might enjoy it too.


If you’d like to have a stroke at age 28 and weigh about 300 lbs at 6 foot, follow the Morgan Diet. Here’s how:

Go to Whole Foods and buy lots of brightly colored and expensive organic vegetables. Place them in the fridge to rot until they’re just brown smears on the shelves. Repeat indefinitely.

Purchase whole boxes of oranges and tangerines. Allow them to become Petri dishes for penicillin. When your roommate throws them out, have a giant tantrum and say you planned to use them in old fashioneds. 

Have $300-$400 dollars worth of Omaha steaks delivered monthly and put them in the freezer until the door won’t close properly. Allow the entire freezer to defrost and meat-blood to leak down into the fridge (onto your organic veggies) and all over the floor. Clean nothing.

Make various “German specialties” that in no way resemble the actual food. To make “spaetzle”, mix water, flour and salt together and roll it into large balls. Now boil them and pour half and half over the finished flour balls. When told this is not spaetzle, throw another tantrum and incite your “radical feminist” prison guard friend to call your roommate an “ungrateful cunt”.

Eat approximately 2 wheels of triple cream (75% butterfat) cheese a day, interspersed with various cured meats, sausages and massive kosher pickles. Make a point of telling everyone this is what German people eat everyday and it’s very healthy. Ignore the fact you have diabetes and numerous other health conditions caused or exacerbated by obesity. Blame that on “high fructose corn syrup” and “Monsanto”.

When you’re feeling adventurous, cook flour balls in bacon fat. Make sure it entirely covers the stove, adjoining countertop and wall behind the oven. Scrape that grease off and put it in a Tupperware to save for later. Do not wipe anything down because it’s just going to get dirty again anyway, right?

Finally, eat everything your roommate cooks (without asking) and then complain it has “too much flavor”.

Congratulations, you have created a breeding ground for any number of food borne illnesses and have the whole fridge to yourself!

Bonus points if you periodically run your finger through the rancid bacon grease coating the stove and lick it. ",The Morgan Diet
fatpeoplestories,"This is actually 2 mini stories in 1. And both took place earlier today.

Thanks to my last post we have all learned that Rockstar has vitamins. But today we will have lessons on how to make your workout count, and healthy eating on the go.

Story 1: How to Make Your Workout Count

Me: F 5'6"" 26, down to 155lbs from 190lbs in January. I have a ways to go, but overall I'm no longer what most people would consider fat. Just squishy like your average office worker.

Gym Ham: F 50s, probably around 280ish. Seated so height was impossible to guess. Not the world's largest, but at least class 2 Obese.

I get to the gym. I want to get into shape for a triathlon, but I've been skipping the gym since my wedding 2 weeks ago so I also want to ease my way back into my training. I head upstairs to do some bricking and find a free upright stationary bike. 2 bikes down on a reclined bike is Gym Ham, she is barely peddling and messing about on her phone.

I start my music and select the 15 min pre-programmed interval training, my goal is to complete the whole thing while maintaining 115rpm. I pay very little attention to Gym Ham but I glance around a few times and she's still barely peddling and on her phone. Once I was done I switched immediately to the treadmill in the row in front of the bikes, this time for a 15 min interval run. 

Since I'm easing back into exercise I've already decided not to finish with my normal lap swim so I walk over to the stretching area which is directly next to the Gym Ham. She's still basically sedentary and is chatting away on her phone, which doesn't really matter because we're the only two people there. I take my ear buds out because I like to stretch and relax and focus on breathing to finish, when I hear; 

""I mean I don't come to the gym to lose weight because I love my curves, but I just don't understand how I can slave away for over an hour while these skinny girls barely do anything and stay so slim. I wish I could only workout for 10 minutes and be thin. It's why they're all so full of themselves even though it's all genetics"". 

Nothing juicy happened after that, she just kept complaining loudly on the phone, while continuing her ""workout"".

Story 2: Healthy Eating on the Go

New Characters Arriving Soon

Tumblrina Ham(TH): F ~25, 5'4""ish, 350lbs. Also featured neon pink hair with all the sides shaved. 

Granny Ham(GH): F ~65, 5'2""ish, 280lbs. 

Downtrodden Entourage: included fat but not rude Mother and Father of TH, Grandad and husband of GH also fat but not remarkably so, and brother of TH who seemed in relatively good shape compared to his family.

When I get back to my car from the gym I notice my husband has requested food. He's about to enter starvation mode, and we can't have that(jk). So I decide to go to Mod Pizza because I love their portion sizes and how easy it is to fit into my vegan diet.

For those of you who do not know what this chain is, think slightly upscale Subway but for pizzas. They sell mostly smaller pizzas, but I believe you can get family sized ones as well. You have a large selection of sauces, cheeses, meats, and vegetables that you can have, and then they put your pizza in a brick oven that you can watch. Your pizza can range from 300cal up to 1600+ depending on your choices. They also make salads.

Mod Pizza is slammed when I get there, but it wasn't until later I realised why they were so behind despite having lots of open tables. Regardless I'm in no rush so I don't mind waiting in line. 

Now just like many other restaurants of similar operation, the line forms against the wall to one side with seating, neatly separated by a pony wall, in the middle of the room. There's a large table with chairs on one side and a booth against the wall on the other side which had another table joined up to it that could have easily sat 10 overweight adults, snugly but still it had plenty of space. Because the line was moving very slowly I was standing directly on the other side of the pony wall from this table. 

I see GH and TH waddle towards the table, they had apparently claimed the table in advance by leaving one of their cell phones on the table. Both of them start bickering over who had to sit in the booth. With TH dramatically stating that she would sit there despite how little room there is because someone must sit there(it's a moveable table btw). To which GH stated that was ridiculous ""make your parents sit there they're skinny."" TH had already squeezed herself in however and simply said that it'd be too hard on her to move now especially with such low sugars. GH concedes this and plops on 2 chairs, which is impressive because she really didn't seem to need both. 

Now seated GH and TH start huffing and puffing about how their Downtrodden Entourage had yet to deliver their food or drinks. Turns out the rest of their family was actually still ordering because they in fact wanted to eat too. Since it was a relatively large group the grandfather came over to make sure he knew what they ordered do he could pay the cashier while their pizzas were cooking. Oddly being asked what they'd ordered seemed to be a landmine for this poor fellow which came with both of them barking their orders at him and demanding to know why they didn't have their drinks and food yet. GH noting that they both ordered salads and medium pizzas and they should at least have their salads(they hadn't paid yet though). Her husband quickly retreated back to the cashier to get the salads and drinks.

About 30 sec later GH and TH actually RIP their salads out of the hands of their entourage members whining about how poorly they were being treated. TH takes a drink and immediately spits it out crying out ""why is it so sour?"" Apparently it was half lemonade and half punch like she asked for but her father neglected to put in the extra sugar packets like she wanted. He wordlessly went to fix her drink. 

About this time GH discovered that there were only 2 sides of ranch between her and TH(for a small side salad each mind you) and that this was absolutely unacceptable. They couldn't possibly share so little for their salads. They needed at least 4 more sides of ranch. Their family however was busy picking up pizzas from the window, getting drinks, utensils, etc. So their salads had to wait for more ranch.

Well apparently 3 min was too long of a wait because halfway through me ordering my food GH pushed me aside in the middle of ordering to demand the ranch. And not only did she demand it, she wanted it brought to her table because how dare they try to skimp her on her beloved ranch dressing. Having been interrupted in the middle of putting my topping on the pizza the employee just looked at GH in shock. GH just reiterated that the ranch must be brought to her immediately and then stormed back to her table.

As I was leaving with my pizza in hand I witnessed GH and TH both pour 4 sides of ranch into their side salads, with TH stating ""the discrimination against fat people is unbelievable, even when we order healthy food they just try to judge us for wanting dressing on our salads!""",Hammy Double Whammy
fatpeoplestories,"I go to hot yoga regularly, but am by no means a regular yogi. I'm just a decently practiced amateur and I really get a lot out of the practice, and I go about once a week. I've been going to the same studio for several years and am on friendly head-nod terms with most of the staff and regulars. 


This week there was a rather large woman in the class, right in the front. Not 300 pounds, but big enough that her shape impeded her movements. I knew right away that she had never been to a yoga class before. She came into the studio and made a big deal out of rolling out her obviously new mat (you can tell how it sticks, curls, and smells) and trying to strike up conversations with the other yogis. There's no sign or anything that says you can't do this, but it's pretty uncool. We're all sitting quietly doing poses or trying to get our zen on. 


Yoga appeals to people of all ages and sizes because of possibilities for modification, a more nurturing atmosphere, and focus on listening to the body. HOT yoga appeals to a lot fewer people because you're doing all that in a 90+ degree room. In the years I've been practicing, I've seen a great many people of size come and go, but they usually at least try the poses and the flow.  There are ""stability"" classes which are recommended for beginners and where I do see larger people, and ""flow"" classes, which are usually fine for beginners but involve continuous movement and not a lot of time for modification. I'll say that this is true for this studio and each studio operates a little differently, but this difference is really very clearly marked in the class descriptions that accompany the schedules. 


The instructors tend to be pretty hands off, which I personally like. Unless someone is at risk for injuring themselves, they don't fuss too much over minor adjustments and speak the guidance as a general advice to the class, not to one person individually. They do intervene if there's a problem or an unsafe pose, and they regularly remind students to return to the rest poses when necessary. 


This one ham had obviously never attempted a yoga pose before. I wondered why she chose a hot flow class for her first one, but chalked it up to ignorance and focused on my practice. She clearly had no idea what she was doing but hey. Everyone has a first class. 


She seemed to be attempting the first few poses and settling on mods. No big deal. By the third pose she was gesturing for the instructor to come over and deal with her personally (I could see this due to the mirrors) and the instructor was demonstrating nearby, but was continuing to wander around as necessary for the rest of us in the class (probably a dozen people total.) 


After not receiving the 1:1 help this woman apparently thought she deserved, the ham kind of started doing her own thing. The best way I can describe it was a cross between tai chi and interpretive dance. She was kind of flailing and maybe stretching, but it was hard to tell. Either way it involved huge gestures and was very distracting. There's no clock, but it had to be 3/4 of the class that she went on like that before settling down into shavasana at the end, which is basically laying on the floor. 


That was weird, but not as weird as what happened next. We all toweled off, some folks hit the lockers to shower and change for work. I took a little time and did some extra stretching (sore from starting weight training) and left the hot studio after everyone else.


The ham was chewing out the instructor in that kind of whisper-yell that moms do. I don't know how the conversation started but here's how it ended: 


Ham: You said this class was for beginners! 

Yoga Instructor: You said you had taken yoga before and we do often have.. 

H: I have taken yoga!

YI: ...well I'm sorry you didn't like this particular class. Maybe you'd enjoy the stability class better?

H: That's for babies!

YI: No many people practice in the stability class for years. It's a great place to learn and practice fundamentals. 

H: I do not need to learn fundamentals! I know them! This is YOUR fault for not showing me how to do it.

YI: We do offer personalized yoga sessions, but I'm sorry in a large class like this we can't focus on one student. I have to make sure everyone in the class is safe. 

H: Well obviously those skinny women don't need you to make sure they're safe. I need your help more because I have more adjustments. 

YI: Well I have-

H: And why was it so HOT in there?

YI: We're a hot yoga studio...

H: No it was ESPECIALLY hot. Big women are already hot, we don't need it hotter.

fatpeoplestories,"I'm going to talk about a good friend of mine. I met him on the first day of university and we are still good friends. 

Be me: 190cm (which means 6ft4 I think), 100kg (220lb) but a real show stopper at the time. Very well built, rippedish, Jiu Jitsu athlete and ""rich"" (not really, but every one thinks so) 

Don't be A: 175cm (no idea how many ft) and 135kg (297.624 lb), round as a ball and uses very VERY tight T-shirts. 

So we hit it off pretty well, he's very cool and at first doesn't exhibit fat logic. During the first day he somehow told me that he's fat because of hormones problems but no matter how many different medics he goes to, no one seems to be able to pin point the problem. I feel bad for the guy.

Fast forward to the next week, when real classes begun, we go to have lunch together in a restaurant that you get a plate, serve yourself from a buffet and then weight your food. My food weighted at about 400g and cost me R$9,00 or something (US$3,00). His food, though, weighted, and I shit you not, over 2kg. He payed about R$60,00 for it (US$20,00). I led it slide because we are not intimate enough and I didn't want to get lectures about muhgenetics. 

A couple months go by and we have a barbecue. Everybody is pretty drunk and I find him sobbing in a corner. I ask him what's wrong and he confess to me about his hormone problem being made up (no joke dude. Really? Couldn't even tell by how little you eat.) And that he's sad that now that he's in college he won't be getting any pussy, and that I'll have all the pussy in the world (spoiler alert: one, I'm really awful with girls and the one who had the balls to be blunt enough for me to catch on I ended up dating up to this day ) because of how women would act/look towards me and it didn't help that even the ones that didn't care for looks would go after me because of my money. And he goes on and on about how lucky I am to be able to pay for a diet (?) Because it's expensive and bla bla bla and that he would never get laid, because not only he's fat but also poor and says that with my car he could have anyone he wanted. It sure didn't help that his shirt were so tight you could see every contour of his very round body.
 
I talk him into his senses and get him hyped up saying we would run and go to the gym everyday after class, he'd get very hot and then he would be able to have sex all day long.

So we do it: every day we warm up by walking/running 3km, work out and walk/run another 3km. I teach him everything I know about losing weight and working out. He's really trying. Fast forward three months and... Nothing. He hasn't lost anything, just Gained muscle (and weight) but his bfp went up, meaning he was gaining fat too. I call his mom to investigate. Well, apparently he only do what I tell him to do when I'm around. Around me he's all like: diet and exercise. During weekends and when home alone he's all like candy and cake. No wonder it had no effect. 

I gave up on him then. Said we could try again when he was willing to, but I was not going to keep dabbing on ice. He got upset with me (?) and left, we didn't talk for a month.

I have many more stories to tell, but this is the end of this one right here. I'm gonna

Seriously thank y’all for the stories it reminds me that being fat sucks :) 

Will post once I reach my goal of ~240 pounds by next year :) ","Ham (me) denies being fat on this subreddit, realizes that yes I am fat and do something about it."
fatpeoplestories,"I'm probably gonna look like a real ungrateful disrespectful millennial in this story, but holy wowcow I can no longer suffer in silence. Here's the players:

be me, Middle: 25F, 125lbs, 5""2. My thighs do a lot of touching, but they also do some amazing long distance running. I work out usually twice a day, for an hour, and sweat enough that I have to lay my clothes over the edge of the tub.  I've actually got a half marathon in two days, and a few months ago, I accepted a side job as a women's group fitness instructor.

be Mum: 50F, 118lbs, 5""2. She's not got the muscle that I do, she's a little better about her portion sizes and works out usually once a day, sometimes twice. Actually is the one to introduce me to the fitness classes I'm now instructing, raised three smart, healthy, respectful, kind kids with a oft-away truck driver husband (he's an amazing dad he's just very busy) while getting a teaching degree with night classes. All three of us worked through college with scholarships and don't take anything for granted. She's amazing and gets genuinely embarrassed when people think I'm her sister, not her daughter. Started running a bit over a year ago, will be doing the half marathon with me- her first.

be'nt HamGram. 70F, 5""1, 250lbs. Emotionally abused my mother while raising her, often abandoned her, didn't allow her to have friends over, to cook, to do anything that would make a mess. Very old fashioned, catholic, you may have seen things from her over on good ol' insanepeoplefacebook posts. Infamously offered to babysit us grandkids exactly once while my mother was trying to take night classes, and hired the neighbor kid to watch us while she went out for cigars. Once owned a successful restaurant and fancied herself high class. Does yoga once every other week. Does a 2-mile walk twice a week that takes an hour. Thinks using oil instead of butter makes anything healthier. If you're not her, you're wrong.

The Scene: Christmas Day

HamGram arrives in a red and green leopard pattern windsuit that would suit me just fine if I needed to parachute out of a burning plane. Carrying a large, clattering, fancy pot/dish/thing that she hands off to Middle. Middle rushes to put it down in the kitchen and help gramp lug in a tote of presents that still smell like the Florida flea market she bought them at last year. Then follows a few more dishes. Mum notices. They'd had an argument a few days before that Mum was being health crazy by dictating what people should and shouldn't bring. It is Mum's house, not HamGram's house, so it makes sense, and it's Christmas, so there's always Way Too Much. HamGram has disregarded everything, and says she's being ridiculous and is trying to starve her kids. Grabs Middle by the arm. The double- and triple-rings on each finger pinch as she holds up my wrist and squeezes. She says Middle is unhealthy and would never survive if she got cancer. Uh. What? She continues to say Middle is unhappy and wasting away because Mum is controlling. Claims Middle never gets to eat her favorite foods under Mum's control, hence the extra dishes. She had to bring Middle's favorite. (Here, I am starting to sweat, because I've already had a huge Christmas-splurge breakfast and really don't want to have to eat myself sick to please HamGram.)

HamGram brought a fruit salad. Other gram had already brought a fruit salad, but HamGram says hers is better because she got discount berries at whatever-store and she saw on pinterest how someone used maple syrup *and* brown sugar on the fruit. But it's still fruit, so it's healthy. Middle makes the mistake of suggesting that fruit is already full of fantastic natural sugars, and probably doesn't need more added. HamGram talks over Middle very loudly, while already scooping a full plate of the syrupy gooey berry sludge. RIP the poor beautiful berries, they deserve better. RIP Middle. HamGram has also brought a layered veggie salad, further evidence of Good Health. Fat porky fingers, with the skin bulging around bracelets and rings and nails, picks several cut hardboiled eggs off the top and they disappear into the maw that is still talking. The gusts of hot air catch a few dry yolk bits and blow them into the air. HamGram points to each layer clearly visible in the glass bowl. Bottom to top: 1/2 inch lettuce. Kale (cannot be observed). 1 inch carrots. 1/2 inch cucumber. 2 inches peas. 2 inches corn. 2 inches mayonnaise- ""DR. TV SAID that full fat mayo is actually more healthy than light miracle whip, because it has NO ARTIFICIAL POISON INGREDIENTS."" 2 inches shredded cheese. 1 inch bacon bits. Sliced hardboiled eggs. Beside the salad is a two pack of Olive Garden salad dressing. ""THE REAL STUFF"". Middle reminds her ""I'm vegetarian."" She tells me to pick off the eggs. (because vegetarians can't eat eggs. they can eat bacon. HamGram fact.)

HamGram brought lobster stew. We all know that this involves 4 sticks of butter, a half gallon of heavy cream, and frozen lobster chunks.  There are ""HOMEMADE ROLLS."" There are bits of sticky white paper where she clearly ripped the ""Not Homemade Brand"" label off. Mum makes the mistake of pointing out the sticker. There is hollering. There are tears. There is no reason for hollering and tears and the cause is never clear. We move on. HamGram brought pineapple upside down cake. This entire cake is for Middle. Nobody is allowed to eat any. It has 16 pineapple rings on the top, that's how big it is. Middle hates throwing food away because it's wasteful and there are starving people in the world, so it's guilty bad feeling, but Middle will not even attempt to eat the entire cake before it goes bad. Now Middle gets the Christmas present of guilt and overeating all on one shiny plastic-metal dish already sopping with several centimeters of mysterious cake juice. (Middle prefers chocolate orange cake, or angelfood, or pie. Middle has never once in living memory said pineapple upside down cake is the best.)

Middle makes a big mistake. Middle often says things without thinking. Middle upset. ""HamGram, we can't possibly eat all this! Unless we want our big Christmas present to be diabetes and arterial stenosis."" It is said with a laugh. HamGram rounds on Mum. All four jowls are frowning.

""I AM JUST TRYING TO SAVE YOU. I HAVE TO GET HEART SURGERY. AND IT'S BECAUSE I'M UNHEALTHY."" The room is silent. Not a creature is stirring, not even a mouse. This is the first anyone has heard of this. Middle starts to wonder what's going on. Implied is that HamGram has realized her behavior has lead to an unhealthy heart, but the food brought suggests that she's not doing anything about it or isn't understanding her reality.

""I HAVE WORN OUT MY HEART. I JUST WANT TO SAVE YOU FROM MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES. PLEASE, MIDDLE, MUM, STOP EXERCISING."" Middle begins to worry she's dissociated or having a stroke. The lack of logic could only make sense in a dream. But no. This is a breathtaking display of ham logic that brings the immediate desire for lobotomization to all who hear it, so read on with caution.

The HamLogic Wheels Go Round and Rounder:

HamGram has never had health problems before, being sedentary, eating whatever she wanted without looking at ingredients or anything. 

HamGram introduced a change- adding short walks, adding twice monthly yoga, and paying attention to food. HamGram added walnuts to all her breads. HamGram used oil instead of butter. HamGram snacked on peanut butter cookies instead of chocolate cookies. HamGram used whole wheat flour and extra eggs in cakes. HamGram used Sugar In The Raw instead of normal sugar. HamGram ordered a side of coleslaw to go with burger and fries, for a healthy vegetable. Ate turkey burger once.

HamGram developed a problem with her heart and needs a replaced valve. Therefore, the change caused the heart problem. And because cars wear out and need replacements when they drive too much or drive too fast, so the body operates similarly. Middle and Mum are going to die early because of exercise, and healthy eating. They need to stop moving so much. They need to be less skinny, because DR. TV said that big strong people are going to live better than scrawny weak people.

HamDenial Ruins Lives:

HamGram's surgery is in two weeks. Mum has to put in for time off teaching, and gets chastised for not asking sooner. HamGram will not talk about the surgery. It is unclear what the surgery is even for. Middle and older sister ask her a lot of questions, both having degrees in biological engineering and having taken a number of medical physiology classes. HamGram sobs incoherently, sometimes will answer yes or no. The truth of these answers will be discovered in due time. Mum travels 4 hours with HamGram during a blizzard to get to the surgery. HamGram's denial was so steep that she did not book a hotel, and said she was going to have her family stay in the room with her. Mum rushes to find a hotel that still has rooms. The next morning, HamGram goes into surgery. Middle did not get time off work for this, and so receives a call from Mum early the morning of the surgery. Mum explains what the doctor told her. Middle translates. HamGram had said surgery would take a day, recovery two days, and then they would go to Florida like they always do in winter. Middle explains that HamGram is not, in fact, getting laparoscopic surgery, but is getting full open-heart surgery due to the interference from fat layers, and is getting an entire valve replaced due to stenosis from unhealthy fats and cholesterol. Middle explains that this will be a week long stay at the hospital followed by months of recovery. They will almost certainly not be going to Florida.

Mum gets in more trouble at school for extending her time off from two days to a week. Middle takes time off to help. HamGram refuses to acknowledge her deception and violently argues with the doctor all the time. Cries a lot, requests lots of carbs because her phone told her carbs are good for recovery. Says she's doing the Mediterranean diet because they live the longest, so she needs lots of pasta and oil. Middle and Mum fight, eventually give up. HamGram is an immovable object in willpower as well as physical magnitude. It is a very miserable start to the new year. HamGram to this day goes ballistic whenever Mum or Middle are doing any dietary improvements or exercising.

fatpeoplestories,"[We left off with Attila eating chips and begrudgingly sleeping on the couch.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/8gcoh5/the_invasion_of_attila_the_ham/)

Before I feed you, I’ll go over the basics again.  

Be Castle:  24 years old.  I have a job, a snake, and a pretty rad apartment.  5’ 7” and about 145 pounds.   I’m a runner and kind of a pushover.  Not rich, contrary to what Attila thinks.  

Be Mr Hiss : 2 years old and maybe 2 pounds.  He’s a snake and my best buddy.  

Don’t be Attila:  Also 24.  5’ 5” and maybe 215 pounds. Filled with fat logic and sells some stupid MLM product.  Has a baby, doesn’t know who the father is.  An invader, like her namesake.  

Probably don’t be: Genghis Kahn, Attila’s baby.  He’s probably one and a half in this story?  I guess that means hes a toddler?  

Don’t work for: BodyShit, Attila’s #BossBabe MLM.  Now for the main course:  

So I got up in the morning to find my kitchen an absolute wreck.  All three bags of chips I had in the pantry have been opened and mostly eaten.  There are chips strewn around.  My bottle of wine is in the sink and the cork has been partially gouged out with a steak knife.  “WINE OPENER!!!!” is written on my grocery list.  The door to my office is ajar and I hear snoring.  

Normally I go in there in the mornings and hang out with my snake but with Attila there I decided to just go into the office early.  

Work is uneventful until I get a text at about 11 am.  Our exchange goes something like this.  

A : Castle!  Where are you?!? 

C : At work 

A : Can’t you take today off?!? I wanted to hang out! 

C : I can’t.  Aren’t you supposed to be at the BodyShit convention? 

A : Yeah but I need someone to watch Kahn!  It’s not like you have a real job!  You work for your parents!  

At this point I can feel the migraine kicking in.  I work at the same multinational corporation as my father in a completely different department at an office thousands of miles away from him.  

C : I don’t work for my parents, I work for BigCompany.  I can’t leave work to watch your baby.  

A : Fine. 

... some ten minutes later ..... 

A : you need to buy more eggs.  I barely had enough for breakfast 

C : I thought I had 6 left?  

The rest of the day proves uneventful.  I come home and my apartment is a WRECK.  There are dirty dishes everywhere.  My refrigerator is empty, and partially open.  My freezer has also been raided and is totally empty - even the mice for Mr. Hiss are gone.  My new tub of ice cream sits melting in the sink.  3/4 of it has been eaten.  Additionally, my grocery list (whiteboard on the fridge) has been “updated” with everything from “MORE ICE CREAM and baby food!” to “WHY THE FUCK ARE THERE MICE IN THE FREEZER!”  

I saw red.... luckily for Attila all I could do was passively text her.  

C : Attila... you left a huge mess in my kitchen.  I don’t mind you using my stuff, but I would appreciate you cleaning up after...  also, I can’t buy you groceries.  Doesn’t your conference provide meals?  

A : I missed breakfast and I didn’t have time to clean up.  The meals here are tiny anyways.  I could barely sleep because your couch was so small and I missed my alarm.  I didn’t eat much anyways.  You’re rich, you can afford it.  Besides, I bought you dinner last night!  

I put my phone down and cracked open a beer.  After playing with Mr. Hiss for a while I started to clean up.  

Halfway through cleanup I got this text.  

A : also, why the fuck do you have mice in the freezer?  I threw them out because....gross 

C : they’re for my snake.  I’d appreciate it if you’d replace them. 

A : you have a snake!?! What the fuck is wrong with you Castle! 

C : he’s in a tank in my office.  His name is Mr Hiss. 

A : YOU LET ME SLEEP IN A ROOM WITH A SNAKE?!?!? What if it bit Kahn!?!  I can’t stay in a room with a snake!!!! 

C : I understand if he makes you uncomfortable.  There’s a great hotel down the street. 

A : WTF NO!  What kind of host are you?!? Get rid of it!  

I didn’t respond.  She went on the call me all sorts of names that I won’t repeat here. 
Eventually she said  

A : at least give me your room. I need to keep Kahn safe.  And your couch wasn’t built for curvy women.  

I gave in a little bit and told her I would move Mr.  Hiss’s tank to my room.  Attila didn’t respond and I had a pleasant evening.  (Drinking beer and playing Dark Souls with Mr Hiss on my shoulders)  

I had just gotten ready for bed when there was what sounded like a stampede of cattle at my door.  I tried desperately to ignore it but the stampede started yelling “Castle!! Castle!! Open up!!!”  

I opened the door and Attila stumbles in, barely clutching Kahn.  With her, are three overweight gentlemen.  If I remember correctly, one was wearing a fedora, but my memory could be biased.  

“CaAstllLLleeeEEee!!” slurs Attila.  “I found some friends!!!!!”  She plunked Kahn down on my couch.  “Let’s paaaaaaaaarty!!!!!

In the previous episode we met AJJ, the ham I sometimes see at the convenience store I go to nearly every day, telling me about how Almond Joys are healthy and she is dieting. She also got angry at me for refusing an almond joy (that i would have to buy). I promised if something else happens I would bring the second chronicle. So this is what just happened.

Don't be Almond Joy Jigglypoof (AJJ): 250-300lb fellow customer I see at the convenience store.


Time for the tale. (This happened a few hours ago)


So recently I cut my gums on some chocolate (I store my chocolate goodies in the freezer like a dumbass) so I decided to get some ice cream from the store. It's been hard for me to eat stuff other than cold, soft things, so im kinda limited on food, unless i bare the excruciating pain of eating solid stuff. 


I head to the freezer section to get my beetus cream when low and behold, AJJ was there before me. When I see her, she usually uses the hand basket, but this time she had a cart.


This cart was filled nearly to the brim with cookies, candy, sweets, and a few regular items like paper towels n shit. And of course, the almond joys. But she was now stuffing it with ice cream. 


She turns to me and immediately makes a grotesque face. Doing my best to remember the conversation, here it is:


AJJ: these were on sale for my family. (cough cough belly cough)


Me: alright... well excuse me? (I bend down to grab the last ice cream of the bottom shelf)


Alright, this ice cream freezer isn't that big. And AJJ has taken nearly everything. The ice cream I'm grabbing is one of the last ones. 


AJJ: WOAH. What are you doing!?!?


Me: (stands up with my sugary death) grabbing an ice cream


She fucking SWIPES the ice cream from my hands.


AJJ: hey! I was here first! I needed this one for the sale!


Me: but you have plenty? (She had over a dozen, no joke)


AJJ: I was still here first! 


She smirks and throws the ice cream in the cart, little did I know this was one of the watery cheap brands that have little protection on the case, because it opened up and SPILLED everywhere.


She glances at the cart and it's like she just witness the closing of the tastycake factory. With the most pouty, snarly squeal that came out of her boiling face, she takes the almond joys out of her cart and THROWS them at Me! 


She fucking chased, she. fucking. CHASED. ME. Im 15 and she looks almost 30, and she is started chasing me while throwing candy at me. She only got like a few feet when she stopped though. I didn't have anything store stuff on me so I ran out of the store. 


Luckily my mom bought me something from the ice cream truck because holy shit that was terrifying. My mom won't let me go there for awhile, so I won't have another story until I'm allowed back. Rip any outside time that I get.


Edit: A few got removed for skeptism, I admit I did emphasize on the chase when she only chased me a few feet, so don't think she was chasing me all across out of the store, just a bit down the aisle.",The Almond Joy Jigglypoof Chronicles Chapter II - The War Begins
fatpeoplestories,"I ended up getting roped into taking her to the store. Now I don't are if I sound coldhearted. She was never a good mothers, very vindictive and petty all my life. 

Well first was trying to squeeze her rotund frame into my small car, she had to almost try to roll herself onto the seat. Then complain when she could not get the door shut, because all of her curves were not completely in the car. 

Then we reached the store, I had to drop her off at the entrance and go park, since walking from the parking lot was out of the question. When I made it back to the entrance there was a line of people waiting to get in. It is a small rural store with only one entrance with a very narrow aisle. Hamplanet was slowly waddling down it, causing a traffic jam. When it widened enough people were going around her, she snarled at them. Up and down every aisle she waddles, causing backups. She crashed her cart into displays, knocking items off. She would just chuckle and keep moving on. I did clean up after her, feeling so embarrassed. She holds retail worked in such contempt because they are not superior like her and her siblings. Even though none of her family can even hold down a job for a few weeks. They either quit, get fired, or end up getting arrested. 

She loaded her cart with junk ""Something to munch on, something to nibble on"" And you can not talk to her about it. She will get violently angry and scream that her weight is 100&amp;#37; out of her control. Threatening to hit, claw, and punch people in the face.

fatpeoplestories,"First post here. Yay!

Homo\-Me: 28M, 5'10""  162 lbs (179 cm, 73 kg). Ex\-fat \- I used to be 220 lbs/100 kg

Homo\-Ham: 26M, 5'7""  235\-250 lbs  (170 cm, 106\-115 kg)

So I am visiting Tokyo, as one does.  Being a homosexual degenerate ( ;p ), I feel the 'call of the wild' every so often.  To Grindr, lads!

I find a decent British guy. 5'7"", ""average"" build, cute face. He can hold a conversation and informs me that he's an eager bottom.  Boom!  Awesome! His hotel is nearby, to boot.

I pull on some clothes and go for a wee wander to his hotel. So far so good. I got straight up to his room at 1611. He pulls the door open.

So. Much. Disappointment.

The first thing that catches my eye is his desk. It is an amply laden Beetus\-Buffet with chocolates, snacks, and other sweets to an orgiastic quantity suitable for a latter\-day Augustus Gloop.  I am not even counting the red slaughter that was the pile of dead wrappers.

My gaze darts to my tryst\-friend for the evening.  ""They've brought a cave troll"" sentiment isn't quite a great start. Having been what the airlines call a Person of Size, my vestigial pity overwhelms my contempt at deception. I suppose his ""average"" body type designation on the app was in consideration of the customers at a Biloxi, MS Wal\-Mart?  His pic was about 2\-3 years and God\-knows\-how\-many\-liters\-of\-soda ago.

I realize that my brain probably would not be handling this, leaving the work to the base of the spine (auxiliary control of sexual function, for men). I just wanted to get through this without traumatizing either of us (it can be brutal for a hook\-up to walk out on you).

We get down to making out.   I find that despite having 3.5"" in height on him, it's quite an effort to arch over him to make out.  I forgot the contortions involved in copulating with hams.

His kissing skills left much to be desired. I've ho\-ho'ed around the world, yet I've never encountered someone whose idea of a kiss involved a gaping, oval mouth that doesn't move with no tongue action. All I could think was ""is there anything more to this guy than being an insatiable hole/maw in every modality?! Should I have brought a pie to shove in there?""

By some fell sorcery or perhaps some embedded instinct that allowed my Homo Sapiens ancestor to bang my Neaderthal ancestors, I was physically ready to move on.

Eventually, desiring a meatier snack, the Homo Ham goes down on my Happy Sausage. I hoped that this might keep him on task, as he was quite a talker, breaking the flow of ""action"" to ask random shit about my life.  Mid\-BJ, he asks me about work.  As a freelancer going through an annoying patch, I hate this. I give short answers, and his appetites eventually got the better of him.  ;D

Foolishly, I make an attempt at sexy\-banter.  I asked him when he last had a good sausage supper.  This is a standard banter joke when I am feeding my man\-wurst to a Brit.  A sausage supper is a chip shop (fast food) favourite \[ ;) \], and the double entendre *usually* isn't lost on the lad.  Hot Scottish Guy a few days befor just gave me that ""evil, sexy, funny"" look unique to someone on their knees and eagerly devoted to their job.

Homo Ham gives me a literal answer and starts waxing poetically on the chip shops of Cardiff. Oh motherfucker. My mood is basically dead, and my hole\-stretcher is struggling to retain tumescence at this fusillade of turn\-offs.

After one last hurrah licking my popsicle, he decides that he is in need of hydration.  Pour himself a glass of water? Oh no, dear (and likely now thoroughly traumatized) reader.  He produces a 2 liter bottle of Grape Fanta Beetus \- ""We don't have this in the UK."" *Like you need it, bro.*

Fortunately, I kept this part brief, as I had no desire to explore his antifreeze/grape\-flavored Sarlacc\-esque oral cavity with my poor tongue.

He decides to regale me with more stories of his life, for some reason.  I don't mind a chat before or after, but this ""mood breaking"" with a stranger destroys the rhythm of the whole thing.

He takes another swig of Grape Beetus before trying to rally softening pork\-sword.  Mr McHappy didn't like the unsettlingly cool mouth. He promised joy when I topped him.

Oh hell no.

Blessedly, I had an appointment at 10:30 pm I needed to get back to my lodging for (late night soiree for my hosts' friend).

fatpeoplestories,"So this is a story that happened awhile ago, my then-boyfriend and now husband and I were grocery shopping. I won't lie my hubby and I are not the slimmest of people, but we're not massive either, my husband is about 5'11"" and 200lbs and I'm 5'6"" and probably about 180lbs at the time.

We weren't doing a full shop, I think we were just getting some frozen pizza and some caffeinated goodness in preparation for a night of some good ole cancer causing League of Legends. We picked our pizzas, I grabbed coffee and my husband grabbed a 4 pack on Monsters to get through the weekend, and we shuffled towards the checkout. This particular grocery store was in a somewhat weird location and rarely busy so they usually had no more that 2 clerks working, on this particular evening there was only one checkout line so we get in line. A few minutes later I hear some heavy wheezing sounds approaching from behind.

I turn to look because the wheezing is so loud, and I immediately try to turn back around in order to avoid ending up staring at the Hamlords in line behind us. It was 2 guys, one was about my height and probably about 300lbs and the other was about my husband's height and 2-3 times my husbands circumference. And to top it off they were wearing fucking fedoras over greasy ponytails, their faces were glistening with grease and were badly in need of some acne treatment, complete with black trench coats... lord have mercy on me I know it's not right to judge a stranger but I was hardly expecting to have a close encounter with Hamlord neckbeards in real life.

My husband hasn't noticed them just yet as he's busy putting our groceries on the belt. But as he's placing his Monsters on the belt we both hear, ""I only drink Rockstars because they have vitamins in them"" from behind us. The shorter Hamlord gave us a superior look as he finished saying this. My husband just froze, I could tell he was attempting to compose himself from the absurdity of what he just witnessed. The Hamlords clearly misjudged the silent stare as interest, rather than about 3 sec from my husband trying not to have an aneurysm in public by performing the necessary mental gymnastics and lack of self awareness he'd just encountered, and the taller one proceeds to follow up with, ""yeah Rockstar is soooo much healthier for you"". Mind you their cart is piled high with cookies, sodas, chips, if it has no nutritional value and is high in calories then it was probably in their cart... 

At this my husband has reached mental overload and proceeds to cut of the shorter Hamlord saying something else about his superior nutrition by just silently turning to face dead ahead. At this there was much puffing and wheezing at this from the 2 Hamlords but my husband acted like he heard nothing, at this point I would like to say something more happened but the Hamlords just continued to act like affronted health gurus, we paid and left.

Though to this day, about 3 years after the Hamlord incident, if my hubby ever asks for a Monster I can't help but remind him that ""Rockstar has vitamins thoughhhh""",Vitamin Conscious Hamlord
fatpeoplestories,"Hey guys, its been a while since I last uploaded something here! So I figured I would tell a story about  something that happened at work a few months ago. 

Be me: 17 M, recovering anorexic. 5'6"", 125 pounds. 

Probably dn't be: my manager. 5', 250 ish pounds. Pregnant and hormonal.

So for context, I work at a fast food place. And during our breaks, we can get a free burger and fries, or a free garden salad. Anything else we want is half off. The whole time I worked, I typically just got a side salad, or nothing at all. 

Our location typically gets small bursts of people coming and going, so when we had a bit of down time, I put in my order for my break. I just got an order of fries, which was a pretty big deal for me. I hadn't had fries in at least a year and a half at this point. And I figured that part of recovery was eating foods that scared me. I was anxious about it, but tried to ignore it all. 

So right as my food was ready, we experienced a mini rush, lasting about 30 minutes. So my fries essentially sat there the whole time, which was fine. I was a bit frustrated, because it was towards the end of my shift and I hadn't had a break yet. On top of that, my manager was being extra snippy that day. I asked her if I could finally go on my break. 

""Okay. Do you want us to remake the fries? If you had just ordered the salad you typically get they wouldn't have gotten so cold.""

""Oh, no. It's fine. I'm not super hungry.""

""Okay. It isn't like you need the fries, anyways."" She said this last bit while looking me up and down. 

Now, nobody here really knew that I had/have an eating disorder. So I can't get too upset with her. But fuck, it hurt. Especially for her to judge somebody else's body while she is extremely overweight herself. Anyways, I ended up throwing the fries away.",My manager sort of crossed the line
fatpeoplestories,"Tl;dr currently getting dutch-ovened by fat people smell in a small car in which I’ll be driving for over 8 hours

Hello FPS! Ltl;ftp, on a throwaway, on mobile, yadda yadda. Anyways, I wanted to share this story because I need a sympathetic ear to vent to. Let’s start out with this by saying that I am very active. Played 3 sports in high school and then weight lifted, ran, and conditioned to maintain my good health all throughout college, from which I just graduated (!!!!). Stats wise: F, 21, 59kg, 162cm. My dad is also very fit, since he works in construction and has so for his entire life. However, my mom is basically the complete opposite of both of us, has been for as long as I can remember, about 175 cm and at least 400 pounds.

Now to give you some context, since I played sports, I often came home smelling like a dumpster. I am very fastidious about my personal hygiene (my skincare and haircare routine would make r/skincareaddiction proud), so as you can imagine, I couldn’t wait to hop in the shower and give myself a thorough cleaning with my bougie ass body washes and scrubs from Lush. Despite this, at least a few times a week, my massive mother 15 feet down the hallway would scream some permutation of, “GET IN THE SHOWER”. Even now when my parents visit me, at the end of the day, I still got various comments from her about how my hair doesn’t smell like roses anymore (I have oily hair and yes, it does start to smell a little funky by the time I’m about to hop in the shower, but I’m super self-conscious about it, so it gets taken care of every night with some high quality scalp-lovin shampoo) or some other trivial hygiene related issue that I most definitely knew about and was already taking care of.

Anyways, I just graduated and my parents are helping me relocate, which involves a couple 8 hour drives. After the first day of driving, we get into the hotel. Almost immediately, I hop in the shower, clean up, and get ready for bed. Then, my dad does the same. Then that leaves my mom, who out of all of us, was the one who actually, really needed to shower (I don’t think I have to enlighten any of you about how intense fat people smells are). She doesn’t appear to be making any indication that she is about to shower as  well, so I ask, “Hey mom, are you going to hop in the shower too?” She replies, “Nope, I don’t think so, I’m just going to ride in the car dirty.” I can’t make this shit up, I wanted to cry in that moment. I looked at my dad for some backup, who quickly looked away (he’s a total enabler) and then looked back at my mom, flabbergasted. She saw the horror on my face, and then looked in my eyes with the most callous glare, and said, “You don’t get to have an opinion.” I was shocked, angry, and disgusted. After years of having my personal hygiene thoroughly scrutinized, she had goddamn audacity to simply disregard the most elementary rules of personal hygiene, and looked at me like I’m the bad guy. I’m now locked in this car, it’s been about an hour and friends, I’m honestly just gonna do my level best to let my nose astrally project to another dimension, a dimension filled with roses, Lush bath bombs, and eau de Shalimar. Wish me luck.

On the bus this morning for my morning commute to work. Sitting on the front bench where one parent can sit with two small children, but in rush hour it's usually occupied by two adults commuting to work, this morning it was me and a man who was sitting there,  with a small space between us.
Enter: Hamplanet. No seats available. She can't be expected to stand, not with her cundishuns. Oh no, here she comes. She squeezes her giant ass into the space. She bumps her hips back and forth on the way down, I want to cry. Sunctioned into place, she cranks up her music on her headphones. She pretty young,  probably mid-20s, but she's listening to shitty 80s music.  I love me some 80s but that was even-shitty-in-its-time 80s. Sinead OConnor or some shit. She's breathing  heavy from all the effort. Get this though, her breathing sounds like fucking snoring! I wish I could convey to you the hilarity of everyone on
 the bus around her, hearing her snoring while she sat there wide awake, loudly audible over her shitty blasting music.

fatpeoplestories,"Long time reader first time poster. If this doesn't fit here just delete it. Using throwaway bc I am too chicken shit. Also English is not my first language, yada yada yada.

Maybe be me: 24F, 180cm, 70kg (that's 5'11 and 154lbs in capitalist units) still working on my weight. 

Don't be any of the hams 

I moved to a new country right when I started hitting puberty and by pure luck we moved to a village where people are not too fond of foreigners (an extreme right party was actually in 2nd place there). So when I was in middle and high school (all in the same ridiculously strict catholic school) I was bullied for various reasons: having unmanaged curly hair and having a rather poor language of the country I moved to (let's call it Europastan and the language Eurostanian). I had a terrible accent and couldn't build sentences properly in Eurostanian yet, which a few teachers took as a sign that I wouldn't succeed in life and so they shouldn't even try teaching me and some even took it as far as bullying. I'd rather not talk too much about it as it has fucked me over for life and I still have trouble trusting teachers and professors (important later).

First ham I met was in the high school. She was gross. Let's call her Grease, because she washed her hair once every two months. Now she was maybe not extremely fat. Around 150cm and 82kg according to MBG, but still, she was hammy. She would steal my food very often, proclaiming that as a skinny girl I didn't need it as much as she did. She also would point out to my teachers loudly whenever I forgot to bring my book, which in turn would put me in trouble. She would throw small offhandish insults at me every day, pointing out every possible flaw in my appearance and often proclaiming that she was prettier than I was. 

Second ham was actually my bestie, so let's call her Beastie bc she also refused to do anything about her facial hair. My Body gallery puts her around 168cm and 100kg. Now I have gone through anorexia and she knew that at the time. Still she said that I would have been seen as ugly in older times because only curvy girls were considered beautiful. I don't think curvy means what she thinks it means bc she was more spherical than anything else. She also loved saying how she ate so very little and just couldn't lose weight. (We went to a pizza restaurant for her birthday and I can definitely say she didn't eat little.)

Third and fourth ham are from my university. I'll call one Pony and the other Brady. I'll start with Brady because she did something that made me really mad.

I met Brady before a class of another European language that we will call Southerian. We talked a bit and she said how although she was doing her last year of Masters she just couldn't pass the exam for the first year Southerian grammar and practice and that she thought it was because she was fat and the professors hated her and bullied her. She is around 175cm and 154kg. She told me how when sitting for the oral exam the professors were snickering the whole time. I instantly felt bad for her because I knew that teachers and professors aren't always just. But then the class started and she couldn't make any coherent sentences in Southerian and her grammar was way off. Mind you in that course we already had to have a Eropean level B2 for the language, so I quickly understood why she couldn't pass the grammar exam. That made me really mad at her because it is people like her that are the reason why some people think I exaggerate being bullied by teachers. I never spoke to her again after that. You can't say your professors are bullying you for being fat when you do no work for their classes!

And the last one is Pony,  168cm and around 104kg. I actually am friends with her and I do wish her well, because aside from her occasional hamminess she's actually a fun person to talk to. Now Pony goes to a dietician and has also received a meal plan she should follow because she needs to lose 10kg (approx 20lbs) to get into the healthy weight category. She posted about it on Snapchat and Instagram, saying how excited she was to follow the meal plan. Except... the next day she posted a picture of her Eating a whole carton of ice cream (approx 500ml), the next day she posted a picture of her eating a huge meal at Mickey's Dix. She has been continuosly ballooning and says she doesn't understand why because she follows the meal plan to the T as if she doesn't realise that we saw on snapchat how she actually eats. I am pretty sure that a half a litre of ice cream is not a good substitute for half a glass of milk.... I am also getting worried about her as she is starting to show signs of either PCOS or Type II diabetes. Her eyes and skin are getting darker and she is starting to grow not only a mustache but also a beard. But I feel like I can't say anything because we aren't the best friends, especially not she called me an attention whore after I received a present from a male friend whom i haven't seen in 4 years and after she pulled the same move as Brady and said that our professors were picking on her for her size. She's also a huge fan of HAES and posts about it on her facebook.

Well that is it. I am sorry it is so long and probably very boring. In Europastan there aren't too many hams as there aren't that many overweight people (24% of all women and 28% of all men are overweight) so I decided to just pile them all into one story. If you notice any grammatical mistakes please tell me as I am constantly working on improving my English. And as previously mentioned, mods, if this story doesn't fit here, feel free to delete it.",[Epic] The European hams
fatpeoplestories,"My corpulent frame hasn't waddled around these parts for a bit but I just experience a slug of fat logic this weekend:

I play in an adult softball league and we had a tournament this weekend. As some of you might know, with a large number of working age adults, some with kids, there's bound to be some horizontal achievement among the ranks. The first game of the tournament featured an opponent with a particularly rotund lineup. 

My team is by no means composed of athletes, but the majority take care of themselves. The league is co-ed and as such, our team is 6 girls and 7 guys. All 7 guys can run and hit (especially compared to this team). Throughout this game, on 4 separate occasions, the fat members of their team failed to make a play (get beat to a base, fail to run down a pop-up, etc.) the excuse at hand was ""I don't have as long of legs as you!"" or ""You have long legs and can catch up to it!"" Mind you, our team varies from 5'-6"" to 6'-6"" among the guys and their team was not composed of anyone particularly short. 

I understand if people don't want to be rude and blame people's obesity on their ability to perform, but to blame ""long legs"" as the reason you were beaten handily seems a bit delusional. ","Regarding the phrase ""Your legs are so much longer than mine, I can't move that fast!"""
fatpeoplestories,"Hello FPS, obligatory long time reader, first time poster blah blah blah. Let's just get onto the good stuff shall we?

When I was in high school, through college, I worked at a retirement home community. It wasn't like a convalescent home or anything like that. These, for the most part, were able bodied elderly folk, able to take care of themselves but maybe no longer able to care for an entire home. Some who required more help could hire on site caregivers that were available 24/7 or hire help from an outside source. Included in living here was three square meals a day in the facility dining room, where I worked as a server. Through the time there, it's easy to get to know all the different personalities and the various residents. You know who will be nice and who will be cranky but there was one gentleman that would never cease to surprise me.

Why don't we just call him Elder Ham (EH) for the sake of convenience. This is sort of just a collection of things that I can remember about him through my time there. Now EH was a large man. I never saw him standing so I can't estimate height but he had to be upwards of 450lbs. Frequently, he was a miserable man. Because of this he was often at a table alone when it came to meal time. Occasionally, he would be joined by a new resident that maybe didn't know that his misery was inflicted on anyone who was nice enough to try and keep him company. EH always seemed to know just how to push those people away after he (quickly) got tired of their company. He'd complain about the woman's perfume or medicated ointment he could swear he could smell. Or he'd called her ugly (and let me tell you, with all his missing teeth, he was no looker). Inevitably, he'd be left alone to partake in his meals.

But lets get into the good stuff. Anytime anyone served EH, we'd have to come back to the kitchen with his order and inform the chef that we needed an ""Elder Ham sized portion"" of whatever he decided he wanted. Usually, the residents had options of two entrees and frequently he'd order one of each. The chefs tend to serve up appropriate sized food but EH dubbed this as ""not enough"" and that we were ""starving him"" and if he didn't receive a HEAPING portion of food with a BIG side of gravy, he would never be happy. All his salads needed two or three sides of ranch dressing that the kitchen never skimped on the mayo when they mixed it up, PLUS a jello, PLUS cottage cheese, two big helpings of the main course and two desserts. Don't even get me started on his coffee that he had with every meal. He'd bring his own powdered flavored creamer, pour half of it on the table instead of his mug, mix in about 8 or 9 splendas and enjoy several cups like this. I was always equally disgusted and impressed he was able to eat as much as he was with his three teeth...

Now EH never stood. Ever. He was equipped with the biggest motorized wheelchair I'd ever seen and boy could that thing go fast. It must have had some sort of turbo button because he'd tear through the facility, burning rubber and crashing into walls and cabinets and nearly other residents who were crawling along with their walkers. In fact, several women had written stern letters to the management to ask that he slow down as he'd nearly ran over so many of them! But he absolutely HAD to be first to the fresh baked cookies or happy hour events... It always seemed like the facility handyman was following EH around with spackle to repair the damaged and chipped walls and corners. Did I mention he broke the cabinet door clean off the hinges one day while pillaging the napkin supply we had stashed under the coffee bar?  (He would basically make a 10 napkin bib because he was too big to properly be able to sit at the table. He'd have to rest the plate on his stomach and eat from there and still manage to spill food all over.)

Every apartment door in the facility was equipped with a shiny metal plate about ankle/shin height, to protect the door from getting too banged up from the walkers most of the residents pushed around. But EH? He'd crashed into his door so hard, so many times, he'd scraped straight through the metal and into the wood. His scooter so large that he'd dug gouges out of the wooden door jam. I'm pretty sure that room will never been the same. 

From what I understood, when he wasn't eating in the dining room or falling asleep in the common areas or being a general roaming safety hazard, he was in bed, unable to do much for himself without the help of his caregiver...

Basically, he was only nice when he felt it would get him more food, was generally unpleasant, and would run over poor elderly grandmas just trying to have a nice afternoon snack. Oh, and he'd drink a two liter of coke every day between lunch and dinner meals...you know, to keep his sugars up. I'm not sure whatever happened to him, however. In my last year of working there, he stopped coming to meal times (instead having the food taken to his room). Apparently, he'd broken his scooty puff (twice...his family wouldn't pay to fix it again) and then became too big to fit into his regular wheel chair to come down to meals anymore. Last I heard he was still eating the place dry but still up in his room!",Elderly Scooter Ham
fatpeoplestories,"Obligatory ltl;ftp, but goddamn did this woman's cundishuns fuck up my day/night.

Probably dont want to be, but me:31 M, 5'11, 165-170ish? Been travelling across northern Europe for a month, almost forgotten about the existence of hams.

For the love of the holy Roman empire, dont be: Wheezenhamm: German, Mid-30s, not quite scooterham level, but rapidly heading there if she lives long enough. 5 flat, maybe 250ish? I'm bad with weight.

To set the scene, I was in Stockholm when I decided to go up past the polar circle the next day. Planning ain't my thing on this trip. Took the night train going to the middle of lapland. 

All the sleeper cars are sold out, so I figure what the hell. Slept in worse places than the generously-sized seats on the train. Besides, cant be that many people actually going all the way north, I'm bound to end up with a row to myself sooner rather than later. Train's packed leaving the city, I get assigned an aisle seat next to someone of normal size, life is good. We pass a couple stops and score, my neighbor is off. Get to stare out the window at the never-setting sun till I fall asleep. Life. Is. GOOD. Well, for a while, anyways. 

A couple hours into the 17 hour train ride, there's a long stop so me and a few others pile out of the train to stretch/have a smoke/whatever. Not many people getting on so I figure my seat is fine. I get back on and notice that my (actual) seat is now occupied by several pieces of luggage, a giant bag from the station sandwich shop, and about 6lbs of grapes, and my hard-stolen seat is taken up by, well. Let's put it this way. Her ass was so big that when she sat, her elbows didnt reach down to the armrests. She's damn near a foot shorter than me, but when we both sit down she's a foot taller. A true, meaty, ham.


Of note, these trains have a ton of luggage space. There's overhead racks that completely swallow the backpack I've lived out of for a month, theres a baggage compartment at each end for stuff you cant/wont lift into the rack, and theres space under the seat. Absolutely no reason for your shit to take up the seat I paid for, and 99% of people make sure it doesnt. She looks unhappy about my presence, but what can you do. Instead of walking the literal 3 feet to the baggage compartment, she stuffed all her things where her feet should be, so now a ham hock is in the armrest space. Terrific. I dont care, just dont touch me and let me sleep. 

Given the subreddit, You can guess what happened next. The crinkling of wrappers (theres a dining car right behind us. With tables and utensils.), and the smell of.... I want to say tuna with bacon and sausage? It was that odd mix of several delicious smells that swirl together into a wretched mess. I think it was originally a sandwich, but since she stuffed it under herself, it is now a big ol' mess of leaking shit. (Again, dining car. Utensils. Be a fucking human.) And its leaking off the little in-seat table in my direction. She's paying no attention, and the smell is close to making me retch, so I decide that really, the dining car is a nice place with coffee, a bar stool facing a big, unobstructed by hams, window, and a rather delightful smell of cold shrimp and bleach. I'm not going to start shit in a language I dont speak, just let her feast and maybe she'll be asleep by the time I'm back.

She was. And here, ladies and gents, we come to the main course of our program. I come back and realize that I forgot to take my charger with me, so it's now sitting in a rather large puddle of fishbaconsausage juice, which is still dripping off the now-closed tray table. Whatever, its asleep, I dont care. 

It's asleep.

Half the traincar jolts awake at this mix of a walrus having an orgasm and an elephant's balls being crushed. Wheezenhamm opens her eyes, reaches up and does this weird one-hand pullup? On the little bar on the window. Metal creaks. Those things aren't there to hold up that much weight, lady. Your ass is gonna break the window. Her... workout, I guess? Done, she reaches for the grapes. Plastic crinkles, chewing is heard, and silence reigns supreme as she goes back to sleep.

Oh dear God please dont tell me

LOUD MOAN. 10 minutes on the dot.

The creak of rapidly fatiguing metal, the plastic and grape chewing repeat, and she's out like a light again. Wheeze. 10 minutes on the dot, every time. This goes on for 5 hours. 5 fucking hours, every 10 minutes the train car is treated to the dying sounds of a molested walrus. Dining car closes rather early into this, so my only alternative to being moaned at is to hang out between train cars, which is neither pleasant nor helping the nausea building up from my hangover, the fishbaconsausage smell, and the constant moaning. I'm also, quite frankly, angry as shit because this piece of lard is preventing me from getting any rest and in another 4 hours or so I'm going to be hiking up a mountain. I'm already way under-dressed for that climate, and now I'll be doing it after not sleeping for 30+ hours. 

Finally, with one last moan, she wakes up. There's really no funny payoff here. She spends the next couple of hours slurping up grapes and trying to take pictures of me (what the fuck, lady? At least be sneaky about that and use the front camera, not the selfie one cause I CAN CLEARLY SEE YOU TAKING THE PICTURE. Didnt ask permission, didnt say word fucking one, just stuck her damn phone in my face and took pictures. I grabbed it and deleted them because again, what the absolute everliving fuck, lady? She apologized, I grunted.) 

Well, I lied. There is a small payoff. When she finally got off the train 2 stops before me, I fell into the most blissful hourlong nap of my life, then went out and took a long, scenic hike in a mindblowingly beautiful part of the world. So fuck you, wheezenhamm. I still got to enjoy my day.","Wheezenhamm, or a farewell to sanity."

Last night we went to see Hotel Artemis (not a bad movie and Jeff Gold~~daddy~~blum is very, uh, uh, *good* as the Wolf King). She bought a huge Icee and a huge popcorn. In general I really dislike going to evening movies because the smell of theaters in generally makes me want to throw up but in order to spend time with my young cousin who recently came out as queer, gotta support. Babyqueer is on walking a precarious line between hamdom and fitness. But I'll talk about that later. Back to Saraham.

So we get movie-beetus and go to out seats. This is a nice theater with reclining chairs, you know the ones. Super duper wide and like 52 occupancy for a single screen. She takes up Two chairs. It's assigned seating so when the people sitting next to us arrived, she had to squish all her fat into her own chair. For reference, I took up maybe half a chair.

The general slurping and popcorn munching was standard fair, nothing new to report on there but jesus christ, the breathing. Now my entire mom's side has terrible lungs. It just be that way. But I could hear every little thing she did in regards to her lungs. It sounded like Darth Vader, if Darth Vader had been Arizona fat. It continually ruined my immersion. 0/10 will not go to a movie with her again.


ENTREE
This happened today so I see fit to really get started with it.
She wanted to hang out. Fair enough, we don't see each other that often and I leave tomorrow with Nana to visit some of our other family. Side note, I plan to stalk Keanu Reeves in NYC after ditching said relatives. But and I quote the conversation since it happened over text, we talked about getting lunch yesterday:
&gt;well I think we missed lunch, but would you like to hang out this afternoon?

&gt;Yeah sure. Did you have something in mind or

&gt;**Not really. All I ever do is eat**

Now I've got some disordered eating habits and I was feeling up to bingeing and she's so fat we can't just walk around a mall or something. Also its 108 (42.2C) degrees out so no hanging out outside. Whatever. I only ate a pancake and some strawberries today. I respond
&gt;.-. wanna like go to a bakery and eat some cupcakes?

&gt;most definitely!!

The moral of this is that we have so little in common that we went out for cake and that's pretty sad because I do value my family but here we are. 7/10 will eat out with her again because it made me feel better about how much I ate.



PLAT PRINCIPAL
This one takes place last year. I'm into kpop (yes I know) and my parents weren't going to take me to a kpop concert no way Jose. But Saraham offered and who was I to say no to going to GDragon? (It was lit af and I almost passed out that's how much fun I had). I'm a dumb gay who can't drive so I didn't have a lot of options. 

The drive up there from where the family had rented a house took about two and a half- three hours. LA Traffic is a bitch. The entire time she asked about food and I, being a dumb anxiety ridden queer, just kept my mouth shut saying I had eaten a lot that morning(false, I had some cashews and strawberries and chocolate milk) and that I wasn't hungry. But she wouldn't. Shut. Up. About food and I was uncomfortable as all hell. I focused on not hyperventilating about the concert and deflected her questions. 

So we get to the street the show is on and she gets right back on about food and we talk about a few options but again, I'm not really hungry and I'm keyed the fuck up about GD (GD!!!) and I'm like 'if you want something we can stop.' But she seems to think that this night is mostly about me and we just keep on driving to the venue. She makes a comment about it not being the greatest area, and really, how much of south LA county can be considered a great area? It wasn't that bad and it was only a little worse than the area I live in now it so I'm like it's whatever. We're white for reference. She makes this I guess ultimatum? about not stopping after the show for food and I'm like 'whatever' you know? I'm not sketched out about it like her. Over it.

So we finally arrive at the venue and start looking for parking. There's a lot surrounding the venue and to self park it was like $10, not that bad. I'm a cheap bitch and usually the squad street parks for shows but sketchy area remember, *rolls eyes*.
So, instead of just walking the few hundred feet, Saraham pays $40 to park in the special lot. Not even valet but like the lot closest to the doors. Not even the doors for regular ticket holders, the lot and doors for VIPs. We still had to walk around the building and I'm like whatever, it's your money.

We stand in line to get in and once we do, we walk around because we can't go to our seats yet and I'm pointing out what shirts people are wearing and talking about the history of BIGBANG and GD and living my best life. Making friends with other people of the fandom. I don't speak Korean (re:im white) so sometimes it was hard but I made it work. But maybe 30 minutes later, Saraham is back on her bullshit about eating. She keeps bugging me to eat and I'm like no. But I get in line with her and she orders like $50 worth of food, but it's stadium food so it's really not that much. I get a water bottle because hydration and I was gearing up for a lot of screaming. She stands in line for a while and gets her fried junk and big cup of beetus and we find somewhere for her to eat it. I have to look away I'm generally so disgusted with he way she eats. Food just disappears into the maw of Jabba and I felt like throwing up. I stare at this absolutely beautiful girl who I wish I had the balls to talk to and calm down. The worst has passed. 

The show goes on. I almost faint because that's how much I love GD. After the show I can barely speak and so we leave and I'm ready to buy my $10 bootleg tshirt outside the venue but before I could even voice that desire, Saraham is talking about getting food on the trek back to the house. *Sigh*

-3/10 will avoid at all costs going to a show with her again.


FROMAGE
Let's talk about the way she parents my newly queer cousin, Babyqueer. She tries to be cool and hip with her even though Babyqueer has continually said my mom's cooler (damn straight I love my mommy and think she's cool af too). I don't think this is particularly fatlogic-y but it's definteily up there with catfishing, which is a very fat person thing to do

Saraham has created a finsta (fake insta) to spy on Babyqueer. She admitted this to me. She told me how she did it and is using to to spy on Babyqueer and her friends. Holy fuck. In no universe is that ok. I kept my damn mouth shut and plan to warn Babyqueer of it and give her the resources so that Saraham doesn't get sus about it. 

I'm still a little in shock, since this came out about an hour before I started to write this post up and really is one of the motivators for me to finally joining the dialogue on here. 

I honestly don't even know what to think. Telling me about it, the 18 year old who's parents raised him right and knows what invasion of privacy and deception look like, was an obvious attention grab. Saraham wants to be cool with me but holy fuck that was not the way to do it.

Babyqueer is currently at her girlfriends house and since Saraham probably also reads her texts, I'll have to tell her about it in person. 

The whole thing is leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth. If you have any advice, I'd be glad to hear it. -1/10 will not give her my insta or any other medias.


DESSERT
Saraham is a hoarder. No way around it. So much so that Nana has converted one of the spare rooms in her house to a room for Babyqueer. 

I've been to her apartment once and that was enough for me to never go back there again. There was a layer of food wrappers and waste on the floor. The smell was appalling but contained to the apartment. It smelt like a dumpster. I fancy myself a minimalist and looking at how much sheer junk was there made my stomach turn. There is no way it's safe to live in that, let alone raise a child. In addition to the food waste and mess of the kitchen, general unwashed plates in the sink, old food sitting on the counter, overflowing trash; the rest of the house was full of plastic junk. Like cheap mcbeetus toys and plastic junk a la toys r us. I'm so glad I was only there for a minute because I was ready to vomit. Not like that would have ever been cleaned up anyway. -10/10 will never be friends with a hoarder or go back to her apartment ever.


CAFE
So there you have it, frens. My recollections of my Aunt the Ham. I'm sure there's more that can be found out from my mom and Nana and my cousins but these are my personal experiences. Feel free to ask questions because I'm still in shock about all the hamminess I experienced in the past two days. I think I'm going to go for a long swim in the pool to try and feel clean. I hope I tagged this correctly as an Epic because it was a wild ride typing this up but I feel a lot better and hopefully some of you will find it in your hearts to commiserate with me. 
","My Aunt, the Ham [epic]"
fatpeoplestories,"A common theme in fatlogic and HAES-circles is that we shouldn't brag about weight loss or talk about exercising because there are people who ""can't"" do it, and they may feel offended, hurt, or otherwise triggered by being reminded of these things that they can't do.

Now, imagine that other more-or-less disadvantaged groups applied the same logic:

All of a sudden, you can't post pictures on social media, because there are blind people out there and they can't see them and if they can't experience them neither should anyone else.

For the same reason, any ""visualist"" language like ""I saw"" or simply proclaiming that you understand by saying ""I see"" is now on par with the n-word.

Fat activists as we all know don't like it when you talk about running, but now, you can't even talk about how you walked to the store. There are millions of people out there who can't walk, you insensitive bastard! What if they hear you or read your facebook status and get hurt by being reminded of their disability?

You may think it's good encouragement to tell someone to ""stand up for themselves"", but that's just because you're a walkist shitlord. And why do we assume that it's better to ""stand up"" for yourself than to ""sit down"" for yourself? That's just the kind of language that perpetuates the oppression of the wheel-bound!

These are just a few examples I thought of off the top my head, feel free to add your own.",If other disadvantaged groups had their own fatlogic...
fatpeoplestories,"Okay, so, this happened this past Saturday.  Every 3 weeks I have a circulation shift on Saturday.  Our food/drink policy is drinks are okay if they have a lid/cap.  We even sell bottles of soda/pop at circulation.  I am also in charge of a small set of 6 shelves used for displays across from circulation.  Basically stuff for people to scan as they pass, and have a summer reading one for that time.  I recently had a Coca-Cola related display as a ""placeholder"" in there for the short time before SRP kicked off.  This display featured items from my deceased father's personal collection, items that he was able to only get because he worked for the company.  Yeah, you can see where this is going.

So this past Saturday, a big guy with a nasty ass beard lumbered up to the desk.

""Hi, can I help-""

""GIMME A COKE"" he belched, tossing two nasty looking dollar bills on the counter.

""Okay, one second!""

I go to grab the bottle only to find we're out.  Great.

""Well, it looks like we're out right now, and don't have any cold.  We've got Diet Coke, Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Sprite and Water, though!  Would any of those work?""

He grunts.

""Er...I mean there's a market across the street, I don't think they've closed yet?""

""JIST GIMME A WARM ONE THEN.""

""I'm sorry, I don't know if we even have any, and I can't leave the desk.""

""YEAH YOU DO, RIGHT THERE.""  he points to the display cases, where commemorative bottles are on display.  (They may have been drinkable once, but the newest is 20 years old, not to mention these have been in storage in a garage for over 5.)

""Ah, I'm sorry, but those aren't for sale, only display.  They're part of my father's collection, and pretty old or undrinkable as it is.""

He looks me right in the eye as he says
""He won't miss it.  He probably don't even care about it if he's lettin' the library use it.""

Guys.  I lost my dad to a horrific cancer.  I watched him wither away and die.  He loved us so much, and I know he would have been ***ECSTATIC*** about a coke display, as he loved working for them.  Now, granted, this guy didn't know that.  So I kept it cool, though was still passively offended in my tone.

""No.  That collection is part of my father's estate, and a family heirloom now.  Please don't ask about buying them again.""

He grumbled, but seemed to accept my answer.  He disappeared into the fiction section.  My coworkers said they'd keep an eye out just in case and I went to lunch.

30 minutes later, I came back, and the desk was busy.  I put my lunch box away and stepped out to take a position, and who do I spy trying to pry the glass case open?

I dropped all demeanor.

""HEY, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!""  I shouted, rushing over to stop him.

""I'M THIRSTY!"" he shouted back, trying to swipe at me.

""Then get some water, or another pop!  I told you before these belong to my father!""

And I wish I could make up what happened next.

""Psh, he don't need 'em, he's dead!  Clingin' onto his crap ain't gonna bring him back.""

Had my coworkers not come over, I'm sure I would have killed this guy.  I was shaking with rage, and the tears started flowing.

""How....dare...."" I started as my female coworker put her arm around me to keep me from lunging.  I was at least going to give this fuck some words, but our male coworker stepped in.

""Out.""

""Wut?""

""Out.  You're banned from the library.  Don't come back.""

""The fuck?  You can't do that!  I didn't do anything!""

""You're trying to steal not only the library but from the estate of one of our employee's father.  You're done.  Get out before we call the police and have them remove you.""

He finally looked at me, and I must have been wearing an expression of murder yet, because his face just *dropped*.

""..W-Whatever.  The internet sucks here anyway.""

That was it.  He just lumbered off with my male coworker following him to make sure he left.  I went to the bathroom to pull myself together, and my female coworker finished checking out the que of people.

We suspended his account, sent an email to the ML about the ban and finished out the work day.  The display was fine, and did pretty well, plenty of patrons liked it.  I may even feature it again in a few years.  But for now, it's going home. ","Library Tales 3 (One story, much rage edition)"
fatpeoplestories,"Location: California

Offender: Munch(ausen's) Ham

Me: first-year medical student raised by two doctors that have been doctors for 30+ years. I know some shit, specifically a lot of shit about the human body and not much else about anything. book-smart, real-life-retarded. how do you change a tire?

I used to work at a pizza delivery place in Southern California in a very wealthy suburb in a wealthy part of San Diego that (generally) tipped well with a colorful cast of coworkers, and was always good for a shitty customer story perpetrated by a Soccer Mom driving a Mercedes SUV bigger than my house to tote her Brayden/Jayden/Aiden and Kinsleigh to soccer practice just to ignore them to online shop with her workaholic husband's credit card that he gave her just to avoid spending time with her. these women were everywhere, by the way. venturing into one particular suburb was surreal. me, a heavily tattooed/pierced, generally-scary-looking human being trolling the aisles of Target was usually given a wide berth due to my appearance and resting bitch face. always a fun social experiment to see how many side-eyes I could get on a single outing. today, an old lady scoffed at me in line at the grocery store when I thanked her for putting the divider down between her stuff and mine. it's fun.

anyway, one of my coworkers was the 300lb, 5'5 MunchHam. A hypochondriac that bragged about calling the paramedics to her house at least once a week (called them to work twice) being on a ""no-narcotics list"" at the hospital, being ""mistreated"" by her ""asshole surgeon"", and a whole host of other things that are not badges of honor and left me wondering why someone would brag about this kind of shit. still doesn't make sense regarding most of the human population with dignity and a sense of humility, but considering her personality, it makes a little bit of sense.

in 2016, MunchHam broke her ankle. to be specific, a relatively common fracture of the ankle variety: a lateral malleolus fracture, which is part of the anterior/posterior distal tibia. this kind of fracture, and ankle breaks in general, usually necessitate surgery with internal fixation; titanium screws. titanium is one of the hardest metals available for consumers and used for medical implants. all my piercings are made out of titanium. titanium is not ferromagnetic and does not set off metal detectors, nor does it respond to the massive magnets in an MRI. the integrity of titanium is relevant, I promise.

how did she break this ankle? she CLAIMS that she broke this ankle falling off the toilet. at work. she called an ambulance for that too, but that was probably the one legitimate occurrence cause nobody wants to lift a 300lb, pantsless hamplanet off the floor of a dirty bathroom. however, her version of the truth has always been somewhat exaggerated so I don't know how true that is. she claims she landed on her ankle and broke it. that's some Ham Acrobatics right there. I'm convinced she's got osteoporosis cause that doesn't happen to a healthy person with healthy bones. (make your kids drink milk or give them calcium pills. bones are important y'all). 

after her surgery, she didn't go to PT. she complained of chronic pain that is the result of not going to PT, went back to high-intensity workouts too soon and SHATTERED the titanium screws and needed MORE surgery. she broke ALL FOUR TITANIUM SCREWS. SHE FUCKING BROKE THEM IN HALF. TITANIUM. she proudly showed the x-ray on her phone around to anyone who would look. I looked, out of sheer curiosity and morbid fascination. and of course, evidence. *insert tapping temple meme*

by the way, I don't know why she works out. she's not losing weight. she was the same exact size the whole 2 years I knew her. she would regularly uberEATS Wendy's/equally trashy food from a place less than a 15-minute round trip from work (mind you our breaks were 30 minutes and delivery takes 30+ so she'd regularly clock back in and eat on the clock and ignore responsibilities, not to mention the money she's spending, inflated item prices + $5 delivery), or go next door to 7-11 and get two hot dogs or some other mystery meat of the day and a large amount of candy and ALWAYS, ALWAYS with the big gulp of non-diet Mountain Dew. don't forget the ""inspirational"", slightly-SJW Instagram that promotes healthy lifestyle and weight loss and 'gymming'. the facebook was a whole other shitshow. I haven't accepted her friend request. it's been rotting in my inbox for over a year. I don't need to. my roommate and former coworker has her on fb and it's like watching a semi-literate monkey with no filter in a zoo scrawl crazed thoughts on a whiteboard. free entertainment.

anyway, of course four broken, raw-edge titanium screws would cause anyone pain so she goes back into surgery to have them fixed. also, she's considered low-income so she gets cheap health insurance (CoveredCA here) that covers ALL of this nonsense. I've never been one to use the phrase ""as a taxpayer"" because usually when I hear somebody say that, it's coming out of the mouth of a 50-something baby boomer that thinks millennials are spoiled, entitled brats, that Trump is the second coming of Jesus, immigrants are ruining this country, the whole nine yards. but AS A TAXPAYER, I hate this woman. not cause she's fat. because she's a horrible person. important distinction.

she's also a low-level semi-functional narcotics addict. of course they give you a narcotic script post-op, but she's literally an addict. she openly pops pills in front of everyone and does the 'look at me' sigh like it's such a hassle. she pulled this shit with me, in front of me. I was standing at the label printer at work around 8pm, doing labels, minding my own goddamn business, when I hear this long-suffering sigh off to my left. I side-eye as best I can and she sees it cause she was watching me like a hawk for any kind of reaction, gets what she wants, and says ""I wish I didn't have to take SO MANY PILLS to help me sleep. god, why can't my body work properly?"" and pops like three pills (no doubt a narcotic, maybe a benzo, and maybe an anti-inflammatory or a steroid) and washes them down with non-diet mountain dew. every god damn day she'd drink an entire giant gulp or whatever the medium-to-large size was full of non-diet mountain dew. I did not give her an inch. I went back to what I was doing and once she realized she wasn't getting anything from me, she just left.

I'd also like to add at this point that I myself have a whole slew of health issues that have necessitated extensive hospitalizations and the total amount of drugs I've had to take and am currently still taking are worth more than my mom's house. I hear my lungs are pretty good looking though. my cardiac surgeon says so. AND I'm ever thankful for my mom's health insurance otherwise I would most certainly be dead. But I don't broadcast it nor do I base my entire identity around being ill. She thinks we're Pals™ because she overheard me talking about my body's proclivity for attempting to throw in the towel randomly and without warning and I had to give her a stiff talking to as to not open her fat mouth about it. I appear able-bodied at this point but there will be a day that I don't. miss me with that sympathetic shit though, you miserable bitch. I will die jumping out of a plane before I die in a hospital bed. Fuck you. 

I digress. I'm sorry. Continued:

I'm almost positive it's illegal to be at work under the influence of anything. It is, right? do prescription pills count? Remember, this was a pizza place. She was a driver. She 100% drove while on Percocet multiple times. She also came into work one day bragging about buying morphine pills off 'a friend' for ~$10/pill. She doesn't have any bills. She lives with her disabled, retired parents (good source of drugs too, I'm sure). She's 35. Her mom drove her to work 45+ minutes away against traffic every day during the tail end of my employment. She can't drive (doctor's orders) because her ankle is busted. of course that's the one instruction she follows cause she loves being a victim. Her parents bought her a car. She also parks in the disabled spot at work (she has a placard, for what I wonder? /s) and doesn't move the car for her entire shift. She works inside cause she can't drive (but broke the doctor's orders to drive to work). So she doesn't leave for 5-8 hours at a time. This happened after the first surgery when she was still driving and delivering intermittently (and popping Percocet &amp; Vicodin; ""my favorite"" like they were candy). her selective following of rules and mental gymnastics to justify those things was mind-boggling. of course, that was why she ordered delivery food every day. can't drive. doctor's orders. 

By the way, the parking lot is minuscule. There are like three disabled spots. relatively busy shopping center in a retirement community town. there are DEFINITELY people who need that spot more than her. btw, the farthest spot is less than 500 feet away. She doesn't even have to work! In America, being fat (how fat? I don't know) is a disability. You can GET disability for it. her ankle also qualifies. Nobody knew why she was there. Again, she has a disabled placard so the DMV and her doctor classify her as disabled. getting government assistance wouldn't be a stretch.

My FAVORITE part: she blames her orthopedic surgeon for 'fucking her up for life', as if orthopedic surgeons are crackpots that aren't in one of the most competitive fields in medicine and didn't go through one of the most intensive and rigorous internships and residencies there is. no, nothing is her fault ever and it's her surgeon's fault she can't work out anymore and 'lose more weight' so she's gonna get Medicare/MediCal/whatever the fuck it's called to cover her gastric bypass. still waiting on that gastric bypass, by the way. do you know why? the show My 600lb Life is accurate in their portrayal of the weight-loss surgery process. every single gastric surgery candidate is REQUIRED to follow a nutritionist's diet before surgery to be approved. she does not, but assumes nobody knows that so she makes up all kinds of reasons why she hasn't gotten the surgery yet, all of them blaming medical personnel and how they're all out to get her. I never said anything cause I loved the excuses and stories. I'd poke the ham/bear from time to time, and I'm pretty good at being two-faced when I know the real story and I just like hearing lie fodder. ""so, MunchHam, how's 'gymming'? has your doctor approved you for the gastric sleeve yet?""

I think that's it. I tried not to exercise ""my creative writing skills"", so dear mods: I apologize if you think this is flowery. I tried not to be boring, or hateful of fat people, I dislike this woman because she discredits medical science, of which I am forever thankful to and passionate about, and blames her issues on everyone else. this is like a hybrid Munchausen's/Hamplanet story, hence the story of MunchHam.

Edits: grammar, a word here and there, bared less of my personal shit on the internet and summarized it better. I posted this under my main so I wonder what I'll wake up to. ",the MunchHam (originally a comment on another thread)
fatpeoplestories,"I've posted bout him before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/87mc5g/minimoon_brother_eats_his_food_then_my_food_twice/) if you want to read his other story.

My moon sized brother eats full meals when he gets home as snacks but this takes the cake as the most he's eaten and the shittiest thing he's done yet.

Earlier this morning I went to the store and bought a lot of food to cook. It was celery, 3 types of onions, carrots, peas, edamame, bok choy, some chicken, some pork, rice, noodles, a few types of egg-rolls, spring-rolls, and various ingredients for several kinds of sauces. I bought a lot of this stuff, damn near 50$ which I worked my ass off for. This was all of my money I have until I find a job to hire me. This is all for one of my friends who has severe depression and usually doesn't eat. I cooked all of this into several types of stir-fry and fried rice. I made five flavors, to last her for the next two or so weeks. These were large portions and you could make an egg-roll or spring-roll to go with it. It's a lot of fucking food.

This moon, this pile of fat and narcissism, ATE IT ALL. He threw the containers for the food as well as the wrappers, and the boxes for the egg-rolls behind the couch. I don't now how he ate this much food.

He KNEW who it was for. He KNOWS how much she means to me. He did this AFTER he stole 20$ to buy FUCKING FUNKO POPS. The 20$ was the only money I had at the time and I had saved to take the same person I made this food for out to dinner the day she came back from college.

fatpeoplestories,"I worked in a store that had several scooter carts for the disabled. A man and his wife come in and she has an oxygen tank and needs a scooter. All of them are gone. 

I get him a manual wheelchair cart. This one is never used and help him get his wife situated. He sighs that he's not sure if he can push her around the store and I volunteer to help them shop. 

I push this wheelchair cart with this old couple and they are sweet and I help them get things from the top shelf, but every time I see one of the scooters on the floor it has a fat person just too lazy to walk. 

Over and over, scooter = fat person. Maybe some of them did have medical conditions, but I can't believe all of them did. All of them are hogging a scooter that this woman needed. They are for the disabled. 

I'm glad that I was able to help that couple out, but I shouldn't have had to. 

When I got back to the front half the scooters were dead due to the fatties not plugging them back up when they were finished. ",Fat people hogging the scooters
fatpeoplestories,"I work in a grocery store, and although I work third shift, the store is open at the last 1-2 hours of my shift. I love third shift because it's nice and quiet, I do my work amidst the crappy Muzak that plays 24/7 in the store. (literally) but sometimes I have to deal with a customer or two as the store opens.

This story happens almost a year ago, and I have done my best to restore the details as faithfully as possible.

I work in the bakery, and our donut case is self-serve. It's a pretty obvious setup, with clear plastic doors, and cubbyholes where you can fond plastic bags and wax paper for getting donuts, as well as boxes if you want a larger number.

The bakery clerk has not come in yet, so I am so far the only one in the bakeshop. I'm almost done with my work, baking off cookies, getting things ready for my clean-up, etc.

I see a hand wave over the display case along with some mooing sounds that I am almost certain were meant to be a 'Yoohoo!"", and come to the front to see a rather large woman - i'd have to say 300-350 pounds, in one of the store scooters, parked in front of the display case with a scowl on her face.

She then proceeds to speak to me in that mushed-up way many hamplanets do, almost as if they have food already in their mouth. ""I WANT A BOX OF DONUTS""

Once in a while, supplies might run out and a customer will point it out to me, no worries, I'll grab more boxes, waxed paper, whatever. So I do a quick glance, and the case is stocked with everything a customer could need to get their own donuts (or muffins, bagels, and rolls) So I calmly point it out to her and point how the case is self-serve, gesturing to the easily-opened lightweight plastic doors (Seriously, our senior citizens with canes and mobility scooters have no problems getting themselves donuts)

""NO NO U MAKE ME ONE"" She points to the box we use that fits about 12-18 donuts. I've been reading FPS for several years now, and it's not too hard for me to see where this is going. Hell, her physical description would fit right here.

This was late summer or early autumn, so she was dressed relatively light in a tank top that looked like it'd tried its best to hold in her rolls of fat, and ultimately just gave up. Thank God she was wearing a bra. She had on something like Capri's or yoga pants, it was hard to tell because of how stretched it was. Peeking between the tank and the pants, and only partially held in by the latter, was an impressive-looking fupa. Her stringy, greasy hair was tied back in a really tight ponytail, and she has a couple of tattoos along her shoulders and arms, of what I am certain were song lyrics or some shitty poetry.

Flip-flops (barely) contain feet that look like their arch has been completely flattened, and didn't look well-maintained either, I'm certain one toe was infected. (beetus foot maybe? Even if it was nothing more than an ingrown toenail it looked terrifying)

The basket in front of her cart already had a couple of packages of pastries from the bakery. I try to extricate myself out of this situation by telling her that I have a lot of work to do, and repeating in my sweetest, most polite tone that the case was self-serve, for the CONVENIENCE of all of our customers!

""MUH FEET HURT AND I DON WANNA STAND""

Sigh. God fucking damn it. God fucking damn condishuns. The top area of the case would require ANYONE to stand, so with a tight, resentful smile I unfold a box and get it ready to retrieve donuts for her. She points out one by one, and the fucker actually wants me to use a separate piece of paper for EACH AND EVERY FUCKING DONUT and then present it to her for approval. A couple of times, she demanded that I put a donut back after it failed to pass her inspection.

And yes, she smelled. A few of the donuts she wanted were literally within her arm's reach and I had to lean down and reach past her, and she smelled of sweat and Chee-tos. At the very least, it was one of these weird, chemical snack-cheese odors. And there were other smells that I don't want to attempt to identify.

After this ordeal was done, I did not get a single thank-you. I've been thanked by customers for answering one simple question, and I've been thanked for assisting people who were having a hard time with getting something due to disability or whatever. It's all part of customer service, as well as common courtesy.

Yet this woman DEMANDED that I serve her when the case was obviously meant to be self-serve, and did not thank me for wasting my time or having to tolerate her smell.

Not only that, but she inconvenienced a couple of other customers. She was parked almost parallel to the case, taking up nearly half the space. When she was ordering me around, I was moving around in the other half. When I saw that I had another customer waiting, I motioned him forward. He shook his head politely and waited, eyeing me and the ham with an expression of 'do what you got to do'

Couple of minutes later, another customer strolls by, a young woman who looks like she might be in college. Unlike the old man, she doesn't want to wait, and I step aside and let her get her stuff. She grabs several muffins and places them in a bag, all the while the hamplanet is making moaning, puffing sounds of impatience. Given how many FPS I've read, I half expected Ham to make some 'skinny bitch' comment. The lady in question was average. Not skinny but what looked like a healthy BMI.

I can see the woman's lips tighten as I stand there, but neither of us speak, and she leaves with her muffins without any drama or comment. I go back to getting the ham her fucking donuts and end up putting together TWO big boxes (about 28-30 donuts)

I tell her in my best service smile and tone, ""there you go!"" as I hand them to her, ""Have a nice day!""

She just glares at me and drives off, almost running over my foot. The guy who had been waiting shakes his head, and I shrug and shake my head. I go back to work, he gets his donuts, and that's it.

Sorry there was no justice boner, but anyone who works in any sort of retail know that this kind of shit happens on a regular basis, regardless of customer's weight.",Hamplanet too fucking lazy to get her own god damn donuts

Yaddyadaya long time lurker first time poster LET'S DO THIS! Formatting maybe different due to mobile.


Be me DietSag - 15 5'7 108lbs Male (I thought I was heavier but just found out my scale was wrong) 


Don't be AJJ (Almond Joy Jigglypoof) - the female, cuuuurvy almond joy dieter I met at the convenience store. Not good at guessing weight, but looks maybe 250-300lbs. Looks around 30.


Prologue: I go down to a convience store nearly every day to grab diet dranks, snacks, or something for dinner. Due to my lightweight I can very easily get to the bottom or top shelf of any aisle rather easily, and sometimes get looks. I mainly get the same things every time, but this day i wanted something for my sweet tooth. I sometimes see AJJ shop the same time as me. Now, onwards to the story.


Yesterday I went to sacrifice candy to my inner beetus with cravings of chocolate. To my surprise, AJJ was grabbing some condishun curing treats for her?self as well.


We are both in the aisle and I see Reeses pb cups on the bottom shelf. I bend over :&gt; in an almost impossible position somebody of her stance could get into (imagine a frog on 2 toes) and as I grab my cholesterol cups I hear:


""I would eat that too but I am on a diet""


I look up and see the -mountain- woman with a big bag of almond joys. It's hard to remember the full conversation so I'm going to do my best.


She said something along the lines of ""Almond joys are the most healthy candy because it has vegetables in it""


Holy fucking beetus. We never once talked to eachother and that's what she says. I kinda just stare and she says


""First of all chocolate is a vegetable and with the coconut and almonds make them healthy!""


I just say alright and start taking my stuff to the counter. She gets behind me in line and she takes another almond joy off the checkout candy rack and tries offering it to me.


""You should be healthy like me teehee""
 

At this point im getting dumbfounded. I'm a ~young~ man and sometimes exchange a few words with some of the older ladies that are in the store to be nice, but this is getting wierd. I decline and she looks kinda annoyed.


I pay for my stuff and leave the store and like I always do, I stand outside for maybe 30 seconds to get my bags and wallet organized for my walk back home. This gives AJJ enough time to catch up with me. As I walk away from the store I hear


""SKINNY BOY! I HOPE YOU GET FAT""


At this point I start speedwalking because I don't know what a beast of these lands are capable of.


She drives up next to me at the parking lot exit where I'm about to get onto the sidewalk and rolls down the window. She grunts with a scrunched face at me.


""NNNNNNGGGNNNUUUUUUUU"" and she drives off.


I walk home and sell the candy to my sibling and have a diet coke.


Right now I'm awed to know that something like that would happen in my lifetime. This won't stop me from going back to the store but it will definitely give me an adrenaline rush by just walking into the store, knowing i might come face to face with AJJ again. That's why this story is called The AJJ Chronicles, I may see her again and have you guys a part two.

I want to hear some stories of guys who were once in good shape, but got fat because they didn't do anything about these habits. Maybe it happened to you, a friend, etc.

fatpeoplestories,"This morning I was at a local supermarket buying some groceries. This particular supermarket has self serve checkouts, which are watched closely by staff due to a spree of shoplifting that occurred when they were first installed.


As I am preparing to pay I hear a staff member call out behind me and ask ""Excuse me are you going to pay for those?"". Knowing full well that I scanned everything and have nothing in my pockets, I turn my head over my left shoulder to speak for myself but I realise that the question was directed at the register to my right and not to me. Oh well, not my problem, I turn back to my register to complete my purchase and go on about my day.


&gt; No I don't have to pay for them, I need them


wut


I turn to my right and would you believe it, a rotund lady is in the process of placing a large bag of gummy bears into her handbag and not into the bagging area with the rest of her scanned items.


&gt; I have diabetes I need to eat every two hours.


Immediately my mind goes to r/fatpeoplestories and how I never imagined I would encounter such harebrained fatlogic in real life. Yet here in my hometown is a woman who is attempting to steal a bag of gummy bears because of her ""cundishun"".


&gt; If I don't have these I could collapse and die. So I need these.


I try to swipe my card to pay for my items but I flat out miss the card reader because my attention is so invested in this exchange. I must listen closely and observe. For science.


This is when it all goes wrong. Instead of denying the patient her prescription of gummy bears, or at least asking for a manager to clarify store policy, both of which would have likely resulted in a delicious meltdown, the staff member (probably also aware of the impending meltdown) simply lets out a submissive ""oh okay"" and returns to her post looking at the floor.


Satisfied, the large lady pays for her other items and leaves with her chin(s) held high.


And that is the end of the story.

fatpeoplestories,"Hi all, S again. 


Be me, if you want. 5’1”, 139, slightly overweight lesbian.
Or be British, my coworker. 5’6”, 180? Hired same day as I was, kind. Expat, hence the name.
Definitely don’t be one of the two types of employees I describe here.


I got a new, much more stable job with a huge multinational company! Free parking, commute is a bit better, and I know the contract won’t just come out from under me next week like it could at my previous work.


The best thing, though? New employer is a shitlord on a policy level! There are fitness classes on-site over most lunch periods, full locker and shower rooms, and incentives to bike to work. Also, two cafeterias, which serve a huge variety of food varying in amount and healthiness. But, you can get one of several  healthy options regardless of who the food vendors of the day/week are, and the online menu page lists calories for every single thing! Same with the actual menu boards. I don’t need the health insurance since it’s better through my wife, but I heard it’s also good and offers discounts for gym attendance and so on. Work itself is also huge and a lot of walking just to get to and from your desk.


This, however, has led to an interesting “split” in the employees. Probably 60% are normal weight, 20-30% are huge, and the rest are just overweight; many of the latter use the workplace programs to make better choices.


But...I just don’t understand. I’m so glad to be somewhere that values health, yet I have an obese manager (nice and competent and all, but still), and see some people working nearby who are large enough to need canes and not be able to take the stairs.


We work on the second floor, guys.


The same people who are so large are also the same ones who choose the unhealthy foods, don’t move around on breaks, and don’t do any fitness classes or initiatives.


There’s so much help and making the good choice easy, at work. I just want to shake these hams and yell at them not to waste all these great options! I certainly am not. Been here three and a half weeks and dropped five pounds! I just...HOW? I grew up sailing. This is like *not* taking the life ring someone throws you after you’ve fallen overboard. Like tacking against the prevailing wind.


I guess it’s true, the proverb about leading a horse to water.


The one thing that makes this situation less frustrating is British. I told her that I was going to the fitness classes over lunch, and even though she has a ways to go and hasn’t gone to such classes in a few years, she gamely decided to join me (Okay, I may have begged a bit so I didn’t have to look stupid by myself in front of coworkers, but still). She’s in her fifties, and decided, no time like the present. Even asked about my new habit of planning all my week’s meals and how I set calorie goals with my Fitbit.



She’s lost seven pounds.

fatpeoplestories,"Me: 185cm about 108kg.  Also alcoholic.  I may be fat but i go the gym 5-6 days a week but i also drink 6-10 beers + whisky most days.

I decided today to swing over to the bar for a half dozen pints.  Then some good ol' taco time today for some cheap tacos trying to nurse the tired hangover im feeling after drinking till 2 ish (tbh idk liquor) and working the next morning.

I throw my order in and fuck it i want a smoke so i go outside and puff away.  Go back inside and my order aint done yet so i go for another this is when it starts.  Im outside looking at ""shit"" on my phone and kinda looking around when a fat bitch (no way she didnt have 20kg on me) and her boyfriend/friend/idkw pull up and park.

They get out and walk past and she says loudly enough for me to hear ""fucking disgusting"".  As i am naturally antagnostic i say ""what is?""

Then she goes off about how smoking is a disgusting habit and that i am a gross person.  I tell her to look at herself and that there is no way she needs taco time.  She freaks out and says that i am going to die from smoking and that i deserve it lol.  As i finish the second smoke i pull out my pack light another and say ""well fuck id rather die from smoking than live a life as fat as you are"" then light up.

Cue more yelling and me not really caring.  He gets her to go inside and order.  I ramble in and grab my order while i see the workers working feverishly making food.  I grab a whole shit ton of hot sauce and meander out while she stares daggers at me.  I stick out my tongue for good measure and drive home to actually start drinking.  Cue shots/drinking from the bottle.

Sorry if this comes off as fat hate but i wouldnt have said shit if she didnt start it.  I know i will die young but have accepted it because i do stupid shit for fun.  Keep your judgement to yourself and i wont call you out on not knowing how to control eating.

The other day we went to the ballet together and just before the show started, the previously empty seat next to her was (over)filled by a man only slightly larger than my mum. Her reaction was priceless. She was shooting him dirty looks and huffing about him over flowing into her space. She was already crushing me in my seat at this point too. During intermission, she whispered to me that good daughters would swap with their mothers. I turned to her and whispered right back that I must be a crappy daughter then because there was no way I was swapping. I would have disappeared under the overflow from them both if I'd been crushed between them.

She spent the second half of the show huffing again and then the subsequent car ride home complaining about how rude that man was and how he should have sat in an end of row seat. I love my mother dearly but she has ZERO self awareness. ",Hamplanets collide
fatpeoplestories,"... why? why do so many fat people think the way they do? I mean, don't they see they can't even go up a staircase without almost fainting? can't they see they can't even look at food without eating it as fast and as much as they can, even if it isn't theirs? can't they see they're not healthy and their health problems are mostly because of being too fat? can't they see they let their children make this poor life choice?

my dad told me about a friend of his with who, one day, he was having lunch. his friend asked him

""why do you eat so little?""

""I don't eat too little, I eat until I feel I'm satisfied.""

""why? do you underestimate food?""

""no, man. I don't underestimate food. the measure of how much I eat is how much makes me satisfied, not how much food we have in the dinner table. if you feel the urge to eat all the food you have, cook for only one meal, you don't have too cook for a week and eat it at once. you can always store things in the fridge to eat later.""

my dad's friend understood and lost a lot of weight after this talk. maybe people are that fat because they think it is natural to eat that much? or maybe they think they're entitled to food, or they can't ""underestimate food"", like my dad's friend? why can't they see it is a problem?",about fat people logic

fatpeoplestories,"This is really slow going, because I only have one hand to type it with at the moment, but you all deserve a nice juicy snack here.

I met up with someone the other day, a mutual friend of a few of my friends, I never met her personally but I was posting on some social media accounts that I was going to check out one of the local hiking trails and I was looking for someone to come check it out with me.  I'm visually impaired and also have some mobility issues related to various disabilities that are not important here.  But the main reason I didn't want to go alone was so that someone could assist me a little, nothing major just point out things that might be in my path that I don't notice etc.

Anyway I don't really see well enough to notice that this girl is big, but she says she is really looking to get in shape and that makes me think she'd be a good friend to have.  So the day arrives and I arrive at the place we've agreed to.  

Now guys this was only gonna be like a 30-45 minute walk at most, I don't have the energy or strength to do much more than that at a time.  This girl texts me when it's 15 or so minutes past when we were gonna meet to say she got stuck in traffic but she is gonna stop at mcdonald's real fast do I want something.  I decline, say i'd already eaten, plus mcdonald's does not agree with my stomach most of the time.

I wait and wait, I would have started walking but I've only got a certain amount of energy, (if I day spoons would you all get that?), so I just chill and listen to music on my phone.

An hour after we agreed to meet she shows up, she is stuffing her face with some monstrosity of a biscuit from mcdonald's and has a large drink which I can tell does not have water in it.  She laughs saying she was gonna be on time but she forgot to eat and that it would be important to keep our strength up on this walk.  

So then I do some stretches before we start to go, she continued to stuff her face and make horrible chugging noises and wipe her mouth on her sleeve....oh that reminds me!

She was wearing this horrid bright pink tank top and sweat pants, they were stained in the arm pits and it was clear she'd at one point had her period in those pants and not been able to remove the stain properly.

So we start to walk towards the trail, its like a park and you walk along it which is just beside a river, and its like half a mile until you get to the start of the actual walking trail.  This part of the trail is paved nicely, there are benches along it and all that, I don't even need her help for this part of the walk.  

It takes us an hour to walk half a mile!!

She has to stop at almost every bench to catch her breath, grab some snack out of her backpack and eat it and then we move on....to the next bench!!

When we get to the trail I see that I'm gonna have to just leave because I have something else to do and what should have been less than an hour of my morning has taken up closer to 3.  

She thanks me for the walk, says we should do it again sometime, but that it's good we got tired when we did (teehee!) because that hiking trail looked really scary....oOoOoOo!!

Ughh what a waste of a perfectly good morning right?

Anyway as we are walking back down she trips on something, her own fat feet I'm not sure, but I genuinely wanted to help steady her.  So she grabs hold on me and she falls, we both go down, she falls on me in such a way that she falls onto my other arm, all her weight on it.

Going to the ER later confirms her fat ass broke my arm.

So she wasted my entire day instead of just my morning.

So some years back she was ""sick"" one day, she laid in her recliner and could barely even talk. She would just mumble ""Ithhhiicck"" which translates as ""I'm Sick."" That went on most of the day until the phone rang. As soon as I answered it I was greeted with a cloud of thick cigarette smoke and the scent of cheap booze. It was her sister, Saturn. I gave the phone to the Hamplanet. She slowly raised it to her head and weakly rasped out ""ello?"" Now this next part happened so fast, It is hard to describe. First I felt a great rush of air next to me, then I saw flaming footprints heading upstairs  to her bedroom, I watched as a dust cloud in her gelatinous form  vanished before my eyes. Then I saw a blur leaving the same flaming footprints head out the door and to her car, which took off like a rocket. I grabbed the phone which was still hovering in midair. Later on I found out that Saturn wanted her to go out gambling with her. Funny how that healed her and was able to make her move faster than she has been able to before. Normally continual drift could move faster than her. 

The point is that she is one of these ones that plays things up over the top, trying to get sympathy. ",Hamplanet Mother and the Miracle Recovery.

I realized I didn't make it clear in the last few stories, but I haven't talked to my sister in **2 years.** Not since she [tried to sabotage my engagement](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/41i0du/update_apparently_im_on_a_sex_site/?st=jhm5e48t&amp;sh=c2f46681). And yet she charged her food to my room.

Anyway, I just had lunch with my aunt today. The aunt who ended up paying for the $550 meals my sister charged to my room. As per your requests, I tried subtly asking if she had an itemised list of all the food my sister ordered.

&gt;My aunt replied, ""I *was* getting ready to fight with the hotel and ask for an itemised list. Over $300 for room service in a day? Are you crazy?! It must be a mistake! But once I found out it was your sister, I didn't bother fighting it. I just paid. I believe it. I don't even need to see the itemised list. I've seen her eat since she's small. She can eat that much.""

My aunt then started musing on how my parents managed to let my sister's appetite grow to that size. I reminded her that when we were kids, [no one believed me when I would try to tell them my sister stole my food](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/5xzonl/how_my_sister_grew_up_to_become_the_monster_she/?st=jhm57vqg&amp;sh=ce858255).

I'm having lunch with my dad tomorrow, I'll try to see if he has an itemised list, but I'm not that hopeful. I'm hoping I'd get crazier stories about my sister though.

fatpeoplestories,"This is clearly a throw away, its to keep myself safe, but someone said you all might appreciate this.

Baby star is my roommate....I have 5 other roommates, but they are not important.  Some of us are fat, some of us are thin, some of us have only one leg, (true story), but none of those other people are important to the story, so we'll just talk about baby star.

We all live together because we met on a kink friendly site and we decided to live together.  Baby star was not one of the original roommates but someone who used to live here has moved on in life, so she applied to live here.

Basically we are normal people but for various reasons would feel more comfy living with non judgemental people when it comes to our lifestyle choices....any way none of us are important, just baby star, suffice it to say we sometimes do weird things within our own home, but we've all consented to them so it's whatever.

Baby star is not massive, but she is fat, and she does eat CONSTANTLY, to ""keep up her sugars and all that jazz"".  Baby star is a pathological liar.  About almost everything.  We hear her on skype talking to people all the time and she pretends she has cancer...she has a rare type of diabetic that requires her to eat all the time or she passes out...I have seen her fake pass out for them and heard them urging her to just take one more bite of her candy bar or go fix something else to eat....and they sound genuinely worried, (I think they might not be too intelligent, or don't know enough of the situation).

Let's see.....baby star likes to dress up like an adult baby....this would not be so bad, but she also wears giant diapers....and she shits in them.  Now we are alright with this, just go change yourself you know?

So Baby star earlier today as an example, decided to make some brownies, but then decided that the batter looked too good, so she stood there and ate the entire batter from the bowl, all while humming the sponge bob theme song loudly between sloppy bites of batter.  Then she left the bowl in the sink.  She also shit herself right in the kitchen and it exploded the diaper.  Basically it was like the brownie batter went right through her.

At this point the only mention I'll make of any of us roommates is that one of us, our kink is to be a domestic servant, and this person refused to clean up Baby star's mess and she had a shit fit, (no pun intended, but take it anyway :P ).

Anyway now Baby star is wearing a new clean diaper and is sitting on the living room couch.  She has in the past hour or so eaten:

1.  A medium pizza from dominos
2.  an entire serving of chicken wings
3.  2 bags of 3 muskateer miniture candy bars, probably is like 15 in each bag or so.
4.  A can of chili loaded up with all sorts of shit.

she stinks so bad, I want to write more on here but I need to figure out how or if it's even wanted here....she is clearly mentally ill and in need of help.  But god that woman...

We are trying to get her to move out but its gonna be a few months.  In the meantime, do you all want to or is this in the category of making fun of a mentally ill fat person?",baby star semi nsfw

So, my husband found an additional $90 charged to our room, so I had to contact the hotel and asked for the bill. It was signed by my dad and turned out to be an honest mix up, but he sent me over the bill for his room &amp; my sister's room. There was an additional charge for **$262.72** over 2 days. 

To give you an idea how crazy this is, my parents, who also took one of my cousins out for dinner once, only spent **$295** during their *entire stay*.

So here's the total for her food bill if you combined what she charged to my room &amp; her room:

* 03/12: $67.36 
* 03/15: $94.26 (day I arrived, already serving buffet style meals served 6x/day)
* 03/16: $363.35  (buffet style meals served 6x/day)
* 03/17: $289.60 (day I left in the morning, so $154.36 was charged to her room. Still serving buffet style meals served 6x/day)

Total: **$814.55**

There's a gap of 2 days where she didn't order anything, and I suspect it's because it was filled with family activities. 

I arrived on the 15th, and I guess she tested out charging just one meal first and then went berserk when she realized she could get away with it. I suspected she tried charging all $289 to my room on the 17th, only to be told I've checked out. 

I guess her regular amount of food is ~$300 of additional food on top of a normal person's 3 meals. The free flow of buffet food is provided from the 15th to the 17th btw. I have no idea how she survived the days before that if this is how she normally eats.

Oh yes. And she got my parents to pay the bills for her room, and my aunt to pay for the bills charged to my room.

She's 28.


**EDIT:** My dad literally just updated me to tell me my sister was at the dinner with my cousin. So $295 was worth 6 normal meals. If you're assuming meals there cost $50/person on average (probably not that much, my dad tends to tip generously while my sister doesn't), she ate 16 additional meals over 4 days when there's free flow of food going on.

This is about 2012. I just got out of a huge mindfuck of I guess what I could call a relationship. I still don’t know what it was.

Combine a very minimal income, so very unhealthy,  food with psychiatric medication, and I saw my weight go from 180 pounds of relative muscle and a tallish frame to over 300 pounds. I was so fat the idea of wearing 4x clothes was my reality. I was that guy in plane seats that needed the belt extender.

I walked a lot, but I still had man\-boobs bigger than many women. But one of the best thing about that relationship ending was the anger\-\- it really motivated me to go work out. I wanted to change myself, not just my body, but my very mindset.

I had been treated like a piece of shit because I was fat, like somehow, anything I got was pity, and anything I gave was second rate. So I started with lifting. I had lifted before, I was relatively strong at the end of high school, and had spent some time in the weight room.  I knew the basics.

For a few months, I just lifted the bar, I was getting stronger and was excited to see what my body could do. I was able to get past DOMS and excuses, and just keep going back. Then when I got down to about 250, because my body had nothing to lose but fat after breaking out of the homeostasis of 10 years of psych meds, bad food, and sedentary behavior, I was dropping fat\-\- I then started running because I wouldn’t blow out my knees now that I wasn't so heavy.

I got to the point where I would run 8 miles after lifting for an hour. It was at this point I felt secure enough to start dating. Not just because of the weight lost, but I was able to get the mindfuck martini that was my ex out of my head.

So, I met this lady on OKC. A bit younger than me, but into stuff like horror fiction, cute face, and busty. I’m a sucker for a well\-endowed woman.Her picture was an hourglass figure. Pretty face. But it looked like a polaroid photo,  which was strange\-\- because even in 2012, cameras on phones and cheap, but quality digital cameras were easily accessible.

After talking on the phone, we hit it off. The problem was, first date out, she was much larger than her photo\-\- which was several years out of date.. That seemed deceptive to me, but I rationalized it.  I’m one of those people who take people as they are. I try not to judge. Especially with a cleft\-palate and male\-pattern baldness I just don’t feel like I get to be overly critical of other people’s bodies or faces.

It was fine, until she couldn’t handle the fact that I worked out a lot. For her, that activated something in her\-\- a sense of insecurity. I would have just let her deal with it and been compassionate, but she reflected it onto me.So there would come the snide comments about my body.

She was Black, I was White\-\- she would talk shit about the way my ass turned red in the hot shower. It’s science\- there are capillaries back there \(it was a skin\-tone difference\).

She would feel my arm, and say “Oh, I expected that would be a lot squishier than it is\-\- your chest looks firmer, but it's not.”

And despite having a good hour of sex \(pushups plus cardio meant that I didn’t get tired\), she would ask me “If you ever get a six pack, would you find me attractive?” I just responded,""Honey, why would me having lower body fat determine how attractive I find you?""

Well, I had no problem with her body, considering we had gone at it for an hour, as we did every date night.So, here she was, this woman who kept negging me, despite lying in her photo, despite having a decent amount of fat on her, talking shit about my body was a way to keep herself feeling okay about her own body.

When she told me that her ex was sending her dick pics. She talked about opening up the relationship and how she just wanted to keep her options open. I knew I didn't want to get stuck in that trap and told her “Look, you obviously aren’t into this relationship. I can’t force you to be. I don’t know what your self\-esteem issues are, but I’m not going to be caught in the middle while you work through them. Have a good life.”

And despite talking shit about me, she kept trying to insert herself into my life. She kept trying to call me, and I just would ignore her messages. She left stuff over at my apartment, and kept trying to use that as an excuse to come over.

I had to give it to her\-\- she had this delusion that she was going to come inside. She had only gotten bigger, and I had only gained more muscle and lost more fat. But despite her insecurities, it was the mindfuck that made her unattractive.

I literally would have preferred to go to a coffee shop and read a good book than spend any time with her\-\- but it was because she was an asshole, not because she was fat.","Fatfishing and then negging. I'm good, thanks."
fatpeoplestories,"I’ve noticed the overspill of large people at the mall and it is so frustrating to have to walk around them simply to just get from one place to another.

It used to be that an aisle in the mall could have two rows, each moving in opposite direction with maybe two people (4 total give or take) walking abreast of each other. Now, the one aisle is taken up by two large people who not only waddle at like .25 miles per hour but refuse to move to the side to accommodate others.

I mean I get it, some people are large and they walk slowly and have trouble getting around. But why are they so self unaware that they don’t realize that people stall and basically have to halt behind them so they can travel in groups together. They simply do not care.

It is incredibly frustrating.

I should also mention that I don’t visit the mall often and it hasn’t been until recently (last two months or so) that I’ve been shopping in person vs online. I live in a very fit and health conscious area. And even so, the number of fat people is astounding. Teens, children, middle age, 20 somethings - everyone is fat. Wtf happened.",Traffic jams
fatpeoplestories,"Hello again, darlings!  I'm back with more encounters!  Before we get into things, I'm going to define some stuff.

**Page**: This is the entry level position at most libraries.  Generally teens and college age people work this position.  Basic duties include putting books away, emptying drop boxes, and boxing up donations and discards for either library sales or outreach programs.  I worked as one from 2003-2006, bounced around a few jobs after a millage failure and subsequent letting go of all lower level workers, and then came back in 2008 until my promotion to reference in 2015.

**Circulation**: The main area where you check out books.  I sub, and work there once every 3 weeks on rotation.

Now, onto what you came here for!

**Halloween Hams**

The library is located only a couple blocks away from subsidized housing.  The area isn't the best, though it's trying to improve.  As a result, most people with kids prefer to take them to ""trunk or treat"" events and local businesses for Halloween festivities rather than let them run off through the rough neighborhoods.  On Halloween, we have a pumpkin bowl of candy at circulation and at the children's desk for any trick or treaters.  Which is good because many adults will just stick their hand in the thing and take whatever they want.  We'd let them take a piece or two if they asked.  But by far the worst are the hams.  Two years in a row one woman had her kids distract us with checkouts while she tried to make off with the whole bowl.  Were it not for other patrons calling her out, she would have made it.  Just last year, a very large man waddled his way in, huffing and puffing as I was holding out the bowl for some kids to pick some candy.  He spotted me right away. 

""OOH, CANDY!"" he shouted, and with a speed I didn't think possible, he was nearly on top of the kids his huge fist jammed in the poor pumpkin.  He couldn't get it out.  He had to let go of the fistful of candy and pick them out one by one.  We only let him because he grabbed them so hard he smashed what he had touched.  He then tried to get more on his way out, but I put the pumpkin away as he was walking up, eagerly searching for it.

**Sphere**

I haven't had much interaction with Sphere, but I'm putting this here because I have no idea how this guy is able to walk.  He's perfectly spherical.  I've seen my fair share of FUPAS and odd proportions, but this guy is a literal sphere.  Even his arms and legs are stubby, like you'd expect.  Part of me just wants to push him over and play the Katamari Damacy soundtrack.

**Your money's no good**

Summertime.  Everyone worms their way back to the library for free events, summer reading prizes, and air conditioning.  Naturally, it's generally the time we see a lot of debtors.  Now, library fines are usually pretty easy to handle....until you lose a book.  We charge you the replacement price for that book/item, and if you have a lot of lost stuff on your card?  It adds up.  Our policy is that your total fines have to be under $5 to check out or use a computer.  

So, one hot summer Saturday, I have to process a new card for this very big woman.  She insisted on sitting at the end of the desk where we issue new cards even though she was in the system and that doesn't require paperwork.  Everything was going too smoothly, because as soon as I finished typing in her name, the computer buzzed at me.  $60 in fines/lost items.  It's nowhere near the worst I've seen, so I let her know.  After a good 3 minutes of explaining and her getting more and more irate, she finally decides to pay.

She proceeded to reach inbetween her barely covered breasts and pull out a soggy looking clump.  It was a small roll of money.  She thrust the wad at me grunting to give her change.

I backed up and said flat out, no.  With an irritated grunt, like I was a teacher/boss making her do something, she peeled 3 20s off the wad and slapped them on the counter.

""Here.""

I issued the card, and she left.  We had latex gloves in the back.  I put on 3 pairs, put the ""money"" in two ziploc baggies, and stuck a note on it.  I didn't get in trouble.",Library Tales 2: Electric Boogaloo
fatpeoplestories,"It's been a while, hasn't it? I'm willing to bet 90% of you reading this haven't seen my Customer Ham saga that I began nearly 5 years ago that I never really wrapped up. Why? Well, life got in the way. I graduated university, got a very intense (but rewarding) job that allowed me to travel, got married, adopted a senior doggo who has the energy of a puppy (wtf), and just other life stuff in general that made me forget about Reddit.

So the long story short of customer ham: I started my first job at 15 and it was in retail. Worked a lot all through school, and part of university so I spent a lot of my free time there. Customer Ham was a large, planet status man who was slightly (very) creepy and hated my boyfriend. Made every excuse under the sun as to why he was thicc with curvez. Tried to tell me veganism was bad. Catfished some poor, unsuspecting girl at uni and abused her when things didn't go his way.

You know, the whole hammy shebang. 

Well it's been many, many years since I'd seen CH, and those were some peaceful years. 

But...

You'll never guess who I saw the other week.

That's right, my friends. Our greasy old pal, CustomerHam. 

I attended a friend's art exhibition in town a few Saturdays ago. It was a beautiful night of free wine, cheese, and it was an excuse to dress up and get out of the house. T (my boyfriend from my stories, now husband!!), accompanied me and we were having a good time. The room was packed with people admiring some beautiful art.

Well, that was before the rumble. The earth started to move, birds flocked to safety and...

Wait, no. That didn't happen. And you may ask why. 

You're definitely asking why.

Well, T tapped me on the shoulder as I spoke to one of my friends.

&gt; T: Huhubelp, is that CustomerHam?

He pointed to a man who had is back turned to us. He was 5""4, with a stocky, build, but he looked good. Maybe around the 200 pound mark? The man wore a nice, suede jacket and designer brand pointed leather shoes. He was dressed to the nines as he spoke to a beautiful woman next to him. They laughed throughout their exchange and sipped their wines while gesturing to a piece made by one of the other artists.

&gt; Me: -Laughing- Now that's a name I haven't heard in a while. What a joke.

&gt; T: No, seriously, I think it is. Just wait until he turns around.

Well, he didn't turn around, not yet anyway. I thought T was having me on, trying to have me believe that this well dressed, not at all hammy man was THE Customer Ham. The man who weighed over 350 pounds that shattered a bakery display case just years ago. The man who once asked me for a ride to his car because he didn't want to walk across the uni campus.

What? No way! That was silly. Customer ham was a planet, a neckbeard a-

And then he turned around.

Guys. My face. I just....

What?! 

My friends didn't know what had gotten into me. One of them picked my jaw up off the floor as the other snapped her fingers in front of my face to get my attention.

How did this happen?

WHEN did this happen?

I suppose a lot changes in 6 years. Because Customer Ham looked *good.* He looked healthy, and he looked happy. He didn't have the sad, pained look in his eyes that longed for a different life anymore. He carried himself with confidence as I watched him interact with other human life. An interaction that didn't look forced, or uncomfortable. 

I didn't go up to him and re-introduce myself. T and I both agreed that if he did recognise me, it might bring up a sore spot for him. Nobody likes looking back on a time when they were a worse version of themselves, it hurts. It's embarrassing, and I didn't want to make him think about it. Not when he looked like he was having the time of his life.

So there it is, I guess I have some form of closure now, knowing that CH is a better version of himself. I'm happy for him, and if you remember my old tales from years ago, I hope you are too!",Customer ham part 10: 4 (nearly 5) years later
fatpeoplestories,"LONG time lurker, first time poster. This is gonna be a short one, but I have a story and I want to share it with all my fellow people with fat people stories.

First off, I’m a guy, 25 years old, 6’2-6’3, and about 140 pounds. I’m very skinny, to the point where I’m self conscious about it and have been trying to stick to a 3200 calorie per day diet, so I can gain some weight and muscle at my very physically intensive job. Size 28 waist, somewhere between size medium-large slim fit for shirts because I’m so tall. I suffered with serious eating disorders from ages 12-18 because I learned the behaviours from my mother. My mom is the type of woman who always restricted her eating, and would comment about how “fat” she was getting. For reference, she’s 5’0, and she’s never ever been more than 125 pounds in her life. She is a wonderful person, and everything but the eating habits she’s taught me has made me a smart, well rounded adult.

I drive a small car. My friends have referred to it as “a mom car” on many occasions. The other day I was headed to the mall with my friends, we were going to play bowling. One of my friends brought somebody with him, and this person was about 5’5, 280-300 pounds if I had to guess. Full blown hamplanet. This is when things get fucked up... we had to go over some speed bumps with them in the back seat. 

Again, I have a very small car. The shocks are only really gonna handle so much before they bottom out and we start scraping, and that’s exactly what happened. There is now MASSIVE scrapes in the frame along the sides which are beginning to rust, just from us scraping on this day. It sounded like my car just went along a bench grinder, but really it was just 2 or 3 concurrent speedbumps. 

I want to confront them about it.. I want to straight up tell them they caused probably $2000 worth of damage to my car... but how am I supposed to do it? How am I supposed to be like “You’re so big you caused my car to scrape along the frame and now due to all the snow/wetness gone and it being hot out (as it’s summer now basically) it’s beginning to rust, and may eventually break over time.”

It’s not a small scrape. It’s about as big as the entire back door on the underside of the car. I can post pictures in the comments if you need the reference. 

What in the fuck am I supposed to do? I don’t think fat person damage is covered under my warranty.

TL;DR: Hamplanet caused my car to scrape multiple times causing permanent damage that could possibly lead to over $10,000 worth of repairs on a car I’m still paying for for 2 more years and I can’t figure out how to confront them about it. 

EDIT: Here’s the picture of the damage. Maybe I’m exaggerating, I don’t know too much about cars honestly, but it looks pretty serious..

EDIT 2: I’m aware this is my problem, you don’t have to remind me. I don’t know how to talk to fat people about being fat in a way that isn’t going to end in “but muh condishuns!!” etc. That’s what this post is about. **I wanna be able to tell this person why they can never get in my car again without being a complete asshole and hurting their feelings.**","My poor, poor car: A story about weight limits."
fatpeoplestories,"I barely buy myself food outside because I’m trying to lose weight but today I went out with my boyfriend and I bought food but didn’t finish it (it was a lot of food) so I brought it home to eat it later. I left it in the kitchen then head to my room to take a nap. I wake up 2 hours later and feel kinda pecking, so I go get some leftovers except there is mysteriously less. I find my ham (slowly but surely becoming hamplanet) brother asleep on the couch so I wake him up to ask him if he ate it since he’s the only one home. He had the audacity to say “Why does it matter? I only ate a little”. How is eating almost all of the food I brought only “a little”? You ordered food already dude, more than enough for three people, but still find the need to take my food and not apologize. I don’t get it.

fatpeoplestories,"I have 2 younger half siblings, 10 (A) and 9 (B) and they are overweight. It's heart breaking because my mom is also overweight and my other sister (20) has been for her while life but my other sister is working on losing weight and finally is doing really well.

My mom always says to the sister that is losing weight that she's doing so well and is so proud of her and she has also told my younger siblings that they are fat. Because they are. It wasn't meant to hurt, it was so they knew why the are put on 'diets' by my mom that only last the day.

Recently there have been some issues with custody over my half siblings and they have always been allowed to help themselves to whatever unhealthy food my mom constantly buys. 

Today my siblings got back from being at their dad's for the weekend and the A who has a foul attitude and unfortunately is not a nice child to be around in any circumstances, helped themselves to an ice cream. I told them that their dinner will be ready soon and they should wait or not have dessert if they want an ice cream now. They started lying to me about how at 6.30pm, all they had eaten today was an apple and water, I called bullshit and then found out that 'shockingly' A had been given more than an apple to eat all day. 

My mom overhears me telling A that they should eat something healthy and now I'm unsympathetic to how worried they are and I'm selfish and they are never fed properly at their fathers and they are so scared and worried about custody that I need to stop lecturing then because I 'delight' in causing them misery. She is literally just giving them carte Blanche to eat their feelings and get fatter! Whilst also telling the A to ignore me which furthers the horrible behaviour.

 It's infuriating because I am the only one that has managed to never be overweight in my family and the only one that will volunteer to look after the A and B because everyone in the family knows that A is a foul little brat and that they get away with awful behaviour because my mom has decided to live her life as an invertebrate. 

It's such a shame because B tries to be healthy and is a delight to be around but my mom is just fucking them over because she allows A to rule the roost and ruin everything for B because A is allowed to bully B and essentially control what my mom cooks by being a little cunt child.

fatpeoplestories,"EDIT: COME ON, GUYS! Read the post **before** giving your input ffs the amount of comments from people who didn't read squat is too damn high. 

Hey planets, happy long weekend! For those of you who aren't out camping and enjoying the hot weather, or for those of you unlucky enough to not get a long weekend (boo), I would like to open a discussion about allowing more image sources within this subreddit. 

We are working on a subreddit redesign, sidebar update, and fixing couple of bugs that users have pointed out in the report form. There's also a few hangups with switching to the Reddit re-design that will be worked on. 

With all of this going on, and with our former sister subreddit Fat Logic choosing to distance themselves away from FPS, the mods have been entertaining the idea of opening the allowance on images such as post and article screenshots that users believe would fit within our general theme. 

EDIT: since there seems to be some confusion on what I am referring to when I say ""image posts,"" I am referring to story images. No pics of fat people, no memes, relating only to screenshots of relevant posts such as those found elsewhere on Reddit (censored, of course), relevant articles, etc. This is what I am looking for opinions on. End of edit! 

We absolutely do not want this sub to turn into shitty Facebook meme posting, making fun of people's appearances just because, YouTube videos (I swear if people start posting Super Size vs Super Skinny video clips I will shut this idea down so quickly), or articles just saying ""fat is bad."" 

Before we really lay out the guidelines to this, as this may be a little tricky, we would like to hear from the members here. We want to know your opinion on whether or not you'd like images to be allowed (outside of the already-kosher /fit/ posts and other related stories), and what sort of freedoms and limitations you would like to see in place. We will be basing our actions off of user feedback. 

Please read the discussions and remember to vote on comments so we can properly gauge reactions by both comments and votes. 

If you have any other concerns or suggestions, now is the time and here is the place to voice them! Remember you are also always welcome to contact us via mod mail, by clicking ""message the mods"" in the sidebar or sending a private message to /r/fatpeoplestories. 

Happy chow down folks! ","HEY ALL, new announcement. Do you want to allow image posting? Discuss within!"
fatpeoplestories,"So I met this girl on (insert dating app) and right off the bat the profile...let's just say it didn't show the whole picture.  

Regardless, she listed some similar interests and the conversation was good online so we decided to meet up.  

I'm standing in front of the restaurant and she shows up.  Wearing all black but it's still pretty obvious.  Her face is aite, but I can tell from the start she was heavier than me (5'10, 170) and I'm not a small framed guy.   

Now granted, this was the first fat person I've ever dated.  I had a very open mind, almost guiltily so (more on this later).  We hit it off, date was great.  Sense of humor lined up, we enjoyed similar books and movies.  It was a great time all around.  A few more dates in, we end up getting frisky.  

This is when my open mind ran straight into a brick wall.  Everything felt...wrong.  

Wrapping my arms around her shoulder felt like I was bro hugging my closest buddies.  The size of her calf seemed to spread out the hair follicles, so it felt like I was rubbing legs with (again) a guy.   

But hey, it was my first time with a big girl.  Figured it was par for the course and I pretty much kept my mind forced open and did the deed.  

The sex wasn't great, but at the time it wasn't really a dealbreaker.  We were great company.  

It was when we went to sleep that I felt this was not going to work.  

I'm a bit of a light sleeper, but not to the point of lack of sleep or anything.  But this girl breathed like a big person...and this carried into sleep.  I felt the mattress rise and fall with every breath.  

So I thought, ok this is not practical for me.  I can't sleep with her breathing louder than I can hear myself breathing in my head.  

Then the kicker came in the morning.  She had sweat profusely through the night, soaking my sheets, comforter, even the mattress pad.  It was like someone detonated a water balloon under the covers.   

Open mind, meet biological responses.  

After this, we met a few more times but at this point my mind was clinging to our connection in spite of my body refusing to cooperate.   Again, I kept my mind forcibly opened.  There seemed to be hope because she very much represented that she was on her way to being healthier.  Always said she had salads for lunch and that she hit the gym 4 times a week.  

This continued for a few more weeks.  No changes except to my plummeting libido, which started to whip up huge feelings of guilt at the time.  ""Damn, I must be a heartless bastard.""  

I'm sad to say it did not end well.  It was very difficult to explain to her that while I really liked her as a person, I couldn't get over the fact I wasn't attracted to her.  Especially since we connected so well.

Safe to say she was very upset and dropped some emotional bombs on her way out.  Wasn't pleasant but at the time I couldn't blame her.  It was such a shitty situation all around.  

Despite my best of intentions, I ended up feeling like an asshole.   But at the end of the day, dating is complicated and a lot of work.  No need to add to the difficulty level.

But hey, I've learned more about myself in the process, and I'll forge ahead with a slightly less open mind.   

TL;DR: Dated a fat person with whom I felt a solid connection.  Could not physically get myself to look past her figure.

So I work in healthcare. To avoid HIPAA some things will be changed but not the important stuff. 

Maybe be me: 5'4"" 135lbs currently doing intermediate fasting and going to the gym when ya know I don't skip. 

There are many people in this story as I work in a building so I won't bore you with all of their stats. BUT

Lady; 5'1"" 305lbs. Lives in said building. Not even 50yo. 

Now my job is to take care of those who are too old or confused to do so themselves. There are exceptions of course we get those with disabilities that family members can no longer take care of ect. But. Lady is only here for one reason and one reason only.  She is too fat to take care of herself. Her daughter is an RN and chose to put her mother with us because she was tired of her sitting in a chair all day and not moving not even to use the restroom. So. She is with us. 

One day we were doing monthly weights on everyone. When she is weighed she finally tipped over 300lbs. Her solution.. goes and sits in a chair in the lobby and waits for our ADon to walk by, calls her over and this conversation happens

Lady: "" ADon your scales are wrong.""

ADon: ""no, they are correct they get balanced and checked monthly and everyone else weight is correct"" 

Lady: ""well I'm not that big"" 

ADon: ""I'm sorry Lady. You are. Now that you are aware of this maybe it's time to ask yourself do you NEED this or do you WANT this"" 

Lady: ""no, your scale isn't right. I want to be reweighed"" 

ADon: ""it is right but if you insist"" calls me closer ""will you walk with Lady to the other scale and get her weight"" 

Before I can answer Lady freaks out. ""YOU WANT ME TO WALK DOWN THERE. ITS TOO FAR"" 

ADon: ""it's not that far, you are able to walk, if you want to be reweighed, you'll have to walk down there"" 
(Our building has 3 different scales, one for each hall way. They never get moved as to help them stay balanced. And when we did her weight on the first scale we redid it 3 different times. And when I took her down to the second and it said the same thing 4 times she was very upset, oddly enough, with me, because it's totally my fault) 

This woman is so big when she walks down the hallway you can be in a different room, in our paperwork room behind doors, and still hear her huffing and puffing as she is coming to her room. When she gets to the bathroom she is so out of breath she actually has to wait a bit to do what she needs to because she can't catch her breath.  She is also so wide I can't get my hands around her to help her pull up her pants. It literally has to be done in 2 steps.  She can't wipe herself. She can't reach around to do so. When you tell her to pull up the front of her pants she acts like you've told her you are going to sacrifice her. 

Another time I remember really well was I was helping her get ready for bed. She says to me. 
""My knees hurt so bad I don't think I can walk to my bed"" 
(That's like 8 feet from the bathroom) 
I say to her ""your knees hold most of your body weight and for every pound you have it's 3-5 on your knees"" 
She gets angry. ""And what makes you think that is true"" 
Me still very calm, as that is my job. ""I'm in nursing school Lady, I'm not saying that you have to believe me."" 
Lady is now very angry. ""go get me a Wheelchair so I can go to bed"" 
Now she knows better. She is not allowed to use a wheelchair unless we can tell she is physically weak. 
So I say to her ""no Lady you have to walk to your bed. It's fine. I'm right here"" 
Angry at me she gets up we get her pants on and she walks to her bed. 

This woman blows my mind everyday I am at work. The logic she has. The way she chooses to live. It shocks me. I love my job. I love taking care of those who can't. But I am a firm believer in if you can then you will. Which Lady does not like very much. 

I have more on this woman but I feel like this is long enough. And it's more of a rant than a story I apologise. 

TLDR: lady lives with elderly because she too lazy to take care of herself and has fat logic you'd never believe ",We can hear you coming.

Let me preface this story with a little info:

I use to be friends with 2 girls in my junior year of high school, and the three of us will be the main subjects of this story. There's me, R (5'4 and about 145 pounds at the time (I've lost about 8 pounds since this all took place, and continue to try and lose weight), my (still) best friend B (a little under 5'1 and weights so little many often mistake her for being anorexic), and finally there's G our ex friend (about 5'3 and easily over 200 pounds). I want to refrain for calling G as many names as possible here cause I don't want to get angry and it effect the quality of the story so I'm going to be as straight forward as possible. In addition, a lot of the later half of the story was told to me by B so I'm just going off what I knew and what was told to me.

This story begins in the middle of junior year. Me, B, and G all had a same English class together in the morning, so while we weren't ever close before this, we soon grew to be inseparable friends. Every day we would come in early to class just to have extra time to talk together, and we'd linger as long as we could after class to talk. So naturally, you would understand why B and I were concerned when one day G comes in crying her eyes out.

We asked her what was wrong, and after some genuine concern, she let it slip, ""My step father is overworking me and beating me. Everyday he harasses me and I don't know what to do."" Of course, B and I freaked out, wouldn't you?? We tried to persuade her into telling someone at our school who could help, but she insisted that it wouldn't work and would just make everything worse for her. I know at this point I should have seen red flags, but B and I came from some shady backgrounds ourselves and were way too gullible to a sob story. The stories of her abusive father went on for weeks. Everyday she had something new to share about him to us. ""He took my phone so I can't call the police on him."" ""He follows me around him his truck and won't stop until I'm back home."" It was hard to hear, and something had to give.

Eventually that something came when my friend B couldn't take it anymore (she's a super soft hearted individual), and convinced her parents to let G stay at her house. G of course was over the moon. The only catch was G had to do one of two things: A. Pay rent to live there (she had a job and at the time had absolutely no expenses, so it shouldn't have been hard) or B. Help do chores around the house. These rules were given to G cause B's guardian at the time, is/was a very old and fragile lady, who needs help supporting herself, so she couldn’t have had someone living with her that wouldn't at least help out a little. 

That aside the first month or so went smoothly from what I remember; they would take selfies, sleeping together, going out together, and would treat the whole thing like a sleepover. That is until some suspicious stuff started happening. You see slowly B started missing more and more days of school due to a mysterious illness she contracted. She would miss weeks at a time and when she was back she would have these awful rashes.

On top of that, G never lived up to the promises he made to help out around the house. Instead she would play on B's laptop all day everyday after school, then gorge on the family dinner (this girl didn't eat often, but when she did, let me tell you she ATE, B confirm to me she ate almost 6 steaks in one night), and afterwards she would go straight to bed without helping to clean up or even bother to take a shower.

Slowly things got worse still. B's little cousin had a birthday party that G crashed when she was caught eating 3/4 of the birthday cake (B had to go out and buy another one). G also slowly became a financial drain on B, constantly asking her to buy G stuff, but never spending her own money on something, (she used the excuse that her mom watched her bank account, so she had to ask permission before buying anything). There is much more, but it's trivial compared to what happened next.

One day the rash B had, had gotten so bad she had to be rushed to the E.R. and after spending a day there the doctor's figured out what was wrong with her. She contracted a staph infection without even knowing it. Of course B was freaked out, she's always be very careful about being clean and healthy she had no idea she got it.

Then the news hit her-- Staph could be contracted by being in contact with another person, especially if that person is unclean. G never took showers. Never washed her hands. Hell you'd think she was the wicked witch of the west based on how badly she avoided water. All this time, G had been the cause of B's sickness, and even when confronted with the actual medical evidence, she denied it and blamed B for getting sick (she said something along the lines of ""if you wouldn't scratch your face you wouldn't be sick!""). That doesn't even cover the audacity of what happened next though. 

You see not less that 24 hours after B got home, and she was getting her sheets washed (to get them cleaned of any bacteria), G walks up to B's guardian and says (and I can't make this shit up): ""So... We need to talk about getting some paperwork."" 

""What kind of paperwork?""

""Um... Adoption papers...""

At that point B's guardian LOST IT, she told G to point blank ""call your mom, pack your shit, and get out."" 

Of course G was wailing and throwing a pity party on Facebook and any other social media. She even tried to reach out to me for help but I already knew about the staph stuff (from B) and came up with a lame excuse why she couldn't stay. 

At some point though she did call her mom and strangely enough her mom wanted to talk to B's guardian. Okay weird.

As soon as B's guardian gets on the phone G's mom starts crying and profusely thanking her for ""giving her baby back"". (Or at least that's what I was told she said.) B's guardian is confused of course and accepts the thank you, but drills G's mom on the relationship she had with this ""abusive dad/stepdad"". G's mom is at a loss for words...

Now up to this point your wondering why did I post this all in r/fatpeoplestories, why not another subreddit? Why does it go here? Well dear readers this is why:

There was no stepdad/dad. G made it all up. G never knew her real dad! What actually happened was G is so fat her health issues caused her serious problems, so naturally her mom decided that the best course of action for this was to put G on a diet. G did not like this and after a lot of fighting G's mom told her ""if you don't want to lose weight pay your own medical bills!"". G got all in a huff and said ""I'll move out and find a new home!"". So she did. Her plan from the very start was to get mine or B's family to adopt her and put her on family health insurance, so she could continue living her piggy lifestyle without paying a dime! 

And that my friends is the reason why you should always be careful before opening your home to someone. (Also a big reason why I chose to start losing weight). I'm sorry this is messy, I'm not good at this at all. I hope it was passable though! Thank you for your time.

Edit: TL;DR - Girl fakes being abused for weeks, just to try and get adopted by another family and get put on their health insurance so she could continue to eat whatever she wanted without having to pay doctor fees. This backfires when after weeks of not showering my friend gets sick and is taken to the ER, and ALL of this person nasty choices come back to bite her.

fatpeoplestories,"There’s a girl in one of my classes who is pretty overweight, and she’s been talking about how she’s trying to lose and she’s been lifting at the gym. I’m thinking “yay, go you!” But then she starts talking about how she’s gaining weight and maybe she should “start counting her calories” but all she eats is “yogurt, granola, meat, and fruit and veg.” 

So today we had a short break in class and she pulls out a snack. She pulls out one of those full big TUBS of chobani yogurt, and dumps almost an entire freakin bag of granola on it. Lord help her. ",“I’m gaining weight and I don’t know why!”
fatpeoplestories,"So, I've worked at a public library/system for over 10 years.  Now, while libraries are excellent resources, because said resources are free, many, many kinds of people take advantage of them.  I've had my fair share of bad people, trashy people, but most importantly, fat people.  These are just a few short...experiences I've had with some planets being planets.

**Barefoot Ham**

Our dress policy is pretty lax for patrons.  Cover up your naughty bits, wear shoes.  So, as I'm checking in books one summer day, I hear a strange noise approaching.  *slap slap slap*  I look to my coworker, who is wearing the same baffled expression I am.  *slap slap slap*  It's getting closer.  Wild ham approaches!  Well, her children?  Babysitees?  (The kids were black, she was pasty white, though she did have a diaper only baby on her hip.)  It could have been a mix of both.  Ran past and into the children's area, causing a big uproar as they did so.  She wore far too short cut off jean shorts, a pink spaghetti strap tank top that was being enveloped by her shoulder fat, and no bra.  At first, we assumed the slapping was her massive boobs against her equally massive gut, but, as she finally approached the children's area, she appeared to have no shoes on.  My coworker called out to her, and she *slap slap slapped* her way over to the desk.  Not wanting to cause a scene, we informed her that she needed to wear proper shoes for hygiene reasons.

""I AM WEARIN' SHOES."" she screeched, and, bending over, putting her only a diaper baby on the floor, she grunted, removed something from her foot and shoved a crusty, yellow, flattest I have ever seen something in my life thong flip flop in our faces.  We both recoiled at the sight and smell, stammer out an apology as the diaper kid toddles toward the bathrooms.  With another, more angry grunt, the flip flop is returned, and the ham waddles her way to the nearby couch, screeching at the diaper kid to ""get the hell back here"".  Neither of us ate lunch that day.

**I thought that it was only a Spongebob joke**

When I was still a page, it was my main job to put the books that came in back on the shelves.  I was doing just that when I hear the mechanical whirring of what I assumed was an amigo- we have a couple for disabled patrons, and a few regular patrons who come in their own power chairs.  So, I turn my cart to give them room, and as I do, I see not one, but **TWO** blobs of people riding up in motorized hospital beds.  Now, I live in a small Michigan town.  The only other place I had seen this had been on Spongebob Squarepants.  I was dumbfounded, but, hey, they were making it work, probably?  No, they spied me with my cart of books and asked if I worked there.  I confirmed.  They demanded I follow them around and carry their books for them!

I told them no, that's not my job.  So they went to the reference librarian, who then tried to reprimand me because they told her I wouldn't get something off the top shelf for them.  She believed my side, but, I still had to follow the two around and pull stuff off the shelves for them because their beds only extended so high.  They stank of a mix of cigarette, urine, and antiseptic.

**DeathHam**

I saw DeathHam a lot over the years.  While still able to walk, he constantly stank of cigarettes and BO, and was also on oxygen.  He always wore the same clothes, a dark grey shirt and sweatpants, probably because the cig stains/ash blended well in it.  He was always trying to wheedle out of stuff, and make sure that everything he did was 100% free.  ""How much to use a computer?""  ""Why do you charge 0.15 cents a page for prints?  That's way too much!""  ""Why don't you allow food at the computers, I clean up after myself!""  ""Why don't you have snacks at (computer program)?""  The list of complaints goes on and on.

I only had one personal interaction with him.  I was pushing a cart full of boxes of discards past the computers.  He saw me, pointed at me with a filthy taloned fingernail, and did the ""come here"" finger beckon.  Why he couldn't just say ""excuse me"" is still beyond me.

DeathHam: Yeah, how do I get into (genealogy program)?

Me: You can sign up either on our website or at the reference desk.

DeathHam: Oh.  Hey what's in those boxes?

Me: Those are books going to the library sale.

DeathHam: I want to look.

Me: [looks back at the 6 large boxes that have been sealed.]  Sorry, but they've been sealed.  They'll be at the sale in a couple months.

DeathHam: I want to look now.  Open them.

Me: I'm sorry, I have other things to do.

He tried to lodge a complaint that I was ""withholding library materials"" from him on purpose.  But it didn't matter, because he died two weeks later.

fatpeoplestories,"I guess this a semi rant/semi story. 

I’m so sick of this happening. I’m on the subway, and was sitting in a two-seater. A wall on one side, with an armrest/grip bar on the other side. Needless to say, two average sized individuals can both sit comfortably, but anyone bigger will make things uncomfortable. (This wasn’t priority seating, either. Just a regular two seater).

I was in my seat, the one next to me vacant. A woman got on the train, easily 275lbs. She makes her way over to where I’m siting and points at the vacant seat and mutters “‘Scurse me.”

Now I know I don’t own that vacant seat. It’s the subway, no assigned seating and all that, but Jesus Christ have at least a SLIVER of spacial awareness! There’s no way we’re both going to fit here comfortably, and I was here first. What’s more, I get off at the very last stop on the line, I’ve got about an hour ride and I’m not spending it on my feet after a long day at work.

I scoot slightly, but still take up the space of MY seat. She attempts to sit, and half sits on my leg. She stands and turns to me again with a glare. “Ih said *’scurse me*”

She gets down lower and kinda shimmy/scoots into the seat. Now I gotta spend the whole damn ride with the arm bar wedged into my side with her mass touching all over me, or stand the whole way home. I think she thought I was just going to surrender the seat. Nope. I’m staying put. If I have to suffer whether I stand or sit, the last thing I’m gonna do is let you think this non-existent-personal-space tactic works.

We’re both visibly uncomfortable, and she’s huffing and side-eyeing me. Every time I shift even slightly, this woman takes it as an opportunity to shift into the space my body had just “surrendered”.  I can’t move.

Doesn’t there ever come a time where they think to themselves... that if you don’t fit comfortably in a seat that’s been the same size since they opened that damn subway, then maybe... *JUST MAYBE* you have a problem. 

I wouldn’t have minded as much if both seats were open and she took up both, that’s not as bad as subjecting someone else to your inability to remain in your own space. Sure I would have been annoyed, but it’s the lesser of two evils i guess.

I’m typing this with her next to me. I don’t care if she sees it. She can run home and fb status about her condishuns and discriminashun. No fucks given over here.",Tight squeeze on the subway... I’m so sick of this.
fatpeoplestories,"
My mom has had a problem with her weight since well before I was born. She developed gestational diabetes (Type 2) when she gave birth to me and has taken insulin since. 


Over the thirty two years since I came into the world, she has gotten down to a healthy BMI once, with the help of one of those powdered meal replacement shake diets. After she lost the weight, she went right back to eating the same crappy way that made her obese and SURPRISE, she gained it all back. 


I used to be obese, and I lost most of the weight in a very unhealthy way.  I was stupid and I’ll never resort to that again. I have now gotten control of my weight with the help of MyFitnessPal. I count calories and I have tried to explain the relatively simple process. I have unsuccessfully pleaded with her to just try it, because the app does all the counting for you! You type in your stats and it tells you exactly how many calories you need to eat to lose weight and at the same time consume enough energy so that you don’t feel deprived and spiral into a binge. 


She is one of those people who says things like “WHO uses the BMI scale? Who says it’s accurate?” and “Not everyone is the same! Everyone burns calories differently.” She’s also the person who usually doesn’t eat much in front of people but buys huge boxes of cookies and cakes from the sale shelf at the grocery store and eats the whole package in one sitting in her room. She stealthily buys fast food and eats full sugar ice cream. 


She has been having pretty extreme memory loss and diminishing lucidity (asking the same questions over and over again, not comprehending simple instructions) for a couple of years now and her doctor has scrambled for a diagnosis. She tested negative for Alzheimer’s, there’s enough iron and oxygen in her blood, her thyroid isn’t the culprit, it isn’t just normal dementia.


It’s from mismanaging her diabetes. She has had high blood sugar so many times/for long enough periods of time that she has effectively GIVEN HERSELF DEMENTIA. She did this to herself and I am so defeated, frustrated, furious and sad. My family is in turmoil because we are losing my mother. 


She was a brilliant woman. She has a masters in a STEM field and has done amazing things when women had many more obstacles than they do today. She was strong and witty and sharp and I feel such a great loss that I don’t know what to do. 


There is a glimmer of improvement, however, because she has started to buy sugar free ice cream and spent five minutes on the elliptical a week ago. Sadly, she is not at all as diligent with her diet and lifestyle as she should be, considering her MIND is at stake. 



",I’m just so angry.
fatpeoplestories,"I'm a trainer at a gym.  There is a program that a non\-fitness professional runs out of the business and it's target audience are, to put it as straight forward as possible, age 50\+ fat women who have never been active in their lives.  They sit on chairs and lift 2# dumbbells.

Don't get me wrong, it's never too late to improve your body.  I DO respect the program and I love the ladies in it.

But some of them are just so ignorant to physical fitness, it's hard not to laugh sometimes.

So this one lady comes in before class and is talking with the director of that program and me.  She wants to tell us how proud she is of herself for walking 10 miles.  I have to say, I was really impressed not only because she's 5 feet tall and 275 pounds at age 70, I would be impressed with anyone doing that!  She then describes that she was with her grand kids for a week and that was the total **for the week.**  Fit bit every day activity for the week.

Um...K.  But hey give her some encouragement and congratulate her with a nice hug.

A bit later, she seeks me out in the gym.  She grabs her giant roll with both hands and jostles it up and down once, saying, ""Is this my abs?""

I tried to hide my face from looking like she had just asked me ""Is this my dildo?"" and said, ""What?!""

She went on to explain that with all that walking, she wondered if the ache she felt in her ""abs"" was the ""muscle reacting to all the activity and is that how it feels when the muscle shrinks"".

Again, What?!

But first I asked her to describe the ache.  I needed to determine if it was injury pain or activity pain.  Sedentary people who suddenly become active are at high risk for injuries that wouldn't normally occur with normal healthy active people.

We determined it was not injury pain, so I started to explain, well, everything.  I struggled with how to delicately explain that she had in her hands a giant fat roll and not ""abs"".  

I explained the difference between fat and muscle, the different areas of ""abs"" and their functions \(trying to get her to understand that walking was an unlikely culprit for her ""ab"" ache\- especially since she was clearly referring to her fat roll\), healthy diets reduce fat and how weight lifting ""works"" to strengthen muscle, lactic acid, blah blah blah.  I tried to keep it as simple and short as possible while trying not to discourage her, but encourage her to keep up the good work.

The look on her face was as if I were explaining I saw aliens land in my yard last night.  A bit of wonder.  A bit of disbelief, and a whole lotta not understanding any of it.

She smiled nicely and said, ""Thanks!  I feel like I did my body some good and I want to keep going!""

Whew!  I don't know what she thinks she grasped but I'm going to keep a good eye on her at the gym to make sure she doesn't hurt herself on her journey to keep going.",Is this my abs?
fatpeoplestories,"Hello FPS!  I’m in the middle of moving (which is why I haven’t updated AttilaTheHam) but I had to stop to share this with you.  I’m on mobile so I apologize for any formatting issues.

Be:
Castle - 26 years old and just moved across the country.  Avid hiker, sometimes runner.  Looking for a dog to go on adventures with.  5’9 and 140 lbs.
Rex - Cute goldendoodle pup.  About 2 years old and maybe 60 lbs.

Don’t be:
AdoptionHam - 350 or so lbs (she was sitting down at a table) of power tripping ham.  Dog rescue volunteer who chooses who’s applications are approved and whose go in the trash.

So I go to this dog adoption clinic.  I’ve got my eye on one dog but end up totally falling for another dog, Rex.  I spend 2 hours playing with him and talking to his foster mom.  I’ve already got the preapplication paperwork in for the rescue (although I have to be approved for an individual dog) so I head up to the woman at the desk and say I’d like to submit a formal application for Rex.

AdoptionHam slides her chair back with a ear splitting screech and turns to me.  She takes my application in a fleshy paw.  After a minute of silence she takes a sip of her diet (tee hee) coke and narrows her eyes.  She jabs a sausage at my application.

“It says here that you’re “moderately active.” she growls.  “You really need to be able to keep up with a dogs energy needs.”

I plaster my best “people pleaser” smile on my face.  “I expand on that in one of the later boxes.”  I show her the place in the application and explain how I run almost daily and all the hiking I do in my free time.

AdoptionHam sighs and reached for her chips.  “You really need to be more than “moderately active” to handle a dog like Rex.  I fostered him for a while and even I had trouble keeping up with him.  I’ll put your application in but I don’t feel like I can approve adoption on the spot.  You should really think more about whether your ready for a dog first though.  I’ve had a lot of dogs so I can tell you it takes a lot to keep up with them.”

“I can give you a more detailed description of my schedule and activity level” I said desperately.

AdoptionHam waved her hand at me.  “That’s alright dear.  We’ll get in contact within the week”
As I turned to go she asked if I could hand her another bag of chips.  They were in a box in the other side of her desk, far closer to her than to me.
Being the wimp I am, I got them for her.

fatpeoplestories,"Obligatory long time lurker, first time poster disclaimer. I hope this fits the subreddit. Not your typical food\-stealing, CondishunsTM FPS, but something surrounding weight and food from a fat person that grinds my gears still.

BE: Me, Rex: 19, female, 5'4, 140lbs \(recently dropped 20 pounds\), recently been engaging in some less than healthy behaviors surrounding food.

Maybe be: Slinky: 17, male, best friend of Rex, boyfriend of Hamm. Struggles with bulimia. Not a very important in this story.

DON'T be: Hamm, 17, girlfriend of Slinky, 5'5 and I'd say around 220 lbs?

Now, I don't really judge others eating habits or weight too harshly because I'd feel hypocritical. But I do judge how people treat loved ones struggling with eating disorders, body dysmorphia, and the illnesses in general. And Hamm, despite being in a long term relationship with Slinky, really doesn't get a single thing about it.

A few weeks ago, she started complaining on her Snapchat story about Instagram accounts with large followings claiming to be body positive, yet also posting pictures of their fitness or body goals. Hamm claimed that this kind of behavior, glorifying smaller sized bodies, is what leads to eating disorders. She went on and on, just squealing about how hypocritical and insincere these accounts are for daring to want to look a certain way while telling others that they should have self\-love. She said that these people are the causes of eating disorders.

From my experience and every other person struggling with an eating disorder that results in weight loss that I've ever been in contact with, what she claims simply isn't true.

The thing is though... Hamm doesn't have an eating disorder. I can say this with absolute certainty because on numerous occasions, Slinky has confided in me about how dismissive Hamm is about his body dysmorphia and bulimia. She cannot even slightly grasp how he sees himself without believing this is somehow about herself and her weight.

Eating disorders are largely about control more than anything else \(at least, restrictive ones\). It takes form in weight loss, yes, but there is almost always a deeper root than just a person who wants to lose a bit of weight. People struggling with these behaviors don't just hate their bodies; they hate themselves. Posts about body goals can certainly be triggering to a person who already has or is developing an eating disorder. However, they themselves are not the cause.

Also, the thing is... Hamm is a complete hypocrite. Of all the things she shunned in her rant. To my knowledge, she isn't trying to be thin, but she does want to be thinner. She is constantly posting body checks both on Instagram and Snapchat of the weight she has \(supposedly\) loss. She talks about her experience on Weight Watchers. The only difference is that she doesn't have a huge following on Instagram following like the accounts she ranted about, but all of these things still have a decent potential to trigger any followers she has with an eating disorder. I can say for certain that I'm not usually at my best after seeing these. Not her fault, of course, but it's still so aggravating on how much of a hypocrite she is.

I have plenty of rants about her in so many different ways, but this is all for now. I, of course, didn't confront her about this because I figured it would just end up being a fight between all three of us, and also I lack a spine.",Moon doesn't understand eating disorders

fatpeoplestories,"A few weeks ago, my cousin got married and had a destination wedding. Since I was the maid-of-honour, my aunt &amp; uncle generously offered to cover all my expenses at the destination. 

Anyway, the wedding was a bit of a disaster with the wedding planner messing everything up (or deliberately adding fraudulent charges), so my aunt &amp; uncle had to go through every single charge to make sure they were valid. They found an extra charge of $551.83 for food, charged to my room over a period of 3 days. There was $363.35 charged in ONE DAY. 

Now, food was provided 3x/day buffet style for this wedding, with plenty of snacks served in between (all buffet style too, except once). Basically, there were food served buffet style 4-5x/day. The only time you'd ever need to order in-room dining or dine alone in one of the restaurants is if you missed any of the events...which happened quite a bit since there was free flow booze so there were tons of hungover people every day.

BUT, since I was maid-of-honour, my aunt knew I was at every event. I only missed 1 event on the night I landed, because I was still recovering from the flu, and that was it. All I ordered from in-room dining was a lemon-ginger juice and there was no way that cost anywhere close to $100 unless they blended in unicorn piss into it.

They were arguing with the hotel over the charge, and demanding to know which guest put the charge on my room. 

My sister finally confessed. She charged the food to my room.

As a family member, she was at every event too. The $551.83 is basically snacks in between 5 meals. 5 buffet style meals. How the fucking fuck do you eat $551.83 worth of snacks in 3 days? 

This is even though she already had [2 bariatric surgeries](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/5xsb43/my_sister_claims_she_got_gastric_surgery_to/) and is so fucking large, she can [no longer wipe her ass and needs to use a ~~tower~~ towel to floss](https://imgur.com/a/PVfyW). I have no idea how she's alive. 


**EDIT:** Fixed a typo &amp; just wanted to add that there were after party snacks too. So 6 meals/day. I was too sick for the after party on the 1st day and too busy babysitting drunk people on the 2nd day, so I don't know if my sister went for the after party though. 

My aunt just told me my sister is claiming she signed all those food on behalf of other people. I personally think that's a lie, and I also strongly suspect I'm not the only one she did this to. It was just easy to catch with me because I was running around at every event, and my husband, being the world's best husband, pretty much ended up as a bonus dude-of-honour running errands for the bride &amp; groom too, so there was no way we had time to go off and eat $550 worth of food on our own.

Even the other managers chime in but not the hamager she literally only has her deadend job to look forward to its kinda sad. She's also a complete hawk bitch when it comes to our jobs if anyone takes an unscheduled break or goes on a lunch for a couple mins extra she completely rips them apart and yells at them for losing the company money. I once saw her yell at my coworker for slouching in his chair for a couple mins cause his back hurt. LOL what the hell does that have to do with anything. 

Anyways once we were talking about working out and my friend was describing the difference between bulking and cutting and how watching your diet is extremely important. Sure enough the hamager waddles on over and starts talking to us about how she's a vegan. Everyones jaws dropped. I always thought vegans were the upper echelon of fitness nuts, and that being vegan takes an immense amount of discipline. I know a couple vegans and vegetarians that are in the gym 5 days a week and they watch their macros they are all shrinkwraps with defined 6 packs and definitely not 300 pounds. Plus they never brag about their eating habits. 

Hamager though comes on over and brags about how she avoids meat &amp; cheese and cant eat at restaurants anymore, apparently she's been a vegan for 5-6 years now. She preaches about how meat is unhealthy and its not prepared in the most humane way. She also tells all of us to go vegan for the sake of our health. lmaoooo. This fat turd ham is telling us to make a lifestyle change for the sake of our health omg i lost it. After she saw us  talking about dieting and working out one time, she now waddles over just tell us about what being vegan is like. She even tells us vegan recipes to try and talks about her favorite almond milk ice cream. I'm smart enough to know that vegans are the cleanest eaters and that their diet almost has no unhealthy fat. I seriously think her definition of vegan is chocolate chip cookies &amp; diet coke &amp; Cool Ranch Doritos. 

I just can't stand this fat turd whale hamager acting like she is the healthiest person in the world idk if shes delusional or just that dumb to think we think she is vegan or healthy I think she might be lying to deal with her own eating disorders. It's like if a marine went to war and lost his friends and lost a arm and had to make real sacrifices to serve his country, compared to the guy who wears a marine outfit and then goes around getting free shit and telling everyone to respect him. 

How can this fat humongous whale justify being vegan when's shes a fat turd that's made no sacrifices or even tried to achieve a healthy ideal? Thoughts? ","HAMAGER IS ""HEALTHY"" &amp; SHE WANTS YOU TO KNOW"
fatpeoplestories,"Growing up, my mom was super skinny. No matter what she ate, she never gained weight. I was normal sized but she constantly made fun of me. And when we passed a truly fat person in public? She would mock them mercilessly in the loudest of voices, preening herself all the while. 

She's getting older now and guess what...her metabolism has slowed down. Riiiiiight down. Every time that I see her, she's two sizes larger. It's very concerning. So concerning that I feel obliged to point it out every time we talk, remark upon it loudly in public, and discuss it in graphic detail with every single person that she meets. 

Ah, life's small pleasures.",Ham Karma
fatpeoplestories,"I'm always writing stuff on here about how people comment to me on a daily basis about how tall and skinny I am.  Sometimes it's a nice compliment.  Most times women make it sound more like bullying the skinny chick.  It's created quite an impression on me and I've learned to expect to have my feelings get stung. 

On St. Patrick's Day, I was with a large group at a bar with a billion other people.  It was elbow\-to\-elbow crowded.  People were bumping into each other, waiting in lines, and even though very drunk, there was always an apology.

I was standing still, talking with my sister, and kept getting sort of shoved from behind.  Not just the common bumping into you with an apology that had been happening.  Like, set me off balance.  Clearly, the group behind me was demanding more space.  I thought it was rude.  There was no space.  We had equal amounts of no space.

I glanced a side\-eye over my shoulder and saw a 5 foot tall 250\+ pound woman about my age \(48\), standing with her back to me.

Immediately, I thought this woman was shoving her fat ass directed at me because I'm a skinny, easy target for her to get the double amount of space her body required to stand there.

Whatever, I'm at a bar, having fun and I'll just stand my ground and she can realize I've nowhere to move over to and fuck it \- I was there first. I'll ignore it.

I would say she probably hit me 10 times in 20 minutes and I came to my breaking point.  I turned around, planning to say, ""Hey, could you please be aware that I'm right behind you and you keep nearly knocking me over?""

Ah....No.  Because when I turned around I saw she was wearing a back pack.  The back pack was hitting me, not her person hitting me.  She wasn't aware.

Then I thought, ""I'm the ass hole in the situation.  I assumed because she was fat that she was space\-bullying the skinny girl.""

So instead I said to her, ""I think your back pack is cute, but ...""  She looked, recognized her pack was hitting me and stepped a tiny step away from me, rolled her eyes and turned around saying, ""Whatever.""

Hmpf.  I guess she recognized she was the ass hole.",Space bullying in a crowded bar.
fatpeoplestories,"This is an old story.  Back in high school, my brother would always have his friends over especially in the summer because he was trying to be the cool kid and my parents were usually not home in the summer evenings.  There was this one girl who was obese.  I'm around 5'6 and 160lbs.  She was taller and wider than me by a few inches and probably around 220lbs.  She was nice person, but she always did one thing that always bother me.  Whenever she sees food, she ALWAYS has to try some.

I was in the kitchen making my own dinner and she sees me and casually says ""Ooh, can I try some?""  I let her try some.  Fine.  Being hospitable I give her a portion of my food.  I feel super stingy if I give her like 1 scoop, but there goes 1/2 my dinner.  If it was just one time, that's fine.  But it wasn't just one time.  This happened quite a few times and I never get anything in return besides a ""thanks.""  A few times they would bring their own food and she was still ask to try whatever it is I'm eating.  And they never shared their food with me.


One time my aunt came over and surprised me with food from her restaurant that I always loved.  It was nice and hot and I was excited that I didn't need to make dinner.  Fat friend sees it and asks to try some.  I feel bad saying no, so I ended up only eating a small portion while she took nearly all my food and gave some to her friends.


My asshole brother doesn't care that she's taking advantage of me.  He just wants to be Mr. cool. to impress his friends.


This didn't happen frequent enough for me to get super upset, but I had a ""You gotta be f*cking kidding"" moment when this happened:
My grandma comes by to drop off some medicinal soup for my parents.  Again, the fat friend asks if she can have some knowing full well that's for my PARENTS and it's MEDICINAL.  I was shocked that she wanted to some medicine.  This time I said no and that it was for my parents.  She said ""oh okay"" and finally stopped asking for food.  Like it said she was nice so she didn't give me any crap for refusing her, but I was always surprised at how food could make heavy friends overextend their welcome.

I don't mind sharing food with people if I have extra, but come on, learn to behave like a proper guest.

Edit:  I forgot to mention after experiences like and getting out on my own I learned to say ""no"" pretty easily.",Obese friend wants to try everything she sees
fatpeoplestories,"Hi FPS, Hyde here. At long last I bring you the final, sugar encrusted dessert course of the Evelyn Hamenez feast. First, I have a few things to say.

1.	 I’ve had several demands for updates on Salad Dressing Ham so I’ll just tell ya’ll right now: she vanished. Seriously. After the last story/sighting, there was a brief uproar when she was caught cheating at a campus-wide walking challenge, but after that, Jim and Patricia went 100% radio silent and Salad Dressing Ham never appeared again. I recently checked to see if the company still had a location here, and they are listed, but I searched any full names I knew (Jim’s, SDH’s, Patricia’s) at the electronic directory and none came up. It must be concluded, then, that SDH ate everybody and then finally popped and died. I did think there was finally a sign of her when I walked out of my building and saw a trail of mini muffins leading towards the garage once, but no dice. (I’m not kidding – there was actually a trail of mini muffins.)

2.	To the one person who was apparently convinced of my demise: I did not die of a spider bite. Some of you know via my post history that some bad stuff happened and life has been upside down since, and a great many thanks to those who were so kind and supportive. Life is still shitty but it will get better.

3.	After this post, I’m abandoning this account. I’ll still be lurking, but I won’t be posting as Hyde anymore. I'll answer any questions on this post I can, but no mas after that. :( Something something cutting ties to old stuff because therapeutic blah and nonsense. I won’t delete the username because it always drives me crazy when I can’t find stories by usernames that have been deleted. I love ya’ll, I’ll be around, but I won’t be Hyde. 

And now, what you’ve all been waiting for; a year and a half later, I present to you, the final stories of a Ham named Evelyn. Most of the stories I have left are probably more badpeoplestory than fatpeoplestory, but I promised ya'll a finale.

**Bill of Fare**

&gt;be me, Little Hyde, accidental destroyer of fine things, probable Jedi

&gt;be Mrs. Church, excellent fourth grade teacher

&gt;be Tommy, Hyde’s supplementary memory bank and lightsaber sparring partner

&gt;welcome guest contributor, Tommy’s dad

&gt;don’t be Grace, first bully, then victim

&gt;don’t be Evelyn, because Jesus will not love you and other bad stuff

Tommy thought I ought to put in that this was also the year that Evelyn told everyone that she was pregnant with Mikey’s baby, which apparently was a huge deal. I have no recollection of this but according to Tommy’s mom, “It was extremely inappropriate and a lot of families threatened to withdraw from the school if that kind of behavior was excused. Mike could have gotten expelled.”

Anyway. Onwards.

**The Nativity Incident**

Mrs. Church held a yearly Christmas party for her students in her home. She gave us all a very stern speech about being respectful of people’s homes, and asked that we please be careful with her possessions.

The party was wonderful. There was a beautiful Christmas tree with handmade spun sugar ornaments. We made Christmas oranges and Christmas cards, played in the backyard, and had a treasure map to a chest full of Christmas candy and small gifts, one for each of us. 

Evelyn was reprimanded for forcefully puncturing other classmates’ oranges with her thumbs. There were an abundance of sweet treats on the counter. Evelyn apparently decided to work her way through each platter, systematically decimating the cookies, the rice krispy treats, and the donut holes. Many of us were very disappointed we did not get any, because we were busy playing. At some point she became violently sick and threw up everything, but nobody felt pity.

At one point in the day, I went in to Mrs. Church’s living room. She had a beautiful porcelain Nativity set on the dining room table. It was so pretty, I thought I’d look closer. Somehow I knocked Mary over, and her little hand broke right off. 

Few times in my life have I felt such horror. I was at a lovely party my wonderful teacher had been so kind to throw for us, and she had cautioned us so sternly to be respectful of her home, and I’d just broken a beautiful possession – on a *Nativity*, no less! I carefully put Mary back, put the broken hand beside her, and ran to the restroom. 

I stayed hidden there for what seemed like hours, in agony. I could say nothing and pretend it never happened, but then someone else might be blamed. I had to confess – it would eat me alive if I didn’t confess! One of the boys banged on the door and yelled at me to hurry up, so I came out and hurried to find Mrs. Church before I could talk myself out of it.

Mrs. Church listened to my tearful confession very quietly. I told her that I was very, very sorry, I hadn’t meant to break Mary, and I was sure my Mom had a similar Nativity, could I please ask if we could trade so Mrs. Church could have an unbroken Nativity set? Mrs. Church told me we could talk about it later, thank me very much for telling her what happened, and please go play and enjoy the party. 

I felt better for telling the truth, but utterly sick that I’d done the wrong. Worse still – Evelyn had overheard me confess, and took the opportunity to gloat.

&gt;You broke Mrs. Church’s Mary? You are in sooo much trouble. Did you see how mad she was? You’ll get expelled for sure.

I was devastated. Now not only Mrs. Church hated me, but my parents would be *so* disappointed. The most overwhelming feeling of failure settled on my scrawny fourth grader self.
 
Suddenly, there was a theatrical gasp. Everyone turned to see Evelyn pointing dramatically at a small pile of crushed ornaments beneath the tree. 

&gt;Little Hyde, how *could* you? After breaking the Mary?!

I was frozen in shock, but before I could say anything, Kelsey (who did not, and does not, like me) came to my rescue.

&gt;Oh, shut up, Evelyn! Little Hyde didn’t break those ornaments, YOU did when you thought you could *eat* them!

The room burst into laughter. Evelyn turned red.

&gt;SHE SAID THEY WERE MADE OF SUGAR, YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO EAT SUGAR!

Mrs. Church gave her two detentions; one for attempting to frame me, and one for ~~trying to eat her ornaments~~ being disrespectful of others property. 

I was not punished for breaking Mary’s hand, but was told that my honesty was appreciated and that some superglue patched Mary up good as new. 

**The Trip to Sacramento**

These events are pulled purely from memory, because I have no journaled record of the trip that I can find. Fourth grade curriculum centered on California history, and culminated in a trip to the state capitol. It was on this trip that Tommy and I engaged in the most epic lightsaber battle ever fought, right in the streets of Old Town Sacramento. But you’re not here for lightsabers, you’re here for Evelyn, so let me tell you about as many shenanigans as I and Tommy can remember.

1.	We went to an aquarium. Evelyn tried to steal a starfish. She also tried to seduce one of the aquarium tour guides (with wildly inappropriate innuendo) who was so intensely uncomfortable he excused himself and someone else took over. (The “seduction” was a bit contributed by Tommy’s dad, who was on this trip with us. Tommy and I have no recollection of this.)

2.	We ate at the Old Spaghetti Factory and had a “family style” dinner. Evelyn ate three family sized bowls of pasta by herself and cried when the adults told her she needed to share. “I specifically remember this because she had to have all the ‘Mexico colors’ – red (marinara), white (alfredo), and green (pesto) pasta.” –Tommy

3.	Evelyn had to stay behind from activities one day with a chaperone because she was caught looking in one of the boys windows. 

4.	Evelyn snuck back out to go into the pool when we’d been told to get out because there was a thunderstorm nearby. 

5.	Evelyn packed almost nothing but snacks, had nothing extra to wear, and was spoken to because the shirt she wore every day smelled so bad it made your eyes water. “It definitely was not only the shirt that smelled.” -Tommy

6.	We got to hold a gold bar at the state bank. Evelyn tried to walk/sneak away with it and then shouted discrimination because “they assumed I was trying to steal it because I’m Mexican.”

7.	When we panned for gold, we got to keep little vials of any gold we collected. Evelyn stole several before being caught and angrily told Mrs. Church that it was just another form of discrimination to keep her poor. “At some point we went to a store that sold fool’s gold and she actually gave up buying candy to buy a whole bunch, saying she couldn’t believe people were such suckers and now she’ll be as rich as Vargas. She was furious when someone told her it was fake.”-Tommy 

8.	“Evelyn ate so much clam chowder on Pier 39 she made herself sick and puked all over me on the ferry to Alcatraz.”-Tommy 

9.	On Alcatraz, Evelyn shut the door behind Jaqueline and Alana when they went into “The Hole” (solitary) and held it shut while they panicked. “One of the girls had a full blown panic attack and nearly had to go to the hospital that day.” –Tommy’s dad

10.	Evelyn purposefully misdirected one of our classmates (we think it was Jonathan) so he would get separated and lost from the group when we visited Coit Tower, which meant we were stuck there for 45 minutes while the adults frantically searched for him. When confronted, Evelyn cried and said she was being bullied. “The police were nearly called. It was really, really bad.” –Tommy’s dad

11.	“Evelyn stole a chaperone's wallet and claimed she thought it was her dad's. Her dad didn't come on the trip.”-Tommy 

And last, but not least…

**The Choir Incident**

In fourth grade you were allowed to audition for choir. A few of us tried out, and were accepted. Evelyn made fun of us for being “overachievers” until a mean girl in a higher grade, named Grace, joined up. Evelyn was *obsessed* with Grace. Evelyn immediately auditioned and was furious when she was told she didn’t make the cut. (She could not carry a tune, at *all*, and refused to audition with a prescribed piece – she “freestyled”, a la Christina Aguilera-esque warbles. The result was hysterically horrendous.) A few angry phone calls from her parents later, she was part of the choir.
	
This was to everyone’s detriment, but mostly Grace’s. I never got along with Grace – she was a bitch. And if she’d been less of a bitch I might have felt bad seeing the weirdness Evelyn subjected her to. What we had to put up with as a choir was standard Evelyn: constant talking, constant wrappers crinkling, terrible singing, crumbs and spit everywhere, and the *smell*. Grace, on the other hand, graduated to the next circle of Evelyn hell. 

Before we worry about Grace, let’s talk about Evelyn’s attitude once she was actually in choir. Holy. Shit. She was Florence Foster Jenkins 2.0, the pop album. It was awful. It was laughable. But Evelyn was adamant that she was the best thing to ever happen to the choir, except for Grace. Every single practice, she’d demand that the solos given to Grace (actually a very accomplished singer) be duets for them to sing together. This request was repeatedly denied. She would sing along to the solos anyway, “vamping” to show her “talent”. She drove our choir director *crazy* - the poor woman actually started BRINGING SNACKS to shut Evelyn up. If she was eating, she wasn’t singing, right? It was a nightmare. 

Soon we were performing, and performing often. The director started giving her “supplementary solos” with a dead mic because she would not stop singing along to the solos. Off key. Out of tune. Any criticism was discrimination. Everyone started to just look forward to the end of choir season.

Simultaneous to our choral nightmare, Evelyn started to dress like Grace. We wore uniforms, but any girl who has ever gone to a school with a dress code knows the list of “modifications”. Grace’s skirt hems were *very* short. Suddenly, so were Evelyn’s. (*Hurk*) Grace wore a size small polo, which was tight even on a slim girl. Suddenly, Evelyn also wore a “small”. Grace wore headbands with hair bows. Grace wore her hair bobbed and side parted. Grace wore cutesy saddle shoes. Grace wore two pink beaded friendship bracelets and a cross necklace. Evelyn imitated all these things so closely it was unnerving. 

Grace was mean to everyone, but definitely made fun of Evelyn for her imitations. But Evelyn’s persistence began to wear on her. Grace began to complain that Evelyn showed up to her youth group. Evelyn showed up at her piano recital. Evelyn showed up at her soccer games. One of the best stories going around was that Evelyn had stalked Grace to the mall food court, fished her leftovers out of the trash, and eaten them. Grace went from rude and demeaning to wary and freaked out. 

Evelyn would bring Grace cookies. Cakes. Pies. Sweets. At this point everyone was so weirded out we wondered if she was doing stuff to the food before she gave it to Grace. Who randomly gives a school bully a pumpkin pie?! We (half) jokingly theorized that she was trying to fatten Grace up to eat her. 

But everyone agreed that the creepiest thing Evelyn did to Grace, was at the spring choral performance. Grace had been given a particularly difficult solo and she had been practicing constantly. We all had. We were ready. The whole school would be there, it was a really big deal.

Our choral uniforms were hideous, cobalt blue dresses with square panels and shoulder pads. Ugly as sin. Nobody looked nice in it, at all. In an effort to combat the ugly, Grace had told everyone she was getting her dress tailored so at least it fit nicely.  

The girls had one dressing room, in which there was a lot of noise and bustle and laughter. Everyone was helping everyone else pull up zippers and fix the stupid shoulder pads. Then there was a shocked gasp and some loud whispers, followed by a scream.

&gt;My *DRESS!*

Grace was staring at her backside in the mirror, furious. There was a huge swatch of fabric cut out of the skirt, straight up to the bodice. It was so wide that we couldn’t even pin it together and tell her to keep her back to the stage. It was just plain ruined.

&gt;WHO DID IT? WHO? I’ll kill you!

Our choir director heard the commotion and came running.

&gt;What is it? What’s happened?

&gt;SOMEONE CUT MY DRESS!

There were several shocked exclamations as they tried to figure out what to do. Grace burst into tears. 

Everyone was whispering to each other when a certain loud voice drowned us out.

&gt;Oh, *no*, her dress is ruined? Now she can’t sing the solo!

Dead. Silence. Evelyn looked around, smug, and repeated herself.

&gt;Now she can’t sing the solo!

Grace was white.

&gt;It was *you*.

Evelyn didn’t say anything, she just twirled her skirt. She seemed uncomfortable suddenly, like she had expected people to be relieved she was stepping in. 

&gt;You. Cut. My. SKIRT.

&gt;No I didn’t.

She was defensive now. Our director was stunned.

&gt;Evelyn, did you cut Grace’s skirt? Why would you do that? Just to sing the solo?

&gt;I DIDN’T cut her skirt. 

&gt;Then what happened?

&gt;I DIDN’T. Cut her skirt. But now we have to onstage and SHE CAN’T SING THE SOLO because her dress is screwed up. That means I have to, because nobody else is talented enough. But I didn’t do it!

The scene was interrupted by a triumphant cry.

&gt;You DID! The piece is here, in your bag!

Another girl had gone rifling through Evelyn’s bag and found scissors and the cut fabric. There were things all over the ground now.

Grace rushed across the room.

&gt;Those are all of my things! In her bag! They’re MY THINGS!

Items were flying around as she picked up each one to identify it.
 
&gt;You cut my dress! You stole my stuff! You copy everything about me! What the hell is wrong with you? – You… STOLE MY UNDERWEAR?

Between a disgusted thumb and forefinger, Grace was holding a pair of cutesy underwear that was stretched, misshapen, and *stiff* in… places. It was clear they’d been worn, and not by Grace.

Grace started sobbing. The director started pacing with her hands on her head. Another girl ran to get more adults, and suddenly we were ushered out and away. 

The choral performance did not happen. Other skits went on, the younger kids sang, the principal gave a speech, but we did not sing. 

I frankly have no idea what the repercussions were for Evelyn, and I likewise have no idea how Grace/her family/the school handled it. I probably knew at one time but I never wrote it down. Tommy doesn't know either except he saw Grace's family at his church instead of their old one from that point on. 

That, my friends, is the last of the tales of the horrendous beast known as Evelyn Hamenez. Thank you for reading, and I'm glad you've enjoyed them.

Tl;dr: It’s been a blast. I love ya’ll.  
","Evelyn Hamenez: The Bad, The Worse, and The Terrible"
fatpeoplestories,"My best friend has never been skinny, which is understandable because her portions are always twice what I have and she is convinced that 5 or more huge meals a day plus snacks is normal. I love her to bits, but she has always had an unhealthy relationship with food. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been overweight as well but I have self control and can manage to lose whatever I put on.

What’s really starting to get to me is how she feeds her animals. They are CONSTANTLY eating. She has two cats, one who is 5 and the other who is 1. The five year old has always been obese, like HUGE. The 1 year old was very tiny at first, but has slowly been gaining a lot of fat. The other day she sent me a picture of the 1 year old, and I mistook it for her obese 5 year old, and that’s when I knew there was a problem. She complains that she can’t afford good cat food and that’s why they’re overweight, but she can’t afford it because she goes through so damn much. She’s convinced that having set meals for them is abuse, and no cat should have zero control over what they eat.

She’s also one to comment on my body, and my fucking cats body too. If I’m at a healthy weight she’ll say “you’re too skinny, you looked way better before” and “are you even feeding your cat at all? She’s skin and bones, I feel so bad for her”. For the record, I’m not that skinny, and my cat is extremely healthy. I make sure of it. So when my overweight friend with obese animals tells me that, it just hurts inside. I would feed my cat before I would feed myself, there is no way I would let her go hungry. I feel like she’s just trying to validate her unhealthy behaviour by making me feel like I’m doing something wrong, when In fact she just has no self control.

TL;DR: ham friend is turning her cats into hams, and judging me for having a healthy lifestyle for both myself and my cat. 

Ok rant over haha. ","(RANT) It’s one thing to apply fat logic to yourself, but it’s abuse to apply it to your pets."
fatpeoplestories,"This is the story of Thomas (Not his real name) and his descent into whalehood. If you are expecting stuff like ""Muh condishuns"" or any entitled fatlogic statements then Im afraid you wont find it here. Sorry. 

Thomas was many things, but first and foremost he was lazy. However, he was the kind of person that was allowed to be lazy - Even though he only ever did the bare minimum of what was required during work/school, he always finished on schedule and did was he was supposed to do. Not the kind of person Id rely on in a pinch, but hey - as long as he gets shit done, nobody cared. 

Thomas is short, a heavy smoker at the prime age of 22 (back then) and some might call him chubby. I for one dont like those euphemisms so yeah - Hes always been fat. I estimated him to be around 5,5"" and at least 240 pounds, or 1,65 meters and 110kg.

Eventually Thomas called in sick several times a month, then each week and eventually he was gone more often than he was at work/school. Nobody really knew why. He also met his soon to be wife around that time and they quickly married - And I do mean quickly. They have been dating for less than a month, planned the wedding only a few months later and pulled through with it. I warned him that this isnt a good idea, but he was desperate and ultimatley it was none of my business.

He got worse and worse, gained more weight and smelled like an entire malboro factory each time he returned from his smoking break. He developed unhealthy habits like driving everywhere instead of walking because his feet hurt. By this time he probably weight around 250 pounds so I can definitly see that walking at this point would be uncomfortable. What should have been a red flag was brushed of as being overworked and tired and he continued to eat trash and move very little. Judging from the bags under his eyes it was appearant that he didnt get too much sleep either, co-workers and teachers suspected a part time job because he couldnt afford the new lifestyle of the married life, or other issues. Often times he would react very slowly and sluggish, to a point where it would have been comical if it werent so concerning.

I didnt realize just how bad it was until he went to the hospital for 2 months. Nobody knows why exactly, just that it was bad. When he returned I could barely recognize him. You often read about ""bloated"" fat people that look like deformed balloon animals on this sub and thats really the only way I can describe it. He looked like a balloon. Again, pure estimate but he probably clocked in at around 400 pounds. Keep in mind that he was only 5""5 so he went from obese to Snorlax levels of proportions. I noticed that he was driving a new car and that he was missing his wedding ring, so I of course asked him what happened. He didnt fit in his old car anymore, so he had to get a new one. His fucking weddingring cut of his blood flow so he cant wear it anymore, his fingers are simply too fat.

I was getting curious just how it was possible to gain this much weight in such a short of time, especially in a goddamn hospital, where the patience of most nurses and docs is small, and the food rations smaller. At first he didnt want to talk about it but then blamed it on drug use. Now, I dont know anything about drugs. Im probably as straight edge as you can get, no alcohol, no cigs, no nothing. Not wanting to make an already uncomfortable situation even more unbearable I decided to stop pushing further. He said the drugs made him feel better and that his marriage is at the point of collapsing anyway. Because of his drug use his appetite grew to a new extreme and combined with the fact that he, you know, bought drugs, he was in so much debt that he was also in private insolvency. At age 22-23 mind you. Because of that, his appearance and everything else he fell into a downwards spiral of depression. Took more drugs, got fatter, lost more money, was unhappy, took more drugs. But he didnt had the power to stop, and I dont think he ever regained that power. Last time I saw him was a few days before he was sent to the hospital again and the last time I heard from him was that he was getting a divorce because his wife cheated on him. I doubt he will ever leave the downwards spiral.



And thats the story of Thomas. Little bit different than most of the stuff that you read on this sub but I wanted to share it regardless. Im pretty sure behind most of the fatlogic and entitlement hides a similiary ugly story - Most of the time Im more sad than I am disgusted whenever I meet those people.",My old classmate or: A different kind of fatpeoplestory.
fatpeoplestories,"Hello, longtime lurker and finally have something to post!

I'm gonna start off by saying that I'm not a super\-fit person. I just realized I was teetering on the edge from ham to hamplanet and decided I was going to finally start doing something about it. I basically just watched what I ate at first and when I started intermittent fasting the weight just fell off of me \(50lbs in five months!\), but I still need to lose an additional 60lbs to be at a healthy\-ish weight. I'm not starving myself or ""sickly"" by any means of the word and I've actually gotten a lot of compliments from various friends/acquaintences! My ex\-best friend, though, took it offense to the fact that I was doing the intermittent fasting in the first place and did everything she could to try to change my mind and stay in my old, gross, hammy ways.

We're both kinda tall \(I'm 6'0"" and was at 290ish lbs and she's 5'10""\) so when we used to be around the same weight and would share and borrow clothes and go out to eat together ALL THE TIME. Thinking back to how often we ate trash through the day actually grosses me out now. BUT when I started losing the weight she started getting snarkier and shitty to me for no reason. It started getting annoying when I would tell her it was too early/late in the day for me to eat and she would loudly cause a scene and yell at me that I was starving myself and needed nourishment no matter where we were or who we were with. It got so bad that she forced her boyfriend and a few friends to text and talk to me about my ""eating problem."" I, obviously, became livid and blocked her shortly after.

Suffice to say, I was not letting that shit fly and I cut her out of my life \(her accusing me of starving myself is only the tip of the fuck\-that\-noise iceberg\). Funnily enough, after I blocked her another friend that is aware of how bad ex\-friend was and sent me a string screenshots showing her posting bitter, vague statuses about me. My favorite one was ""You can fix fat, but bitch you CAN'T FIX UGLY."" Sounds about right! Though I prefer to have my ""ugly"" face to her a ugly personality.

Sorry if this was long but thank you for reading!","When I say I'm watching what I eat, I actually mean I'm ""starving myself,"" apparently."

————————-


This isn’t a story per se, but a small rant and collection of my little brother, who is slowly and definitely turning into a fat logic spitting unlikeable person.

I still live at my mom’s and visit my dad at most weekends. I am a part-time only child, hehe. 

It’s hard to start when it comes to Fortmoon. He’s doing bad at school, plays Fortnite for all day on his phone ( and gets really aggressive and generally emotional while doing so), doesn’t go out anymore and if he does, he spends most of his money on food. That kid. He’s just THAT kid.

His weight is really concerning. You can sense that he isn’t happy with himself, but it’s hard to talk about his weight problem with him.

He once insisted, that he has big bones, while BigLilSis called that BS. I chimed in and said, if you can’t wrap your fingers completely around your wrist, you’re having big bones. He happily exclaimed, that he can and than I said, “well than you have totally normal-sized bones.” He was just like “Oh” and ran off.

BigLilSis and FM always have bickering when it comes to weight. Whenever there is an argument, he’ll call her fat, to what she always replays “You weight as much as me and you’re even smaller”. He totally blocks off and laughs at her and continues to call her names (luckily she doesn’t give a fuck). 

When it comes to clothes, he is also in denial. He’ll always insist to buy clothes sized S or M, but complains that they’re too small. There isn’t a chance that he accepts a larger size (SuperMom somehow manages to smuggle some into his wardrobe though.)
That also resulted into him only wanting to wear sweatpants.

He started doing some pushups, because he wants to build muscles, so girls would like him. He does five. Goes to the mirror and starts flexing. BigLilSis and I start cackling and disappear into our room.

Honey tries to talk to him. FM calls him fat, “look at yourself”, ”Haha, go eat honey”,  “You probably swallowed a melon” and generally will shout and laugh at him. Honey will still tease him dadlike, but gets super much backlash. Also, Satan‘s sprout pretty much adapted this and also bullies Honey.

SuperMom really tries to restrict his constant food refilling. She says when it‘s enough and he should get some fruit instead of chips or grilled cheese sandwich. Sometimes, he even listens and complains. But most times, he will sneak into the kitchen when she’s asleep.
She says, that she hopes that he’ll just grow out of his weight, like I and my sister did. The difference is, my sister and I were quite aware of our unhealthy eating behaviors and we were already really tall when we were his age. Also we weren’t THAT much overweight, she was even less than me.! Lowkey offended.
Honey also says, that he will probably be skinnier than all of us, since he will grow. Why don’t they consider his eating habits won’t change and he’ll eventually get round again?

This kid started sprouting fatlogic and idk where he got that from. I was sitting and chilling myself in the living room, when he suddenly plopped himself besides me and started talking about, how he’s feeling dizzy and he thinks his sugars are low.

[what](https://i.gifer.com/HLa.gif)

„I don’t know why else I am feeling like this“
„I just think you have eh... Low stamina?“ (I dont want to be an asshole sister)

Fortmoon used to play soccer/football. SmolBro thought that was cool and also started playing football ( we don’t even have the American one). Eventually, FM got lazy and slowly, but surely stopped going. SmolBro is generally much outside and goes to trainings, games and tournaments a lot. He eats much, but stays skinny. FM calls him anorexic, wrangles around with him until he’s crying and brags about how much stronger he is. 

SmolBro will be outside for the whole noon. SuperMom never know when exactly he will be back and decides to make a giant pot of noodles and everyone can add sides by themselves. Everyone gets their plate, plenty of noodles left over, yay. Satan’s sprout insist on a second plate, but wants to do that alone. Shovels some noodles onto her plate, she doesn’t eat much anyway.  An hour later; SuperMom, Honey and I Netflix and Chill in the living room, BigLilSis and Satan‘s sprout are cuddling in our room, FM probably in his room. SmolBro comes home, hungry, asks SuperMom if she made food. Goes straight to the kitchen. Screams „YOU JUST LEFT ME SO LITTLE?“, starts crying, poor boy is really hungry, SuperMom and Honey go into the kitchen and there are only a few noodles left. SuperMom asks Honey, but he was with us the whole time. The other two sisters also didn’t come out of our room, which only leaves one ...
„Ugh why are crying again?“
„You ate all noodles!“
„N-No. Besides, if you wouldn’t go outside all the time, you wouldn’t have missed dinner. Don’t blame it on other people.“
SuperMom sets a new pot of noodles. SmolBro gets some. Guess who does too? 

FM really adores me. Idk why, but I am some kind of role model for him. I love him, but since he started playing Fortnite on his phone I keep my distance. I play enough only games, I don’t need a raging kid right beside me. Besides, he doesn’t talk about anything else anymore.
He still copies me a lot. I don’t mind. But what does he also copy? Right, my food. Who has unhealthy eating habits, that resolves into excessive binge sessions? Ding Ding Ding, me. ( I am not proud.)
I am mostly in the kitchen while binging. He comes in:
„What are you eating“
„Oh, this and that.“
He starts making this and that.
I am an atrocious role model.

That’s kinda it for now. I am sorry that it’s so unorganized. Word vomit. I needed to get this out of my system, you know, wordvomit. I really, really do love my brother, but he starts turning into someone (especially personalityvise), I can’t stand.
What is worse, he just doesn’t listen. Just, only to me. But he also starts ignoring me and I really don’t want to hurt his feelings too much. He’s already feeling so uncomfortable at many occasions(you can see it in his face) and all his assholeity is probably some kind of self protection, but it is just so hard and exhausting to interact with him. 
I really hope we can change him for the better. Not for us, but mostly himself. 

Sorry for spelling mistakes.
",My Minimoon-brother
fatpeoplestories,"Throwaway bc my main account is very active on some subreddits that would most most likely ban me for even looking at this sub :'-)

So on most forms of social media, I follow, and am followed by, a girl who went to my college for 3/4 of a semester. We'll call her Hamthro. Hamthro was in my anthropology class, and she was large. This didn't bother me. What DID bother me was that Hamthro would make every. single. class discussion into a debate on weight. Talking about commodity fetishism in clothing brands? I brought up Nike, she raised her hand to tell the class that Nike doesn't make clothes for fat people because they hate them. Okay. Hamthro. 

So she leaves, and we never really interact again, aside from the occasional like of a selfie, or me rolling my eyes at her bullshit tales of woe on Facebook about being fat shamed 24/7. 

And then I post the offending photograph that sparks the title. 

So, important to the story--I'm a lil amateur bodybuilder &amp; personal trainer. I LIVE at the gym. I also macro track 6 days of the week, and 1 day I don't track at all. 

So myself, my best friend and boyfriend decide to go to this customizable burger joint. I get a gigantic vegan burger with all of the toppings, as well as orders of fries, onion rings, potato skins, and dessert for the table. My friend takes a cute picture of me holding my burger, surrounded by all of the food, and I caption it ""i clearly have a healthy appetite."" It gets loads of comments from friends like ""okay but how are you still hot?"" and ""can you even fit that much food in your body?"" Again, I do NOT eat like this every day, or even every week! It's a treat. 

The next day, I wake up and scroll through instagram, where I see she has screenshot her own Facebook post and posted it. 

""Skinny girls can talk about eating 'SOOO much food' and consume like two thousand calories in one sitting, and it's fucking 'adorable!! And 'omg you're so cool.' But if a fat girl adds whipped cream on her coffee she's a gross disgusting ugly blob person. Fucking wooow. PSA to all the skinny girls who post pictures of them eating like shit bc of their fast metabolisms--you're what's wrong with the world. Sincerely, a fat bitch with an ACTUAL appetite."" 

I was ROLLING. I must have sent it to fifteen people... and she blocked me right after I liked it. 

It's never ever my intention to make people feel bad about their bodies. I'm sorry if t upset her honestly. But come on! Also I hate when people cite my metabolism as reason for my body. There's a reason I have to macro track so much and so strictly. I work really hard to look like I do. It's not my fault you don't. ",Apparently *I* am what's wrong with the world.
fatpeoplestories,"Unlike many posts here, this one is about me. Also, I'm from mobile, so excuse any mistakes. I'm  6ft4 tall guy that used to be an athlete and after getting a girlfriend went from 210lb (rippedish) to 330lb. (Jupiter status). Of course I adopted the fat logic and used excuse after excuse to get exponentially bigger. 

After hitting the 330lb Mark I decided I had to make something and have been making an effort to thin up. I'm down to 250lb and still have a long way to go but I'm trying to make it and as I have posted here before you guys have been huge motivators.

Yesterday I went to ride a bicycle with my girlfriend alongside the beach. Things went smoothly and I actually didn't even feel like I was exercising. I was actually proud of myself, my girlfriend asked to take a break (135lb and 5ft5, she's thin, very thin. Just not very fit.) and I wasn't even sweating. We biked for 6km and went home.

I went to shower and because I'm so big, the bicycle seat burned the place where my butt meets my legs. Now I have rashes and they burned with soap. This makes me both ashamed and more motivated to keep losing weight. 

I know it's a pointless story, but thought I'd share a happy one to contrast with all the crap and mean planets you guys meet.

",Jupiter tries to ride the bycicle
fatpeoplestories,"Allow me to introduce my Brother-In-Law. 6-foot, 4 inches tall and 650+ lbs. It’s shocking that he’s reasonably mobile.  Believes you can eat anything you want as long as you exercise. I’ll call him BikeHam, for reasons revealed below.  

 Let me create the mental image for you. My brother-in-law at least recognizes the importance of getting some sort of exercise, so he’s come up with a way to get it in.  Walking around the block, you say? I’m afraid not. Walking doesn’t have the built-in excuses of his elegant solution. 

BikeHam purchased an exercise bike and removed the seat since it is too small to support him. Instead, he will sit on the couch and tip the bike backwards toward him so that his feet can reach the pedals. Seems like a decent idea until you realize that this causes the bike to be pushed away from him as he pedals. He will then push the coffee table up to support the front end of the bike, and have his girlfriend sit on the table in order to keep the whole mess from moving. So the whole set-up has to involve a couch, partially-assembled bike, and a coffee table with his girlfriend on top. 

This all happens after midnight so he can play Call of Duty with kids in South Korea as he pedals. 

After pedaling at a leisurely pace for 5-10 minutes, he’ll stop and then consume some sort of high-protein snack for “recovery” as he continues playing his  game. What he considers “high protein” is debatable and is a story for another day. 

So this means he’ll only exercise between 2am and 3am, and only when his girlfriend will sit on the table, and even then only when he knows he has a high protein “recovery” meal ready to go...which she has to prepare. His Asian gamer pals also need to be online. If any part of this elaborate equation is missing, he’s not going to do it.

We founds a darling and risky sets of shorts. My husband 6ft 185lbs bought a medium, this man is not small his legs are all muscle and his tush is adorable. The medium was too large.

Growing up I would go trick or treating every Halloween. Usually with my little brother and some friends. I would always make my own costume because my parents wouldn't buy me one. I'd come home happy and excited, my mom would tell me I looked stupid, and then I'd go to bed. 

I would wake up in the morning to find most of my candy missing. 

I know it's not a huge deal, but wtf? Who literally steals candy from a baby? My mom would always scream at me if I complained, saying ""You're so greedy! I'm just keeping you from getting fat! I only took a couple of pieces!""

As I said before, if I ever ate what she thought was unhealthy or fat, I'd get called a fat pig. Never mind the fact that I was severely underweight and she actually was fat. She would punish me for gaining weight during by not buying me new clothes. I had the same clothes from ages 6-18 and if I outgrew them I was ""getting fat."" When I was 11 or 12, she bought me my first couple of bras. She never bought me any more, and she took the money I earned. Maybe this is TMI, but I was a teenager with 30D cups who was forced to wear 30A cups. When I complained about this I was called a fat ugly slut. Ironically, if I ever tried exercising she'd make fun of me, like ""You're so lazy! Why bother! You won't ever change! No matter what you do you'll be ugly and no one will ever love you!"" 

And then she'd make fun of me for being insecure...",More fat mom ranting

Anyway, one semester in my junior year, she was placed in our suite. We all tried to be nice, but she was just really huge and pretty strange, and there was one guy on campus to compare size wise. She was that obese and didn't go to parties, went home every weekend or almost every weekend etc.

The story is this. When she would crap, it was the worst smell you've ever experienced--choke and gag like three rotten dead bodies were there--terrible...the Hiroshima of shits. We'd come back after lunch or something and gag, nearly puke, open all windows, and leave if we could. I know she knew it was a horrible stench, and that's why she'd do it when no one else was there.

fatpeoplestories,"My mom isn't horribly fat, but she is pretty overweight. One thing I find ridiculous is when people who obviously can't control their diet try to lecture others about it. 

My mom constantly complains to me about eating ""junky food"", as she would say in her broken english. I eat sweets every day and often junk food. I eat whatever I want, but manage to keep myself within my BMI for a number of reasons which just come natural to me. I think the main reason is that I just don't go crazy with food in general, unlike her. When I see the portions some people eat, I can never imagine them even fitting inside me, no matter how tasty the food is. My gruncle (who eats nothing but healthy) even said that I had developed a ""diet culture"" on my own that he admires.

My mom buys all the organic/bio/whatever food for herself, while the sweets and fast food are usually treats that I eat...

... That is, until night falls. I sometimes hear her rummaging around the kitchen at like 2 or 3 AM. Her most preyed victim is nutella. I've always eaten nutella for breakfast since I was little, never stopped loving it. However, I always eat it with bread. When I wake up in the morning, THE JAR IS ALMOST EMPTY. AND IT WAS BOUGHT YESTERDAY. She always leaves a perfect flat surface so it's obvious she used a spoon.  And when I say empty, she always leaves just as much so that I have enough to spread on one single slice of bread before it runs out. This annoys me because a) nutella is not very cheap to us in my country b) it's supposed to last at least a week and she consumes it in a single night and c) why is it so fucking difficult to eat it with BREAD?! You get a fuller stomach and use up less spread! I can't imagine a human body being able to consume an entire jar of nutella without drowning in your own diarrhea. But when I confront her about it (not just for the nutella, but also other food that disappears at lightning speed), she either acts like she's entitled to it or is passive about it and avoids the conflict.


The funny thing is, as mentioned, she tries to eat healthy, even exercises, but somehow, her cravings are so strong, that they nullify any healthy advances she has made. It's crazy.

Anyway, we shared a pop corn.  The rate he ate his popcorn was unbelievable.  I would grab a couple, munch delightfully and go back for another handful and every single time, his huge hand was already in there.

So I started to pay attention to his rate of eating.  Around ten rapid handfuls to my one.  For an hour.  Well, until it was all gone.

Also, I don't have a lot of sweet snacks in our home.  Every once in a while, I'll go for the tub of ice cream I bought a day or so before, and it will be gone.  Poof!  Like it never existed.

fatpeoplestories,"Hello, long time lurker, first time poster, blah blah blah….

This is the story of the worst person I have ever met and how she had to be forcibly removed from my apartment.

First, some background.  Consider this an appetizer if you will.

Characters:

Be Castle:  24 years old.  I have a job, a snake, and a pretty rad apartment.  5’ 7” and about 145 pounds.   I’m currently losing weight healthily through exercise and eating right.  Kind of a pushover

Don’t be Attila:  Also 24.  5’ 5” and maybe 215 pounds. Filled with fat logic and sells some stupid MLM product.  Has a baby, doesn’t know who the father is.  An invader, like her namesake.

Probably don’t be: Genghis Kahn, Attila’s baby.  He’s probably one and a half in this story?  I guess that means hes a toddler?

Don’t work for: BodyShit.  That’s what I’m calling the stupid pyramid scheme/bullshit/MLM thing Attila sells.

I had just graduated college and found myself a great job in a cheap city. After a few sketchy roommates I decided to take the plunge and rent an apartment by myself.  I found  a pretty great place for a decent price.  It had two bedrooms.  I slept in the smaller one and used the master bedroom as a computer/musical instrument/whatever room.  

Attila was my friend from middle school through college. She was always a little overweight and full of fat logic.  We fell apart when I was in college.  After college I had spent a few months in my hometown and had reached out to her.  She had a baby and seemed to have her life together.  We got coffee a few times and, while she was still full of fat logic and drama, I was glad we were friends again.  Then I moved across the country for work and figured I would never see her again.

Now…..for the main course:

I’m on Facebook one day when I get a message from Attila.

“Hi Castle!  Do you still live in \[city\]?”

I told her I did and that I was enjoying it.  I was not expecting her next message.

“That’s great!  I have a BodyShit convention there next month!  Do you think I could stay with you?”

I immediately started to backtrack.  I told her I’m kind of out of the city and it would be hard for her to get to and from the convention. After some hemming and hawing I eventually told her I just wasn't comfortable having a baby in my apartment.

“He’s not coming!  This is my vacation! Tee Hee!”  \(She literally typed tee hee\)

After some pestering I relented.  We had been really good friends and it was only going to be a few days…...right?

Two months later I’m picking Attila up from the airport.  I get to the baggage claim and am met with two surprises.   

1\)  The mountain of hot pink suitcases.

2\) Attila holding a screaming baby.

“Hi Castle!” Attilla waved me over.  “Boy that was a rough flight.  Khan here is so upset!”

“Yeahhhhhhh. I thought you were leaving him with your mom.”

“Ughhhhhhhhhhhhh”  Attila rolled her eyes.  “That bitch threw me out last week.”  She proceeded to tell me how her mother had kicked her and Kahn out with no warning.  It sounded really rough so I suggested dinner to take her mind off of it.  That perked Attila up and she even offered to treat me.

I suggested a great sushi place by my apartment but Attila turned it down because Kahn couldn't eat there.  She suggested the Hard Rock Cafe.  I protested because it was already pretty late and I didn’t want to drive all the way downtown but Attila insisted.  Since she was treating I figured, why not.

Getting her luggage into my Subaru was a nightmare but eventually we arrived one piece.  It was less than thirty seconds after we were seated that Attila ordered three huge greasy appetizers, a burger, a kids meal for Kahn, and two margaritas.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and a salad.

“Come on Castle!” declared Attila, “order a drinkkkk!  You’re being boring!”

“I have to drive us back.  Plus I have work in the morning.”

“You didn’t take this week off?” asked Attila, shocked. “I thought we were hanging out!”

“Don’t you have your convention?”

“Yeah but I’m going to skip half of it.  It’s pretty boring.  Hey! Don’t eat all the wings!” she \(I kid you not\) slapped my hand away from the “shared” plate.  I’m so hungry after the flight.  I need to keep my sugar up.  Besides,” she used a fry to gesture at my food, “you’re obviously on a diet anyways.”

I shrugged.

Attila sighed, “you skinny girls are sooo lucky.  We eat basically the same thing and you’re basically a model.  Too bad you have no ass though. Without mine I would have never gotten knocked up though.  It makes me irresistible!”

I shrugged again.  It was going to be a long week.

The check came and Attila made a huge spectacle of searching for her wallet.

“Ooops!” she said, “I guess I left it in your car!  You’re rich though so this won’t be a big deal for you.”

I rolled my eyes and pulled out my credit card.  I was not rich and did not like the way this was going.

We finally made it back to my apartment.  It took me three trips to haul her luggage up.  Attila, claimed she was jet lagged.

“Castle!  Where’s your wine opener?” she asked as I dragged the last bag in.

“What?”  I asked, “It’s in the\- wait why?”

Attila held up a wine bottle.  My wine bottle.  “Lets celebrate!  To friendship”

“I’m really tired.” I  protested.  “Maybe tomorrow.”

“Okay,” she signed.  “I just thought you might want to catch up.  We haven’t spoken in so long.”

I ignored her and showed her to my office where I had put sheets on the couch.

“Where is Kahn going to sleep?” she asked.

“I didn’t really expect him so I’m not sure.” I said

“I usually co sleep with him and we both won’t fit on this couch.  How big is your bed?  He and I could sleep there.”

This, ladies and gentlemen, is where I found my spine.

“Attila, I’m not giving you my bed. There are blankets in the closet that you can lay down for Kahn.  I have work in the morning and I need to go to sleep now.”

She sighed.  “I guess that will work.  Do you have any chips?  I need a snack before bed.”

fatpeoplestories,"We came across this amusing sight at Universal Studios Singapore a few weeks ago whilst on holiday and thought it was too absurd to not share on here. 


First off, the characters:

Be me: Snizles, 5’10”, 155lbs/70kg. Typically heavier when around Feisty, though. I blame her. She’s a bad influence.

Be Feisty: Feisty the Redhead, naturally. 5’4”, 140lbs/65kg. Thick and fit as hell, exercises far more than me. Nugget addict and impatient in queues.

Definitely do not be: Rollercoaster Ham. Paragon of good health at ~350lbs/160kg. Does not listen to important announcements. 





So, this story comes along as we’re queueing up for the Battlestar Galactica ride at Universal. Neither of us are fans, but the coaster itself looked fantastic, so we braved the hour or so wait for it. Met some people from our home city (we were tourists) in the line and had a chat which was lovely. When we finally get to the coaster boarding area is when we first see this hilarious and rather offputting sight.

For reference, during the whole line for the ride, there were constant announcements saying about possible conditions that would preclude you from riding the coaster: pregnancy, height, heart problems, etc. And one general one:

‘YOU MUST BE IN GOOD PHYSICAL HEALTH TO RIDE’

Upon reaching the boarding area, myself and Feisty saw the sight of our lives. Rollercoaster Ham was attempting to jam his obviously too large body into the comparatively tiny seat, spilling over both sides. He’s clearly frustrated that the seat isn’t big enough, but persists anyway. He attempts to pull down the roll bar, but is stopped by his belly, and it won’t lock into place. He tries again. And again. Helpful park employees join in, trying to push it down, hoping that the extra help would finally get this behemoth on his way and out of their hair.

As they try to push it down, you can guess what we hear.

‘YOU MUST BE IN GOOD HEALTH TO RIDE’

Me and Feisty are fixated on the sight of Rollercoaster Ham, but we turn to each other and I start uncontrollably laughing at the irony. I manage to get myself under control fairly quickly and turn back to the spectacle. Their efforts have been unsuccessful, and it looks like our friendly ham will not be able to ride. Except he’s not so friendly.

Upon standing up out of the seat (with much difficulty), he proceeds to berate the employees, who had only tried to help, claiming that the seats ‘weren’t big enough for normal people’, that they had discriminated against him, that because there wasn’t a listed weight limit it was unfair to remove him from the ride, seemingly oblivious to the fact that if he wasn’t secure, he’d be guaranteed a grisly death by being flung off the ride.

This is when it becomes concerning, rather than funny, for me and Feisty. Rollercoaster Ham has become extremely belligerent and loud and is getting in the face of one small employee. Fortunately, credit to Singaporeans, they’re masters at defusing situations, and he is finally ushered away, still moaning about discrimination. When he’s being walked away, I was starting to shake with laughter again, which earned myself an eye roll from Feisty. That said, we were both giggly the whole day reminiscing about it, so she’s not one to talk.

So, that’s our story about the oblivious and hilarious Rollercoaster Ham. We each have a couple more stories from our travels about hams, so you can expect a few more posts on here in the future!

fatpeoplestories,"Full disclosure: I'm a ham in recovery. Basically, I've been hungry all my life and a couple of untreated (didn't know I had them) mental illnesses did me no favors. I binge ate, got help, am medicated, in therapy, blah blah. I'm down almost 40 pounds from my high weight and am a lot saner. 

With that said, I love this sub. It's both hilarious and compassionate for those who are working on their weight. 

The short story: I was picking my high school daughter up yesterday (skinny Minny who luckily doesn't seem to be like me at all. She's built taller and thinner and not a mesomorph now endomorph like me.  And she eats like a normal person).

 Another parent comes out of the high school with her kid. Now, this highschool has tons of large kids. It makes me do a double take, because in the 90s in my highschool, neither I nor any of my friends were even close to chubby, nor were most kids. In the Deep South where even then, we liked our deep fried food and banana pudding.
 
Anyway, back to hammama. 

 I'd  say she was easily 275 lbs, 5'5"" ish if not larger. I gasped so loudly that my daughter was like what's wrong?

This short shirt hammama literally had a good third of her huge, white belly hanging out below her shirt over her jeans. It was a normal length shirt but way too short for  her.   I've never seen anything like it before on a woman. She seemed oblivious. My daughter said ""oh, her? Yeah. I've seen her looking like that before"" and shrugged like it was just another day, and I guess it is in Texas, Murrica. First post but I have others to come.",Hammama and the too short shirt
fatpeoplestories,"This isn’t an FPS in its usual way, but I thought it was worth telling, and my title idea cracked me up.


If you’re grossed out by medical stuff or descriptions, possibly NSFL. TL;DR: Ubiquity of hams as medical patients destroys my vagina.


Last fall, I wanted to get an IUD to stop my periods. I hate them for both gender reasons and because I often suffer from anemia. But, I was really nervous about both having it done, never having had any sort of gynecological exam before, and the potential cost. So, I chose to go to a Planned Parenthood in my city because I heard that they were great with informing and helping new patients, competent in dealing with LGBT people like me, and fairly cheap. I was even able to get in to an appointment within the week!


When I got there with my friend (to drive me), I saw that it was in a rough neighborhood and there were many obese patients. However, I was not deterred and tried not to judge, since part of my work often involves helping people in poverty and/or with criminal records. And anyway, still sort of fat myself. I also enjoyed yelling “I DON’T GET ABORTIONS I’M FUCKING GAY!” at the clinic protestors.


The clinic was not too busy, so my friend and I just sat in an empty part of the waiting room. No proximity to or encounters with hams, yay! After a short while, I was called back, taken to an exam room, and introduced to a very kind, non-ham and LGBT-friendly nurse/midwife who explained the exam and insertion and everything she would do before doing it. 


Nurse even looked me up and down and seemed relieved that I wasn’t huge. Said it should go fairly easily for me.


I was so nervous, though. The only people who had ever done anything to my downstairs before were a college hookup, and my wife. Still, all fine, if a little awkward and...cold and breezy...until the speculum for getting at/past the cervix and to the uterus happened. She warned me that it would be some pain and pressure, but when she opened the speculum inside me...


Okay. Imagine your vagina is the tire, and the speculum is a car jack. The speculum has to hold up all the weight above your vagina, too- the stomach/FUPA. So they’re sturdy little motherfuckers, and obviously you need to put a good amount of force behind opening the “prongs” of it inside a person.


But it’s not supposed to feel like you’re being ripped in half from the hoo-ha out. I very nearly screamed, and taught the poor nurse a lovely array of new German vocabulary words in that moment. Of course, this was concerning, because painful or not, IUD insertion shouldn’t make it feel like an *iEd* went off inside of you. 


Apparently, the nurse had applied a lot of force when using the speculum, and it was opened more than it needed to be. Because, you see, the instrument has to bear so much of your weight from the inside. And she was so used to working on hams, that was the usual way to do it. She apologized several times, but it just got me thinking...how is being so awfully fat normal enough to cause issue when treating a (more) normal, still sort of fat, patient?


Moreover, how can an IUD or birth control work for hams? And how does one even find the uterus?


I was initially pissed at her, but looking back- I just feel bad. Imagine ham-crotch all day as your work.","Hams and Vaginas and Uteri, Oh My!"
fatpeoplestories,"Of course I'll censor real names of the people involved, and as our story is set in Italy, I'll use roman ones instead!

Characters of the story:

* Me, Octavia: 20 yo, student representative of my university course.
* Aureliana: 19 yo, my friend and the other student representative.
* Germanicus: 21 yo, my friend and fellow student, Aureliana's canadian boyfriend.
* Augustus: around 55 yo, chemistry professor and head teacher of the medicine degree course
* Caesar: 22 yo, I believe he is like 1m75 for 150 kgs, also an heavy smoker and ""proud mysoginist"" \(he said that, really...\)

This november I started to study medicine in my hometown, I love what I'm doing, I ended up being student representative and my collegues are all super\-nice and friendly. Everyone, except a person: Caesar.

He hates everyone for no reason, is always rude and thinks to know everything: even if you're chatting with a friend about, I don't know, how your holydays were, you can be sure that he will show up, interrupt you and start lecturing about how stupid you were and what you would have done instead. Nevertheless, he's one of the worst students, he passed just one exam with a low grade during the whole year...

I met him on my first day of uni and, at the start, he just seemed a bit arrogant, but nothing more. I was so wrong...

He immediately started to make fun of people for no reason, for literally everything, but his first episode of fat logic was during a conversation that me and Aureliana were having with Augustus.

He's a man who loves food, but the healthy and deliciuos kind, and we were talking about how junk food is is ruining a lot of lives and how much it will cost to the healthcare system in the future, so Augustus started to tell us that he dries apricots at home and brings them to uni and offers them to students to encourage healthy eating.

An here it comes our hero, Caesar...

He arrived out of the blue laughing and saying: ""I wouldn't take them! Healthy food just makes you sad and ugly, all the girls in our course are too fucking skinny!"" \(just because none of us is overweight...\)

Me and Aureliana were cringing too much to say something, while Augustus just replied ""You will discover during this course that what you say is wrong, trust me...""

After this episode, we understood what kind of person Caesar is, but it didn't end up here...

Germanicus is a guy who loves sports very much, but he is still a bit overweight \(not too much, anyway\) for bad eating habits.

He was taliking about how much he missed baseball and that it's a shame there aren't many places to play it in Italy, of course Caesar arrived to give us his preciuos wisdom.

""Well, here people are way thinner and baseball is a sport that you can do only if you are really fat. 

If you want to lose weight you can start smoking, like me."", after insulting him, he started to tell us about how much dieting and exercise are a ""stupid way"" to lose weight, and that smoking is way more effective. 

I mean, he wants to be a doctor. A FUCKING DOCTOR, GUYS!

He continued to be a dick with everyone during the year, but the other episodes are not fatlogic\-related, so I don't think it's appropriate to mention them.

Maybe the only relevant one is when he posted on his facebook that he was angry because there was a campaign to tax more tobacco and junk food, and he suggested how ""women are more than fat people and smokers, so they should increase prices of tampons and pads instead"" \(as they weren't already taxed enough...\)

Hope you liked this little gem of fatlogic, I think that if others similiar episodes occur I'll post them here!","The adventures of Caesar, Emperor of Rudeness"
fatpeoplestories,"Today my husband, I and our 5 kids went out to breakfast. 

Background: [My husband has told me he does not find me attractive anymore](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/8fe26c/i_asked_for_a_divorce_update/) because of my weight (I am 5’9” and 230lbs. He is 6’1” and 310lbs.) I have made a conscious effort to change my eating and exercise habits, keeping myself to a 1200 calorie diet (often staying below 900) and hitting the gym daily since he has said this. 

Fast forward to breakfast: We go to a local steakhouse on Sundays sometimes because they have cheap kids meals and my husband needs breakfast as a reward for going to church (lol). They have insane portions, literally. Their omelettes are six eggs, their burgers are 1/2 lbs, etc. 

I asked him if he would like to split a six egg omelette and he laughed and pressured me to get my own. I scoured the menu and came up with the two egg breakfast which came with hash browns and toast. I thought that was reasonable and mentally estimated it to be about 600-700 calories and figured I would skip lunch and dinner, and just have a small snack before bed to compensate. I ordered a black coffee for good measure, instead of the soda we both usually get. 

I felt so good about myself! 

Until the check came. His 6 egg sausage and cheese omelette, smothered with gravy, with a plate of biscuits and gravy on the side and a coke to top it off, came to over $18. My 3 eggs (I added on a side of egg for extra protein), hash browns, dry rye toast (that I ended up giving to the kids), and black coffee came to a bit over $9. 

He scowled at the bill. “Coffee is ridiculously expensive here,” he said.

fatpeoplestories,"Do you see those posts about  how ""brave"" it is for obese people to go out, to eat in public, to go shopping, and to have a pedicure. 
When an obese woman walk in, she has to walk side way through the door. Her car parks 15 feet away from the register, and you could hear her huff, huff, huff, and huff. She asks to have her feet done, but too tired to pick out a color on the self one fricking foot next to her, so she orders you to pick out her color. 
Her body is about four times bigger than you (105 lb). You look at your boss with a bubbie eyes, but you boss is a pussy so he didnt say anything (fat people discrimination at a salon is a serious crime.) She sits down on the chair. You could hear crack, crack, crack. Half of her fat leg cannot fit in the chair. And her fat feet barely fit in the tub. You could not push the armrest down. Other nail techs look at you with pitty sorry eyes. 
You know how people are so big they could not bend down to tough their toes, how they cannot stand on one foot for a second, how their foot only fit half of the flip flop, how greasy their feet are. When she puts her foot on the footrest, the stench of a biggest fungus hits you, you actually puke in your mouth. The foot cracks are filled with filth, look like a hundred year old unwash feet. You bit your lips and start to cut her toe nails. The fat somehow migrates to her toes you could not feel the toe bone. The fat covers her toes, you could not see the cuticle. So you begin to dig out dirt and grease on her nails. And when you try to lift her fat leg...omg your back wants to retire. You rub her feet till squeaky clean (on her demand.) All the mean time, complain ""skinny girl cant give a good massage."" ""Fuck it"" you tought. Go get her hot towel, paint it fast and sloppy (as if she can see it).

fatpeoplestories,"Hello /r/fatlogic. I have a hammy aunt who has been a pain in the ass for a long time. Finally I've decided to tell you about her.

Me 5""3 and 125lbs. Extremely concious about my weight and often get comments on my tummy

Hammy aunt. 5""3 and 170lbs. An extremely toxic and selfish woman. She and my uncle live with uncles's mother (my grandmother) along with their 2 kids. Uncle is unemployed. Family of 4 depends entirely on grandma's pension. Hoping to take over grandma's house as well.

Aunt and her kids live entirely on kfc, shwarmas and McDonald's. They can eat full huge meals and call it a ""snack"". On top of that, all of them are rude, selfish jerks. Even the kids are bratty snots.

Aunt even has guts to flirt with my dad (her brother in law) when we go visit grandma. Unlike uncle, dad has a job and supports his mother financially instead of mooching off her.

Sorry for rant but I wanted to give you idea on what kind of person she is. Back to story, aunt often enjoys making fun of my weight and calling me fat. I've been very self concious these days and struggling with myself. Few days ago, we went to visit. Aunt stuffed her face with the food grandma ordered and when I reached out for the plate, she slapped my hand away. Aaaaaalight then. I didn't say anything. I decided to forgive that one. Then I reached out for the soda and she slapped my hand away.

Fuck this shit

I looked straight into her eyes and told her to mind her own business. She smirked and told me I'm a fat pig. She also said no man would marry a fat girl like me (we're Pakistani and girls are often under pressure to look perfect for marriage). I slammed the plate down and left. I didn't fight her. I just left.

Today, my mom revealed to me that aunt had been telling mom ""your daughter is getting fat. Who's gonna want a fat girl like that? Take away her food if she eats too much"". Mom didn't defend me either.....


I just had to rant about her to you people",I was fatshamed by a ham
fatpeoplestories,"In Germany, we do not have really obese people in those quantities like the authors beyond the Atlantic seem to have. However, once in a while you can encounter one of them (Germany is quite an overweight country and developing into a more obese population, slowly, unfortunately).

This is the story when I did encounter an obese person with a difficult attitude in the underground tram (U Bahn) in a German city. I was not in a good mood to begin with on that day and can be quite unconventionally aggressive verbally (for a German). I was working at a trade show as sales for 5 days, 2 days supervising construction, 3 days constantly standing around, being friendly, meeting customers, explaining products and company, etc. everything quite tiring. Moreover, it was very hot at that time of the year, each day about 30 degrees Celsius. As you all can imagine, I was done for and happy to go home by underground and train, as soon as the show was over. I had to bring with me 5 bags all in all ( Small suitcase for airplane handluggage, PC, handbag, bag with tradeshow stuff and a bottle of wine). 

When I entered the underground tram, I was lucky to get a seat in a row where two rows face each other, because it was only the second station and the waggon was still quite empty. These rows are usually already pretty tight concerning foot space, so I sat down and ""tetrised"" all my bags in front of me and on my lap. I sat at the window, an older lady sat next to me and a man sat diagonally from me. On the seat facing me, only a child could have sat, since my bags took the space where another pair of feet could go. This is, of course, not an ideal situation, but the best I could do to. On a side note, you are not allowed to put bags into the corridor, since this is an escape route. There are also no overhead compartments. The most logical thing, therefore, was to sit down and keep my bags as close to myself as possible, so that nothing falls, or breaks.

After 2-3 more stops (of about 15 stops from trade show to train station) the waggon gets filled up, people standing on the corridor and U Bahn-ham enters. She looked like she definitely weighed over 150kg (330lbs), which in Germany is still an uncommon sight. Her belly was big, so were her legs. Ever so polite, as the Germans are, the man diagonally from me offered the U Bahn-ham his seat, and she sat down with a distinctly uncomfortable look on her face. She must have been embarassed, that the man, now called Mr. Gentleman, offered her the seat, although she was neither old nor sick looking nor pregant, but only really obese. Her belly and leg fat did spread, by the way, to the half of the seat that was not occupied facing me. 

I said she must have been embarassed, otherwise she would not have launched this random attack and unloading shit on whoever was just there to be her victim! Anyway, she glared at my bags and the fact, that I was blocking the footspace of the seat in front of me with them. So, in a passive aggressive kind of voice she asked: ""Who do these bags belong to?"" She asked that in an accusingly inquisitive tone and I was thinking ""Oh god, I know something like this would come"". So I just snarled ""It's mine"", because remember, I was in a really bad mood already and absolutely not up to deal with a hamplanet who tried to shift attention away from her weight taking up  space towards other things taking up space, like my bags! So, she launched her attack at me, saying things like ""You should put those bags away, so that someone can sit on the seat in front of you"". I was getting angrier, because both she and I knew, that with everyone sitting and standing in our near vicinity, there was no way for me to move anywhere or making space. Mr. Gentleman who got up for U Bahn-ham intercepted here, that it is forbidden to place bags in the corridor.

She was, of course, not calmed down by Mr. Gentleman and let the topic go, but continued to lash out at me, but always in that passive-aggressive way and by God, I hate that. If someone has a problem with me, go talk to me into my face! She said something like: ""Always these people coming from the trade shows with their bags, taking away so much space, *siiiiiigh*."" That is when I had enough and I shouted at her in my best Bavarian accent (which sounds quite harsh to some people): "" Now listen to me, you have no idea, what kind of exhausting trade show week I had and yes, I need to go to the station and yes, I use the U Bahn! What do you expect me to do, walk? At least I could do it! However, the tram is here for everyone, regardless! So, if  you have nothing important to tell me, leave me the fuck alone!"" The funny thing is, that Mr. Gentleman actually did this ""Ladies, calm down please"" thing, but I was done with this woman, and she did not at all expect an ""Alpha""-like come-back, so she did leave me alone and did some faux-happy chit-chat with some Spanish passenger in the tram waggon. Meanwhile steam was coming from my ears and I was glaring out of the window until I and many other people got out at the train station.

You see, what made me so angry in all of this, was that her lashing out at me was completely pointless, since I could neither move me or my things anywhere else at this point, cause the tram was packed. Taking the tram with a lot of stuff is always uncomfortable for everybody, especially when it is full. You do your best not to inconvenience people, and that means, make yourself as small as possible, what I tried to do. She of course, could not do that and was well aware of that! Noone else could have sat in the seat next to her anyway. I wish I would have pointed out something like that, but I just wanted to be left alone and go home. Having an argument in a public place in Germany is very uncommon and also embarassing, but I was very happy, that I did not let her bash me verbally for taking away foot space for somebody else to sit, when half of the seat was taken anyway by her ass! Rant over!

TL;DR U Bahn-Ham thinks, that an already blocked seat can be used, when she covers half of it with her fat.

fatpeoplestories,"So generally I don't post things like this, but my husband said I should because he was just as astounded as I was by this.

In this story there's:

Me, I'm 5'9 and about 164lbs at 31 weeks pregnant.
My daughter: typical 2 year old
Rude thief: a very VERY large woman, about 2 inches shorter than me, but large enough to take up 2 seats in the waiting area of the DMV.

So 2 days ago I decided to go to get my name changed on my license, since I'd recently gotten married and had free time between a doctor appointment and the older kids getting home from school. The waiting area was mostly empty, and since I had started the process online all I had to do was fill in a small section of some paperwork and show them the certificate. Easy stuff.

I sit in one of the empty rows and sit my daughter next to me so I can fill in this paper, and I hand her a bag with a few Graham cracker pieces in it to keep her occupied while I do this. Not even a minute later this huge woman comes and sits a few seats down from us. No biggie, there's plenty of room and I'm more focused on getting done so we can get out. She's side eyed my daughter a few times, which makes me a little uncomfortable but I'm keeping watch of her. I finish filling in the paper and turn to set down my purse and retrieve the certificate I need from it when I hear my daughter start to throw a fit. I turn back around and this bitch has moved herself next to my child and is holding her bag of graham crackers in her pudgy hands.

Me: excuse me?? Did you just take my daughter's crackers?

Rude thief: oh were these hers? I thought they were abandoned.

Me: no you didn't, they were in her hands. You took food out of my child's hands, why would you do that?

RT: she obviously isn't very interested in them.

Me: (at this point I'm very WTF about this whole thing) how fucking far gone are you that you can't control yourself not to take food out of a 2 year old's hands, you fat bitch?

RT: HEY! I'm not fat!! I have a condition! You're the one being a bitch!!!

Me: binge eating disorder is not a fucking condition. Fucking learn to control yourself, and don't you DARE take food from a small child like that again.

I snatched the bag back out of her hands, picked up my daughter and walked down to the other end of the waiting area right as my number was called. Last I saw security was asking to have a word with her, as someone who had been sitting near us had alerted them to the issue.

For real though, what the actual fuck. Who takes food from a kid like that and thinks it's okay??",A DMV experience I'll never forget
fatpeoplestories,"Obligatory first time poster, long time lurker. This just happened this morning, and I'm still shaking my head in disbelief.

I live in an area of the US littered with Ubiquitous Orange and Purple Coffee Shops(TM). My small town alone has four of these shops (compared to only two StarBeetus). 

Spring is struggling to break through here in Dunkin' Land. It's a chilly, gray, cloudy day, and on the way back from an errand I decided I needed a little pick-me-up before getting back to work. As I entered the parking lot, I noticed a car parked haphazardly in the fire lane, even though there were plenty of other spots open. For whatever reason, this type of assholery is common at this particular location, which is one reason I try to avoid it and go to another one in town.

I entered and took my place in line behind a planet I'll call Green Eggs and Ham (GEAH) - aptly named because she was decked out entirely in bright green, including matching earrings and nail polish (last I heard, St. Patrick's day was well over a month ago). GEAH was probably 5'6"", and at least 400 lbs. Her gut hung down nearly to her knees - a gunt, if you will. I felt myself being sucked into her gravitational pull as I took my place behind her in line.

GEAH was impatiently hovering behind the customer in front of her, huffing and making grunting noises indicating her displeasure at having to wait for her sugahs. As the poor older woman in front of her was trying to get her order, GEAH kept inching closer and closer to the counter, breathing heavily and rolling her eyes. The older lady, clearly uncomfortable, turned around to try to make some space between her and GEAH. She smiled at GEAH and, trying to be friendly, said, ""I like your nail polish! That's a great color."" GEAH just grunted a ""yeah"" and continued audibly breathing.

Once GEAH finally got up to the counter, she ordered a medium iced tea with 4 lemons and ""a little bit of sugar, I'm trying to watch my weight."" She also ordered two bacon egg and cheese croissant sandwiches, extra bacon, extra eggs, and extra cheese (hence, Green Eggs and Ham). Yup, definitely watching her weight. A regular bacon egg and cheese croissant comes in at 530 kcals, with 33 grams of fat. It took two workers to fulfill her order.

Finally, GEAH gets her order and waddles away. I step up to order my decaf coffee with cream. Before I can even open my mouth, GEAH cuts in front of me, pushing me aside with her considerable girth (did I mention I'm 6 months pregnant?) and thunders, ""I NEED MOAR SUGAR IN MY DRINK."" I stand there dumbfounded. She thrusts her cup at the cashier and reiterates ""MY DRINK'S NOT SWEET ENOUGH."" 

The cashier starts spooning sugar into the drink. After each spoon she looks up at GEAH, who grunts ""Moar."" I swear to you, readers, I counted 12 scoops of sugar added to that iced tea before GEAH told the cashier to ""give it here."" At that point, the cup was filled almost halfway with sugar. GEAH grabbed the cup, took a swig, and deemed it had enough sweetness for her liking. 

I was still standing there, probably gaping in disbelief since it's rare for me to encounter planets out in the wild. GEAH looked over at me, and, probably thinking I was looking at her super dangly earrings, informed me ""I GOT THEM IN ITALY."" I just nodded weakly. GEAH took that as her cue to wobble away. On her way out, she grabbed a hammy fistful of ketchup and additional sugar packets.

As I exited the store with my decaf, I see GEAH crammed into the car that was parked in the fire lane, complaining to someone on speakerphone that ""this store always screws up my order."" I can only imagine the greasy, buttery handprints left behind in her car after her ""snack.""",Dunkin' Beetus Ham

Then you have our newest hire, who was brought in last week. Maybe about my height, just a hair shorter, and...well...large, tbh. To the point where I've seen her break the level raiser on the computer chair at work. 




Anyway, this new job is a pretty physical job. I spend eight hours on my feet except for designated breaks and like 5 minutes of email and paperwork, and I lift heavy boxes the whole time, ranging from 42-50 pounds.




We get a new hire, who doesn't really approve of this despite the fact that this job is one of the best ""no experience necessary"" jobs in the area, if not *the* best.




She *has* to have a stool to sit on at her machine, a 30 minute break every hour and a half isn't enough *time*, the boxes are *too heavy*.




I think the dealbreaker here though, is going to be the food thing.




Our company deals with food grade stuff, and *nothing* can be contaminated with particles of stuff that isn't the product. Which means we have to wash our hands after eating, after smoke breaks, etc.




And there cannot be, absolutely under no circumstances, food on the lines. At all. Period. That dog ain't hunting. In fact, all we're allowed to have at all is medication and plain water outside the break rooms. 




For normal people, this isn't a problem. I've completely kicked my soda habit by drinking plain water out on the floor, then carbonated water in the breakrooms. 




For this chick though, it's practically a death sentence. She's already been written up twice for bringing candy out on the floor, and putting Mio in her water bottles, citing ""medical conditions"" and ""not liking the taste of pure water"" as her reasonings. 




Naturally, this was shot down pretty quick when her physical revealed she did not have any medical conditions that would require eating candy more frequently than every hour and a half, and she wasn't a damn child qho could grow up and save her Mio for break.




We were getting audited this week and points were deducted for her hiding a bottle of Mountain Dew in our area.




Y'all, our pay raise possibilities are partially based on that.




I will fight her.

Me and my dad are walking about Walmart doing some shopping for basic stuff like paper towels and milk. We arrive at the checkout, we see him, LA accompanied by grandmother who is probably 65+ years of age. They have a scootypuff but grandma isn’t the one riding, it’s LA. Their cart is a pretty clear mix of things for grandma (flour, tea, crackers) and things for LA( Mountain Dew, Oreos). As they add their items to the conveyor grandma offloads most items and then moves to pay. She quietly directs LA to load the rest. He proceeds to stretch and try to pick up and place items without any separation between his fat ass and the seat. Eventually grandma grows tired of this and does the rest herself. I watch this with a mix of rage and disdain. I’m an Army brat and every army brat who reads this will tell you, your military parents makes damn sure of your manners and work ethic. Eventually, you grow a personal investment in seeing that these virtues are upheld. Watching this unfold is the closest I’ve come to slapping the shit out of some kid in public. The divide between our ages wasn’t especially large but the lack of maturity present in this kid was. I glanced over at my dad and notice he his face has settled into the stone faced glare that denotes he’s about to get angry.

fatpeoplestories,"So I know this guy, whom I'll call Dwight, because personality-wise, he slightly reminds me of Dwight from The Office. He *loooooovvvveeesssss* lecturing. I don't know what to call that personality trait, but basically, any statement you make, no matter how benign, he'll find an opportunity to interrupt you and then start lecturing. I'll put examples in the comments so it doesnt get too long. 

Dwight and I are part of this ""networking group"". I'm not sure what it's called, but I've been part of it for nearly 10 years now. We come from 4-5 different countries and we meet 3-4x a year for a weekend, to discuss various topics to share our different perspectives. I've never really liked Dwight, but the reasons belong to /r/badpeoplestories and I'll write them one day when I have the time for it. Anyway, this is the fatlogic part.

This weekend, it was held in my country, so I hosted Dwight and another guy, while the other person from my country, Erin, hosted everyone else since she practically lives in a mansion within an apartment building. 

**Arrival**

Most of the group arrived really late at night so by that time the only restaurants still open were junk food places or bars. Everyone agreed to just order burgers and eat at my place. Dwight arrived earliest, so I had to entertain him first. To tide him over food-wise, I made him roasted cauliflower (only 1 tbs of coconut oil for 2 heads!) tossed with tandoori powder and served with hummus. 

Then everyone arrived and, understandably since airline food sucks, started ordering in an insane amount of junk food. To make sure people were at least getting fruits and veggies, I made poached asparagus drizzled with homemade herbed butter and served a fruit platter.

I was busy catching up with everyone, so Dwight didn't have to opportunity to piss me off.

**Saturday**

So everyone was joking about how relieved my husband must be that I'm letting eat so much junk food last night and I was laughing along with them. I told them his diet isn't *that* bad, and I'm pretty chill with food options. We eat whatever, there's no restrictions, I just make sure there's a lot of servings of vegetables with every meal so that's the largest part of our meals and I mostly serve fish since I need those natural DHA. My philosophy is just to keep every meal as nutrient rich as possible, especially since I have an autoimmune disease (Sjögren's, not too serious but can be a bitch).

""Do *you* know your asparagus has loads of butter?"" Dwight piped up.

Yes, Dwight, I cooked it. I know how much butter I put in it. About 1/4 cup for 600g (~1.3lbs) of asparagus. Not that healthy but I care about taste too.

""Yeah, that's why I say my husband's 'diet' isn't that b-"" I started.

""You *know* that's really not healthy right?"" Dwight cut me off, ""It's so much butter.""

""It's still better than the burger, tater tots, cheese fries and nachos you were eating,"" I snapped back.



**Sunday**

Dwight insisted on ramen noodles, so Erin was ordering some for everyone for our morning meeting. I haven't been feeling that great, so I asked her if she had oatmeal at her place so I could eat my usual breakfast food instead of the noodles.

""Since when have *you* eaten oatmeal?"" Dwight demanded.

""Er...since I was young?"" I replied, ""I normally eat muesli or oatmeal for breakf-""

""Do you know it has a lot of sugar?"" Dwight interrupted.

""Oh I don't use the flavoured instant oatmeals, I usually just make my own wi-""

""Yeah, but the oatmeal itself has a lot of sugar. Carbs, you know.""

""I don't care about avoiding any carbs, and I'm not doing it to lose weight."" For real. I recently found out I'm now skinny enough to fit into runway sizes and I think that's thin enough for me. 

""Well, I'm talking about your health. There's several schools of thoughts, and people think it's healthier to just have a lot of vegetables and protein, and you know what, never mind!"" Dwight stopped himself mid-lecture to sigh exasperatedly as if I'm too stupid to understand him.

I quickly escaped before he changed his mind and mumbled something about needing to grab something from my room. I realized I left my phone and kindle outside, and my husband's still asleep, but whatever. I rather sit in darkness in utter boredom than risk another conversation with Dwight.

Bitch, don't hate on my oatmeal when you're eating fucking RAMEN NOODLES. 

Anyway. We ended up at Erin's and Dwight found coconut water in her fridge and started drinking it. 

""Erin. Why you chose this brand of coconut water?"" he demanded.

""It's made by one of my family's companies."" she replied.

""Why do you put so much sugar in this?"" he demanded.

""For taste,"" Erin replied shortly. She's also sick of his shit, for reasons I'll explain in the comments. 

""But sugar is *unhealthy*, right?"" he started lecturing condescendingly, as if she were an idiot, ""This is *completely* unhealthy, why do you bother putting sugar into it?""

""Because it's a soft drink and they have to sell it!"" I snapped at him.

""But why put sugar in it and make it unhealthy?"" Dwight plodded on, ""Do you know suga-"" 

""Because it's not for health. If you want water, you're welcome to it. We're *all* drinking water."" Erin cut him off.

We're so sick of his shit.",Let me lecture everyone on what to eat while I eat shit.

fatpeoplestories,"First off, forgive any spelling or grammar errors, my first language is trailer trash and I keep getting distracted by Trolls.

I've seen quite a few boy scout camp stories in the series list which reminded me of my time in girl scouts. Just because we sold delicious cookies does not mean we were exempt from the trials of fat logic, even though that wasn't really a thing yet. 

I spent my girl scout career in the same troop with pretty much the same girls the whole time. One of which was Bergen, the scout leader's daughter (I know y'all like numbers. I was 4'11 and a size 12-14 kids at the time of this particular story. She was about three or four inches taller but an adult 12. I know because she used to go on about how we wore the same size...). I saw her once a week and for atleast a couple weekends each year for 12 years, so lots of stories, but this is the one that stands out most in my mind.

When we were Juniors (7th grade so I was around 13 at the time) we started being able to elect troop officers from among the girls, leader, secretary, treasurer, etc. If you thought the race for high school class president was bad, hoo boy you ain't seen nothing compared to 15 catty 13 year olds trying to look good on college resumés. The race came down to me and Bergen and, due to my experience talking four brothers into doing shit they'd rather not do, I talked my way into the Leader position. Bergen was mad. I thought nothing of this because my first task as leader was throwing together our yearly camping trip scheduled to take place in a few weeks with some other troops from our unit. Lots of phone tag and headache pills later, it was camping time!

Our troop always did our camping trips to a big camp ground owned by the Girl Scouts about two hours away from us. Let's call it Camp Sequoia. We'd meet at a church, load all our gear into two huge vans, and drive our Scout Leader and the Assistant Leader bonkers for a couple hours while they silently wished for coffee and ear plugs. 

This is FPS. Do I even need to tell you who didn't help us pack the cars and instead sat on her behind glaring at us over her Starbeetus? Because if you guessed the roly poly Bergen, give yourself a gold star. My best scout friend Poppy and I were assigned to the same car (and thus same tent at camp! We were so excited) so we busted our butts getting it packed so we could leave for camp sooner. After far too long to my hyperactive 13 year old brain, shit was packed and we could be on our way. I go to clamber in the front seat (I got awful car sickness. Plus I could read a map. Front seat was mine!) and a jerk on the collar of my shirt stops me.

Bergen: I need the front seat.

Me, confused as shit: But I always sit in the front seat. Besides, you're in the other tent. You're supposed to ride with your mom.

Bergen: I switched with RandomGS so I could be in the tent with Bergen'sBestie. Besides, I'm bigger! I can't fit in the back seat with the other girls. You're a shrimp, you can fit.

(I may be embellishing here. It's been almost 17 years. Dialogue becomes hazy after a while. But she called me shrimp and twig and bookworm a lot so take your pick.)

I look at Assistant Scout Leader for help and she just sighs and motions me to one of the back seats. Such is life in our troop. Luckily I had been too excited to eat that morning, so other than a stop at the grocery store for supplies, we only had to stop twice for me to hork up orange juice. Side note, never drink orange juice before a car ride if you are prone to motion sickness. 

The grocery store was a tale in itself. Bergen kept trying to sneak Beetus food into the cart that was definitely not on the troop approved meal plan. Relevant to this story though is the meal plan for Sunday morning was breakfast burritos and chocolate milk because why the fuck would you let 13 year old girls plan their own meals? But I digress. One girl, Smidge, was allergic to eggs, but loved pop tarts so she got a box for herself, and myself and Poppy were both lactose intolerant so we got orange juice. I'm an orange juice fiend and Poppy didn't care what she drank as long as it didn't send her to the bathroom for three hours and make her wish she was dead.

What seems like forever later we arrive at Camp Sequoia. We're at one of the further camp sites but I fought for it because it was closest to the big campfire we always did and I dislike tripping over my own feet in the dark. Unfortunately for Bergen, that means we have to load all of our stuff into big wagons and haul them up to the site. 14 girls load the wagons. One sits her fat ass in an empty wagon and makes BergenBestie haul her the whole way. My memory wants to say it was over a mile and uphill the whole way, but my memory is faulty and lesbihonest I was tiny and skinnyfat. A flight of stairs looked really imposingly tall at the time. 

I'm going to fast forward through to the next day. Basically we unpacked, worked on some badges, and took a nature walk all to the tune of Bergen whining about her knees and her non-existent asthma. Sucks to your ass-mar, Bergen. The asthma thing only became an issue after the Assistant Scout Leader and her daughter Smidge joined our troop. Smidge was about my size, sweet as pie, and was part of a dance team 5 days a week. She was allowed to sit out of activities if she thought they'd bring on an attack. She never once complained the whole trip. 

Anyway, the next morning Assistant Scout Leader's watch starts going off at the ass crack of dawn, rousing us all from our nice warm sleeping bags into the slight morning chill. We grumble, pull on slightly damp sweatshirts (dat humidity yo, it's a killer!) and trundled off to our assigned morning chores. Poppy and I were supposed to clean bathrooms as I was banned from anything remotely near the fire after an incident involving Assistant Scout Leader's hairspray and a lighter at a camping trip earlier that year, while Bergen and Bergen'sBestie were supposed to clean up the eating area and set tables. Bergen promptly fucks off and leaves Bergen'sBestie to do all the work. A few of the other girls start preparing the meal. 

Finally breakfast is done and we are all called back by the delicious smell of eggs and sausage and the promise of hot sauce. Bergen wanders out of the tents, eager for breakfast and shoves her way into the front of the line. Smidge imediately makes a break for the pop tarts but they are not to be found. Orange juice, nectar of the gods? Also gone. Leftover marshmallows from the night before? Yeah no. All the girls are set to searching coolers and two of them are sent back to search the vans. No poptarts. No OJ. Maybe a raccoon got the marshmallows. We were pretty tired the night before... Poppy and I, having dealt with Bergen before, decide to check the tents. And what to our wandering eyes should appear but the remains of an obvious feast and an empty orange juice container. I gathered up the evidence and marched it back to the picnic tables.

Me, motioning to empty silver wrappers and other trash: Guess where we found it?

Scout Leader just does her eyebrow quirk. Pretty sure she knew where we found it. 

Poppy, near tears: It was all under Bergen's bed, in her duffle bag!

Bergen: Why were you in my stuff?!

Me: Why were you in our food?!

Engage fatlogic!

Bergen: It's not my fault! I was so hungry this morning and I had to do soooo much work! I was feeling faint! I had to eat it!

Me: But muh orange jewce :((

Scout Leader butts in and tells us to drop it. As it was bought out of troop money, the food technically belongs to the troop. There's really nothing that can be done now. Bergen is assigned to heat the water for dishwashing as punishment, Smidge cries into her PB sandwhich, Poppy is allowed some of Assistant Scout Leader's coffee, and I'm told I'm hyper enough, get some kool-aid. I fume into my burrito and stalk off during free time after dishes. 

My mind is torn between the pacifist religion I was born into yelling at me to let it go, turn the other cheek, peace on earth and goodwill to men, yadda yadda, and my (slightly crazy, very scottish) great grandma's voice telling me nae! Make the cunt pay!

Then I see it. A beautiful lime green spider that's probably bigger than my fist has built a web across the path. Bergen is terrified of spiders. She's still emptying out the basins from washing. 

I got that spider on a peace of wood.

fatpeoplestories,"I've seen several posts here recently talking about their fat mothers, and I guess I decided to share my story. It's not as extreme as some I've read on here, but I wonder if someone can relate to it.

It's hard loving someone who doesn't love you back. That's especially true if that someone is your parent. There are lots of stories I could share about my mom, but this isn't the time or place for most of them. 

My whole life, my mother has made me feel like a burden. I obviously know raising kids can be hard, but she signed up to be a parent. Everyday, I would be told that I ""ruined"" her body. Like a lot of women, she stayed fat after her first pregnancy. Somehow, this was my fault. In her mind, I had apparently magically decided how calories and female biology works.

She also never had enough food in the house. If I would ask for food, I would be told I was such a burden and food is too expensive. My parents both had phds and decent jobs. We were not poor. She had enough food for herself, just not where I could find it. Whenever I ate, she would steal some of my food to ""just taste"" it. I was underweight for my entire childhood, but she still told me I was too fat and didn't deserve food.",When fatlogic meets narcissism
fatpeoplestories,"My mom was never active even when she was skinny. The only reason she kept her weight down was because she was a drug addict and it killed her appetite when she wasn't puking from the overdose. She never played with us or took us anywhere growing up because she spent most of her time high out of her mind.

It took five tries at rehab, but it worked and I thought we were going to get to try again. We both have the same congenital knee defect that leads to knee dislocation and scar tissue. Growing up she refused to let me play sports because it supposedly meant that we would never be able to run or be super active without damaging my knee. My mom was a nurse before her addiction so she never actually took me to a specialist because she deemed herself qualified to treat my condition.

The moment I left the house I made an appointment with an orthopedic specialist because I desperately wanted to find a way to be more active, even if it required surgery. Call me surprised when he looks at me like I have two heads and explains to me that exercise will actually reduce the symptoms of my defect because it'll give the uneffected muscle more ability to compensate for the defect!

My mom blamed it on a shitty doctor and I believed her because her doctor had also convinced her that if she allowed me to take birth control it would turn me into a slut because ""hormones."" She even seemed super enthusiastic about the physical therapy plan I had been given by my doctor!

By this point my mom had replaced her drug addiction with a food addiction and had ballooned. She was now four inches shorter than me but weighed twice as much as I did. It didn't take two weeks before she told me that her c section scar was making it impossible for her to work out. She had to have an emergency c section with me and admittedly they had botched the incision pretty bad so it was much larger than average and had keloided badly after the fact. But the rapid stretching of her stomach due to weight gain meant that it was constantly inflamed, so I told her that she could just diet for a while and when her skin slacked up more she could start walking with me again.

Then she got diagnosed with MS. I went with her to her doctors appointment and her doctor told her she had to lose weight because the constant inflammation caused by the weight would speed up the degeneration of her disease because it would aggravate her auto immune response. She gave my mom a diet to follow and we agreed to diet together.

It's a year later. She has just gained more weight. Everytime I come over she thinks I don't see the fried chicken boxes stuffed down in the garbage can. Or didn't see the twinkies box behind her pots and pans. She has a pile of Mountain Dew bottles in the back seat of her car from where she ""cheats"" supposedly once a week on the way to work. She promises that she is dieting but it just isn't possible for her because of the medications she is taking. She has a hysterectomy and supposedly the hormones she has to take inflate the problem also.

She now has MS flare ups where she can't walk and has to have her boyfriend carry her around the house. She has started choking on her meals and I know her swallowing is getting harder. She hides when her appointments are and won't talk about her head x rays. So I'm sure she has more lesions. My dad passed away when I was 21, and I think I'm going to lose my mom soon too.

I made the mistake of going to one yesterday, mid Monday morning. It was hot as hell even though we're in Autumn (Fall) and there were about 4 people ahead of me with big bags and boxes of cans and bottles in bags. 

At first it seemed like the usual lineup, but I noticed the line I got in was going really slowly. 
At the front of it was what looked to be a nice early teens boy with blonde hair and downs syndrome or a disorder of some sort. He was a bit vacant, moving slowly and with a very slack expression.

fatpeoplestories,"I had this friend in high school who was “curvy” in the wrong way. She might have had a nice hourglass figure if she had cut out the carbs (and the sweets, and snacks, and the uber-portions) and opted for a walk on the weekends, but she was just tipping the scales around 190. And she was not a tall lady.      
The problem was, she was also in denial. She wasn’t fat enough to require plus-sized shops, but was no size 4, either. Yet whenever shopping she’d always buy a size S and stretch that fabric to its physical limits. She thought that tight clothes were not only sexy, but that her curves were of the sort that ought to be displayed in such manner.     
She looked like a stuffed sausage.      
I think I’ll call her Sausage from now on.     
    
So, every so often, Sausage would come and complain to us about the way her clothes were fitting. Inevitably, it would be a jab at the fabric. I remember this pair of white capris she had mushed into that had responded by developing horizontal stretch marks across the thighs. She came in complaining about the lines.     
“Sometimes the fabric is just sewn that way. It’s probably a cheap brand,” I tried to reason.     
But by god she pressed the issue. “But it didn’t hang like this on the hanger,” she said. Or, “I ironed it and everything.”      
The fact of the matter was that she was just too fat for the pants. Her rolls were spilling out the top. The fabric was stretched to the extreme. Her top, too, was so tight that you could see not only the structure of her underwire bra, but count the protruding rolls of fat forced out of the way. And she liked to brag she had a small rib cage.      
What did she want? For me to call her out? To let her know she was fat and that her clothes were too tight? It’s like she knew it, but didn’t want to be told it, but wanted to be told so, or something... I never said outright to her face that I thought so. I guess we were friends and I didn’t want to hurt her. But what did she want??     
       
What made it all worse was how Sausage would bash other fatties. We’d be in the mall, and spot some hamplanet lumbering around, and she’d spurt out, “oh my god she should NOT be wearing THAT.” Or make comments about not knowing tents were available at Hot Topic.      
All this while guzzling cheese fries or a huge slushie.     
One time it irked me just enough to quip back at her. She said something like, “that lardass could stand to run around the block a few times.”        
So I sighed and responded, “you know we could all use a little exercise and a little less food now and then.”      
She turned and looked at me like, “what would you need it for? You’re so skinny you’re built like a boy. If you went on a diet you’d snap in half.”      
I laughed it off, but couldn’t really say anything. I was never a confrontational or straightforward kid.     
     
After that I moved off to college and never saw Sausage in person again. She’s still on my Facebook, though. It has been ten years. She’s gotten married and divorced, had one kid, and ballooned up to twice the woman she was in high school. She’s forever fashion conscious, but without the self-consciousness it takes to pull it off. And always three sizes too small. ",Pressing the Issue

fatpeoplestories,"Guys. I just-

After having lost 20kg (and losing more!), I am a completely self-certified shitlord and almost-former fattie.

I’m also happy to report that most of my family, excluding my dad and second brother, is very health-conscious. Note that we all used to be obese and/or overweight. And well, even my dad is kinda getting there - almost being in his 60s now, he’s still quite stubborn about certain things. But even *he* has lost a good amount of weight.

So it pains me, it *pains* me, to see that my second brother (we will call him FatBro) is just getting bigger and bigger. It’s like he exhaled the rest of the food my family used to consume.

He just got married. During the period before one’s marriage, people do try to watch their weight in order to look their best for the photos.

Him and his new wife (SIL) put weight on. 

Now, at least SIL made her own wedding dress (she’s terribly talented), but of course FatBro had to custom make his tux.

I’m usually out on the weekends, since my busy job means I only have time for chill sessions with friends at the end of the week. When I come home, and/or on Sunday mornings, I see the fridge stuffed with pizza boxes.

It. Just. Pains. Me.

Today, the doorbell is ringing non-stop. I finally go and answer it even though I’m in the middle of something. A pizza guy appears with 3 big boxes and 2 smaller boxes

Guys.

They ordered 3 pizzas for two of them. FatBro and SIL. TWO PEOPLE ordered THREE PIZZAS.

I literally smirk when I saw the pizza guy. I am just FLOORED that they’re managing to eat so much. For two people. 3 pizzas and the rest of the snacks they got.

How is that possible? 

I come from an Asian country where the overweight are not treated well. I have seen both sides of the coin, having been a big size and being much smaller now. I cannot imagine wanting to ever go back to being that big again.

I am honestly so worried for FatBro because he is eating his life away. When I made a snide comment about them getting 3 pizzas he basically told me to fuck off. Okay, enjoy your slow death then, bro.

SIL is also getting bigger and bigger. She has put on about 5-6kg since having met FatBro about 2 years ago. My grandma once mistook me for her.

Okay, that’s basically it. I just cannot stand that my brother thinks it’s okay to have that much pizza on a weekly basis. It’s completely ridiculous! On one hand, I am so done with expressing my concern (in a nice and non-snarky manner I promise) to him. On the other hand, he’s my brother and I don’t want to see him die before he’s 40!","Why can’t my brother see that his diet is killing him, and making his new wife virtually unrecognisable?"
fatpeoplestories,"I have a friend who has struggled with self-esteem issues for years and has always tied happiness directly to her weight and relationship status. She is usually the most darling friend for the most part but tends to get extremely needy in the way where she constantly needs affirmation, but when you give her honest feedback/advice that she endlessly asks for, she makes every excuse in the book why nothing will ever work or change her weight situation no matter how hard she tries. It’s exhausting.

She’s not even that overweight. About 5’8” and 200lbs according to the body gallery. She doesn’t exercise regularly besides twice-monthly belly dancing lessons. She’s the type who pretends to eat very little in front of people but I know for a fact behind closed doors she eats a LOT of junk. (We used to share a house and yeah... all the junk food and fast food wrappers stashed around everywhere was the giveaway.)

I’m a pretty serious runner. I stick to a very strict diet and workout regimen and it’s hard work, but very rewarding hard work. Today, she once again dismissed all my commitment and discipline to my sport by complaining about how “easy” it is for me because of my “genes” to look so fit. 

I hate how she does this, and I try to gently remind her that I look the way I do because I work hard at being a dedicated runner. Yet her reply today was, “Whatever. It’s easy for skinny people with good genes like you to say that when you’d still look fit even if you stop exercising completely.” 

And then the vicious cycle continues with her claiming that her genetic predisposition for being fat (regardless of how much she “constantly exercises and starves” herself) being why she can’t keep a boyfriend when really her incessant neediness is what drives every guy away. 

I really needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for letting me vent, Reddit.

fatpeoplestories,"Hello to all of my adopted FPS little siblings! I just had a brief encounter with some fatlogic at work, so I got a story for you. 

**Brief character intro &amp; background**

&gt;OP: Fit &amp; definitely skinnier than the average American

&gt;CW: Coworker &amp; friend outside of work. Also fit (like, her muscles have muscles fit) and athletic-looking

&gt;NTL: Needs to lose; chubby coworker who's a few pounds overweight

Feel free to skip this part. My company is pretty great. It has a fully stocked kitchen, pays for our lunches, and we get snacks prepared for us every afternoon. So there's always food; most of it's pretty unhealthy, but there are also a lot of healthy options to choose from. But it takes a lot of self control to not overeat, and a ton of coworkers complain about gaining the ""*Company Name* 15."" 

**Story time!**

So CW is in the break room with NTL talking about her recent 30 day challenge. CW is super into health and fitness, so she does a few of these a year. When I sit down to join them, CW just finishes saying how she ended up losing a bit of body fat and weight from her last challenge and how happy she was with the results. 

NTL: I need to lose weight. My doctor says I'm 10 pounds overweight, so I'd like to lose 15 pounds.

CW: Well, diet and exercise will definitely help.

OP: Seriously, you could lose that in less than 2 months easily. 

NTL: But I've been trying to lose weight for a while, but I can't seem to. I've been doing exercises on my Wii and I walk around the office all day, so I should be losing weight!

CW: You're probably eating too much. 

NTL: I don't each much at all! I'm way too busy during the day to eat anything because I'm always running around the office and don't sit down a lot, but I can't seem to lose anything!

*She's the office admin and have offices in 2 buildings, so she definitely does do a lot of moving during the day. But I see her snacking around the office all the time, and she's currently snacking on a bag of chips and candy*

OP: If you're not losing weight, then you're eating more food than you should. 

NTL: But I'm exercising on my Wii and walking around!

CW: Yeah, but you don't lose weight from exercise. You lose it from dieting.

OP: Plus it's easy to lose track of how much you eat during the day if you're always busy. You're probably eating a lot more than you think.

NTL: I heard that you're supposed to eat a big breakfast and then very small meals the rest of the day to lose weight. I'm going to try that.

CW: Or you could just do smaller meals throughout the day so you're not hungry?

NTL: But I don't have time to eat during the day, so I get hungry when I get home and eat a lot!

OP: There are times throughout the day when you're sitting at your desk for at least a few minutes. That's enough time to eat an apple or carrot sticks. And I know your boss forces you to take your lunch break, so there's no excuse to not grab a salad or something next door and eat it during your break.

CW: And you should probably start tracking everything you eat. There's some apps that make it easy like MyFitnessPal. You just have to make sure you're being accurate when you put in the amount of food you're eating, because it's easy to say that you're only eating one serving of something when you've really eaten more than that.

NTL: That sounds so complicated. I'm so jealous. You two don't have to do much of anything and you lose weight! 

OP: I actually do a lot to maintain my weight. I go out of my way to eat healthy and filling foods, exercise regularly, and I weigh myself once a week to make sure I'm staying consistent. If I know I have an event coming up where I'll eat a ton, like a holiday or vacation, I cut way back on the amount of food I eat a few days before and afterwards to make sure I don't gain too much weight. But since I'm hypoglycemic I have to do even more work and planning to make sure my glucose levels don't drop. 

CW: And I plan most of my meals for every week on Sundays and work out at least once a day. Plus my gym has 30 day challenges a few times a year that I do that take up a lot of time and aren't easy to stick with. 

NTL: Ok, I guess I can give it a try, but I have chubby genes so I don't know if it'll work. 

*Break ends, and the office slaves go back to work (all except for OP who goes back to Reddit because it's Friday afternoon and almost quitting time anyway, plus she worked late every day all week so she deserves the break, dammit!*

So I don't know if NTL is actually going to make an effort. She's been talking about needing to lose weight for a few years and a lot of people have been giving her pretty good advice on how to do it that she seems to ignore. She did download MFP on her phone, though, so hopefully she gives it a go. 

*OP feels a rant coming on, so she grabs her handy dandy portable soap box and stands on top of it*

Personally it really frustrates me when other people tell me how easy it is for *me* to stay skinny, as if I lucked out and the laws of physics just work differently for me. It takes a bit of an effort to make healthy choices, especially in a world where junk food is everywhere. Plus I spend most of my working days sitting on my butt in front of a computer, so I often force myself to work standing up, take the stairs instead of the elevator, and go to the gym when I'd rather sit on my butt watching TV with my husband. 

I get it, it's hard to make a lifestyle change. We get busy and can't cook a healthy dinner, so we order pizza. Work gets stressful and the last thing we want to do is go for a run or lift weights. But if you don't care enough to do your research, eat healthier, spend the time planning meals, and forcing yourself to be more active, then don't complain that you can't lose weight. And don't bitch about how easy it is for people like me to be ""skinny"" because believe me, I work for this body. 

*OP steps down, folds up soapbox, curls into a ball and rolls away into the sunset*

fatpeoplestories,"Previously, in the adventures of Thickette: Thickette made fun of me for my weight, told me I was too skinny to be raped, and quite possibly ate Sweden.

&amp;nbsp;

Me: 16, female. Approximately 5'3 and 93 lbs. That may sound bad, but I've been to several of doctors and they've all said I'm not too skinny.

&amp;nbsp;

Thickette: A friend of a friend. Also 16 and female. 5'4. Says she's 200 lbs, but I would guess she's more. Always refers to herself as ""thick."" She's also bisexual, which is important in this story.

&amp;nbsp;

Eyeliner: my close friend, also friends with Thickette. Maybe 5'4 and 160, but she carries her weight well. She also has a pretty face, a nice personality, and knows how calories work. A very femme lesbian. 

&amp;nbsp;

Blackbelt: ex-bff of Thickette. Possibly even more petite than me. She's a very sweet person who wouldn't hurt a fly, but she also has a black belt in taekwondo or something. 

&amp;nbsp;

Prologue: Shortly after my last story happened, I was talking to Eyeliner. Thickette came up behind her from out of no where and grabbed her ass. Eyeliner lost it, and started shouting and Thickette. Apparently, Thickette had done this several times before. Eyeliner is now angry at Thickette. Thickette also stopped being best friends with Blackbelt, and said it was because Blackbelt wouldn't stop hitting her. I doubted it but didn't say anything. Now Thickette has even fewer friends.

&amp;nbsp;

Please be warned, this isn't really a funny story. It's mostly just sad. I walked into school to heard Thickette calling my name. I didn't really want to talk to her, but I walk over to her anyway. She was sitting on the floor, looking sad. She looked up at me and says, ""I feel like I've been mean to you. I'm really sorry. I'm just so stressed out all of the time, and I take it out on you."" I was shocked, has Thickette become self aware? 

&amp;nbsp;

She continued: ""Spanish class is really stressing me out. I don't get why we have to learn that stupid language anyway. Why can't everyone just speak English? It would be much easier that way."" I was almost revealed to hear that she's just as self centered as ever.

&amp;nbsp;

We sat in silence for a minute. Randomly, she says, ""Life has no meaning you know."" It was 7 am, and I was not in the mood for philosophy. I just sort of stared at her. She said, ""I don't get why people try so hard to live so long. What's the point? Once you get old, you need other people to take care of you. That means you're not contributing anything to society. You're just a burden. They should just let you die. That's why I don't wanna live past 60.""

&amp;nbsp;

I was speechless. It seemed such a sad and bitter view to take, and I started to feel bad for her. I said something like ""disabled people and babies can't take care of themselves. Should we let them die?"" She said no to killing babies and yes to ""euthanizing"" disabled people. I told her she sounded like a Nazi.

&amp;nbsp;

She then told me that she wants to be euthanized after age 60, because ""it's just not normal to live longer than that."" I silently decided to report her to my school's crisis line. Then I told her I was pretty sure that they don't euthanize people who aren't dying from a terminal illness. ""I'll make sure to give myself diabetes, then,"" she said. She looked at the Oreo's I had started to stress eat. ""If I ate one of those Oreo's, I'd automatically get type 2 diabetes. You're lucky to eat whatever you want."" I figured out, then, that Thickette probably knew her eating habits would kill her and was just trying to justify dying early to herself. I felt very sad.

&amp;nbsp;

I didn't really talk to Thickette for the rest of the day. I asked my friends if they had noticed her being weird, but they said that's just how she is and they don't really talk to her anymore. Eyeliner said it's because Thickette kept grabbing her ass, some other people said Thickette is just mean. I asked Blackbelt why she isn't friends with Thickette, saying, ""Thickette told me you were always hitting her."" Blackbelt said she never hit anyone, she just got creeped out by Thickette angrily and jealously texting her in the middle of the night. Turns out Thickette may have a bit of a Nice Guy streak.

&amp;nbsp;

I've reported Thickette to the crisis line though, so hopefully my school officials will find her someone to talk to. ",Thickette and nihilism

—————

So, as my school continued with Hunney and Pooh, I increasingly began to see why they were considered the “outsiders” of our small school. Our class was only 120 people, so it was fairly small compared to most high schools . We all got to know each other really, really well. 

Hunney, Pooh, and a friend of mine (Tigger) are all big fans of pop culture and whatnot, including some anime. Tigger and I both set out on a journey to learn some Japanese and Chinese, as her parents were both of those origins (Tokyo and Hong Kong). I got to know her and her family very well, and was even invited to celebrate some events with them, like Himamatsuri or Chinese New Year. Additionally, they were quite Christian, and Tigger invited me often to the church cafe to study pretty often. 

This didn’t sit well with Hunney or Pooh at all. For one thing, Hunney was Jewish, and got frustrated when Tigger “flaunted” her religion in front of her, such as when she wore her cross necklace or listened to Christian rock. Additionally, they had tried to ask her for Japanese things from her mom, and she’d refused in the past. The fact that she was doing those things with the new girl seemed to really piss them off, to the point of when instead of asking politely to copy down work from my paper in biology (they hated to do their own work in that class, as it seems), they’d just simply take it and copy when I’d get up to do something. Yet, I was still their friend? Yeah, I don’t get it either.

It seems to have been the end of the line when for International Day, Tigger wore a beautiful Furisode, and she gave me a lovely Komon Kimono which looked super similar to [This](http://www.japanya.co.uk/japanese-nobles-kimono-turquoise/152130.aspx). Now here’s the moment I wasn’t prepared for. Hunney ogled us a bit when we walked in together for Homeroom, and started gushing about how we looked like we were right from an anime, etc. It was with good intention, but I really didn’t feel comfortable with the whole ordeal, as she clung to us (maybe to act cute? Rip our clothes? Feed off our souls? Who knows.) and pulled the both of us down. Now Pooh, she didn’t like this one bit, nosiree. She confronted Tigger about this, and she coolly replied with “Pooh, I’ve told you before, I have nothing that’d remotely fit you from my Japanese or Chinese clothes. Rabbit’s only wearing them because my mom insisted, and they fit her well.”

“Well, they make clothes for people who are curvier, right? You know, bigger girls use to be what was considered attractive!”

We understood that she wasn’t feeling the most secure, but the next part really threw us off kilter. 

_ “It’s like with unshaven pubes, they’re making a comeback you know!”_

_Ooookay Pooh why the hell did you scream that in homeroom?_ Tigger was irritated as fuck (she took no shit, one of the toughest girls I know still today), and I just found a chair and slunk down into it the best I could. Or, at least I wanted to, my Obi prevented me from doing that well. Hunney sensed her friend wasn’t in the best of moods, and placated her with some of the international food that had been brought in (I remember distinctly what it was; Baklava.) She seemed to have gotten over her little outburst, but it stuck with me the rest of the day. 

During the parade, she was hanging out nearby Tigger and me, and she came over and pinched my butt through the kimono. I eeped a little, and jumped. I nearly fell down onto the pavement with my zori sandals, and those little guys are not only delicate, but expensive af. After I recoordinated myself, I figured it’d just been an accident or a lecherous boy, but no. It was her, and the only reason I know this is because apparently Tigger overhead some comment in the passing about making me jump, and mentioned it to me when we were changing out.

After that day, Pooh seemed super fixated on my size. She stressed even more that I should eat more, and accompany her and Hunney to the Asian supermarket “nearby” her house (it wasn’t close at all, it was about 20 minutes drive away). I have an extreme seafood allergy, and part of that market is an open seafood section, so I avoid it avidly. However, this was chalked up to me “playing it up” and “it wasn’t a big deal, the doctors just want to get money out of me.” Especially the fact that I had to carry an Epipen at all times then also bothered her during lunch, and sometimes she’d ask if she could inject herself “just to see what it was like.” Naturally this is some of the stupidest stuff ever, and at this point I was super frustrated with her actions and how she’d treated me, I mean, whats the point of teasing them for being small? That’s just out of their control, insensitive, and above all, completely rude and unnecessary.

I saw that her blatant disregard for medical conditions expanded to many others. She frowned down at another classmate that took insulin frequently, and even mocked another classmate who had severe asthma and carried his inhaler around. “I have asthma too, and I don’t need to do that! They’re just doing it for attention Rabbit, _I swear.”_

She claimed that she was just _“keeping it real”_ and _“telling it how it is,”_ and that apparently gave her a pass for being a jerk. Well, I soon learned where all of it came from when she invited me to her birthday party. She gave me the invitation informally, and some begging and pleading, Kanga allowed me to go until 10:30 PM, a compromise from the proposed sleepover Pooh had wanted Hunney, Tigger, and a few others to participate in. 

Kanga and Owl were not happy at all about my attendance there, but in an effort to give her the benefit of the doubt, as well as not to look rude, they dropped me off with a present in hand and keeping their worries and doubts in sealed lips. And boy, was I happy that they were so suspicious for once. 

The house itself was pretty unassuming, if not a little run down, from the outside. Now, I have absolutely nothing against houses of any sort, as I’ve lived in a variety of them myself. However, one thing we strive and value the most for, no matter the place, is cleanliness and hospitality. I foolishly assumed that they had some semblance of the standard that I’d been raised with, and that went right out of the window.

They did not have a proper door on the side of their house, it was more of a wooden baby gate, and a screen door with some rough processed wood on the inside. I stepped inside, and was immediately hit with the smell of animal. Not the good kind, but everything that comes out one. Cat pee, dog poop, bird feathers, everything that I have marked “high” on my allergy charts, I could feel seeping into my skin. Not once had she mentioned she had dogs, birds, hamsters, whatever else was there. I probably saw a couple large Texan cockroaches in there too, but I’m sure I would have run all the way home if I really processed what all was around me.

That’s not the worst of it. This house, amidst its dank and wet animal smells, and outdated, breaking decor, was the most unorganized mess of a building I’d ever seen in my life. Clothes, piles of bits and bobs, papers, baskets, trinkets, etc. lined the walls and piled on couches and even more so as we ventured into the “office” to get her computer, and I had no interest in going into any other rooms. She mentioned that she didn’t like anyone in her because “I have to take soooo many medicines because of my medical conditions! It’s superrr embarrassing to have people see them, and they usually pity me when they see it. I don’t want you guys to see me any differently.” A little dramatic, but I suppose I’ll let that slide.

I gave her my present and put on my best gameface, only to see her in a croptop that’d gone far beyond its use, and a pair of sweatpants that I’m pretty sure fit her until recently, but was very unflattering for her body type. Or just, body in general. I thought her hair was freshly washed, but no. I later learned that it was actually oil, when she complained about how she was out of dry shampoo and having to go without it whilst locking up 6 big dogs they were fostering in another room, with yet _another_ babygate only to block them. This become important later.

Hunney arrived, and surprisingly, in just as unflattering of clothing. I honestly felt out of place, since I’d picked a nice blouse and leggings to wear, I’d even put on some light jewelry. When Tigger arrived, she’d had worn something similar, so it was relief to not be the only one. However, nothing could have prepared me for her mother, who from here on out will be called “Heffalump.”

Heffalump was, and still is to this day, the largest woman I’d ever seen in my life. She had a face that I can only describe as sunken in due to the fat, and walked with a cane. She’d made her debut to us when she’d come out and plopped onto the whole loveseat, and announced her presence proudly.

“I’m Pooh’s mom, Heffalump! You’ll have to forgive my husband, he’s not quite good with guests, especially younger girls, so he’ll be in the office for tonight! _huehuehue_”Though I understood what she was getting at, the way she said it still could be totally taken the wrong way, I mean, was it necessary to laugh? It makes me shiver a little just to think about it. 

We had some friendly conversation among all of us, but apparently Tigger and I discussing something that she likes without her there is “unacceptable” and we’ve gotta include her. Her mom didn’t bat an eye at her behavior, and honestly it was at that moment that I wanted to pick up all I had and leave. The house, the allergic reaction that was forming in my throat, these people who were so far from what I know to be normal from my circle, I was overwhelmed! Some time passed, and it was obvious we’d be the only ones there, and we tried to entertain ourselves by playing cards, since many of the games we’d otherwise suggested require some sort of space or capacity for physical activity.

Then came the cake. The cake was huge, and it seems like it was ordered from a Korean bakery, since it was light, fluffy, and topped with fruits. I was quite shocked honestly, and had expected something a bit more on the heavy or grotesquely unhealthy side. But, as if God himself heard my thoughts and chuckled, Pooh promptly slid away all the fruits, and helped herself to a huge slice, accompanied with some doughnuts from earlier, and a nice stack of chips, cookies, and...frosting? Yep. Just straight up frosting.

Pooh saw my facial expression, and jumped to her own defense, saying she hated the whipping cream on the cake, and preferred to have “real sugar” instead of “that fake sugar.” Uhh.....what are you saying girl?

Heffalump backed her up. Smiling at her, and announcing that she’d made the right decision, and although she was “breaking her diet, this little sweet treat shouldn’t affect her too badly.” After all, it was her birthday. What happened next though, certainly wasn’t a present. Heffalump struggled for a few minutes to get up, and when she did, she turned around and tried to shimmy out between the coffee table and couch. However, her bum was out so much, it caressed the side of the cake, and left a nice big white smear of white whip all across her pant bottom. 

Nobody really knew what to say, because she was, pardon my crudeness, literally waddling to the kitchen like a child in an inflatable ring, with her bum jiggling and the whip rippling in the ocean of bottom fat. How it was brought to her attention though, I’ll never forget. One of their foster dogs saw what it was and zoomed straight over to her, nearly knocking down a couple piles of stuff in the process and breaking part of the babygate, and started ferociously licking the frosting off of her bottom. 

It seemed so surreal, since it happened so quickly, and soon the others followed and it evolved into 6 big dogs all excited, smelling sugar, and barking so loud that I’m sure the moon (or the rest of the neighborhood) could hear them. Pooh tried frantically to get the dogs outside, and Hunney helped fix the mess they’d made in the chaos of it all. They’d knocked over a couple piles of papers, which’d gotten on our foods and the surrounding area. Tigger and I silently threw away our affected foods, and helped clean up as much as we could before calling in early. My allergies were also quite visibly affecting my speech and breathing, and without any antihistamine in their house, I desperately needed a dust/dander/human free environment. 

And so, there was Pooh’s 18th birthday party.

fatpeoplestories,"We made our final pit stop.  Gula, perhaps realizing that she was the only one not wearing a camp shirt, asked to borrow one of the shirts out of my bag.  First, she’s a person who had just proven to the entire bus that she shits herself with such force and regularity that she must carry a change of clothes, an entire outfit, in her purse.  Second, I tailor my shirts because anything that fits me in the shoulders hangs like a muumuu by the time it reaches my waist.  Gula, while she isn’t extraordinarily heavy, has a very unfortunate distribution of fat:  that is; she carries her extra weight very poorly.  Before she went away to school, she was mostly unremarkable:  everything was in the proper place; nothing was too small or too large; and when she had to get dressed up, she was actually quite pretty.  After a year at university, she has a body like the Grimace—she is a perfect pear.  She has grown a gut that hangs down not only her front, but also her sides and back as well.  Her breasts have lost any semblance of structure; they now look like two deflated balloons that lazily flop off of a roll of chest fat.  She has no ass and legs much smaller than you would expect for someone with her upper body.   So I told her she was dressed fine, and that she didn’t need to use one of my shirts.  

At the clinic, I got everyone checked in, then drove the bus closer to the block of dorm rooms assigned to our group.  Gula was lucky enough to be assigned to a handicap room of the women’s dormitory.  I got busy moving her mass of groceries into her room while surreptitiously searching for any errant bottles of alcohol.  One of the students operated the lift for her.  I made sure everyone had everything off the bus and I was about to leave when I saw Gula’s newest outfit.  

She sat in her stolen wheelchair with her (possibly stolen) cane by her side.  She wore tiny pair of cutoff shorts; they were so short, her pockets were sticking out.  When I beheld her naked midriff, I thought she was wearing a sports bra, but the garment had sleeves.  She must have caught me trying to figure out her clothing when she said, “Don’t worry, I’ll throw it in the dryer before I give it back.”  At that, I realized she was wearing one of my shirts, but she couldn’t get it to fit over her belly.  I couldn’t give less of a shit if she wanted to look ridiculous, so I just left for my hotel.  

**Later That Night**  

Because I had to pick-up a group that was returning from a different clinic the next day, the camp gave me a small per diem for a hotel room and the night off.  I pocketed the money, paid for a room at a nicer hotel, and found a date.  

At about ten o’clock, my date, Andy, and I were just getting back to my room when I got a phone call from a local number; I ignored it.  Half-an-hour later, we were quite well into making out, when I got a call from Gula.  She was blubbering and clearly drunk; I was angry that I hadn’t found all of her booze, but I hung up and ignored the call.  A little before eleven:  some things were lubed, others were sheathed; Andy and I were ready to go when I got a call from Coach.  I had an internal debate about picking up, but he wouldn’t be calling, or even awake, at this hour unless it was something important.  

“You have to pick her up,” he said.  

He didn’t even have to use her name, I knew who.  “So, like nine o’clock is fine?” I asked.  

“No, as soon you can,” came his reply.  

“So, like six?” I said, hoping he didn’t mean what I knew he meant.  

“Like now.  Get out of bed, pick her ass up, and let her sleep on your couch.” was Coach’s irritated reply.  

I gave Coach a brief synopsis of my present situation.  He set about getting a room at the same hotel online.  I set about getting dressed and explaining Gula to Andy.  Andy, incredulous that such a person could exist, offered to drive.  I was able to check Gula in before we left.  

**Behold the Gula-Monster**  

The entire ride over, I was regaling Andy with Gula’s various exploits from earlier in the summer.  When we pulled up, she was sitting outside in her stolen wheelchair eating from a pizza box and drinking from a gallon jug of fruit punch.  She wore what looked like a sequined wife beater—it was actually a very short dress.  I got out of the car, took two steps, and was doubled over in pain.  I had the worst case of blue balls I’ve ever had.  The pain caused me to become angrier.  

One of the clinicians came outside.  “Are you Jim?” He asked, clearly peeved but civil.  I answered in the affirmative.  “She,” pointing to Gula, “needs to go, now.”  

A drunk Gula piped up, “You been saying that for an hour.  Ain’t shit happened yet.”  I pushed Gula’s chair over to Andy’s car.  She jerked her chair so that she was facing the man.  Balancing her pizza and fruit punch, she spread her legs and pulled up her skirt, “You just mad I ain’t let you get none of this.”  Thank God she was wearing underwear, bright red underwear, but … small blessings.  The man walked back inside as I kept shouting, “Sorry,” over and over again.  

Andy, who had been a passive observer to this spectacle, got out to help me load Gula.  “No food in the car, please,” said Andy.  At this, Gula stacked the remaining four slices and ate them all at once.  “No drinks either.”  

Gula looked up at Andy, the anger evident on her face, “I CAN’T finish my drink.”  

This was the first time he had to deal with Gula, “You can pour it out then.”  

Gula looked him in the eye and began chugging the fruit punch.  “I can’t drink anymore or I’ll die.  You want me to die?”  

“It’s a toss-up right now,” Andy shot back.  

I took the bottle from Gula, and sniffed.  It was strongly alcoholic, so I poured it out in front of her.  She leapt out of her chair but by the time she reached me it was all gone.  “That was mine, why’d you do that.  You owe me for that.”  

I was angry that my date had been interrupted, I was angry that I was in pain, and I was angry that I had to deal with a non-compliant Gula.  I lost my temper and began shouting at her, I didn’t even bother using English.  From my tone, she got the point and scurried back to the car.  Andy put her chair in the trunk.  

Once we were all inside he looked at her in the rearview mirror, “Even on a pretty girl, that dress would be trashy.”  And he drove back to the hotel.  

Back at the hotel, I dumped Gula and her chair in her room.  She instinctively went to check out the fridge, “Why’d you lock the fridge?”  

“It’s a minibar.  Stay away from it.  Just go to sleep,” I said.  She went over and collapsed on the bed.  I was seriously considering tying her to the bed.  But I left her passed out and rejoined Andy.  

**The Next Morning**  

It was mid-morning, Andy had left and I went to check on Gula.  I had trouble pushing her door open—never a good sign.  The room smelled of vomit, stale beer, and a general funk that I have yet to identify.  Candy and snack wrappers were strewn across the floor.  A chair was missing one its legs.  Beer cans, wine coolers, and bottles of pop were covering the night stand.  I turned around to find that Gula had used the chair leg to pry open the minibar.   

I saw Gula in bed, her dress from last night was now covered in red vomit and resting on one of the lamps.  “Gula, get up,” I practically shouted.  

Groggily she looked up and saw me, “Why you peeping on me?”  I told her we had to go.  “Can’t you see my dress is ruined?  I ain’t got nothing to wear.”   I told her I would bring her a change of clothes after I picked up the campers from the other clinic.  “Well if you ain’t got no more business here, I guess you can get the fuck out.”  So I left.  

**Later That Morning**  

We pulled up to the hotel.  Amy, the counselor who had gone with our campers to the gymnastics clinic, had been informed *that* she would be taking Gula’s place at the track and field clinic, but not *why* she would be doing so.  I sent her up to Gula’s room with some clothes.  Amy didn’t have much experience with Gula, so this would be a crash course for her.  

Amy returned to the bus and pulled me aside, “that room is destroyed.”  I nodded knowingly.  “She’s just lounging around in the nude up there.”  Another silent nod from me.  “Why does she have a wheelchair?”  

Only then did I realize that Amy had been absent for the entirety of Gula’s wheelchair saga.  Before I could get her completely filled in, Gula came down looking like some poor, pitiful victim of a terrible disease.  Amy and I knew she was just nursing a hangover.  The campers however took pity on her, and treated her like she was ill.  

Having dropped Amy off at the track and field clinic, we began our trip back to camp.  

**On the Road Again**  

About an hour into the journey, Gula managed to whine, “I need to eat.”  

“You can eat when we stop for fuel.”  Some of the campers, who were unaware Gula’s true state, protested on her behalf.  To shut everyone up, I turned off the interstate.  I don’t know if she was googling restaurant locations, but I suspect she was.  Our only options were a Golden Corral or some fast food places several miles down the road.  We ended up at the buffet.  *What followed was a master class in Gula's fatlogic.*

**TL/DNR:**  Gula gets kicked out of a clinic after less than half of a day, ruins my night, then ruins her hotel room.

I hope this is ok, I was just curious if anyone might recall a particular series where there's a ham planet who asks to take pills the OPs friend takes because she thinks it will either make her lose weight, or will make her special because now she is valid in her condushuns and then she poops herself? And then they have to take her back to the apartments in the back of a truck with a beloved dracula cape taking the full brunt of her poopy wares...It's been so long it's hard to remember details.

fatpeoplestories,"Every day at work, I have lunch with my colleagues. There is a range of ages, evenly spread from early 20s through to late 60s, and about half and half men and women. Some are from wealthy backgrounds, others economically challenged. Nearly everyone is a normal weight. 

However. Every day at lunch, fatlogic spews from a lot of maws. 

- Carbs are satan, so are fats.
- Dairy and gluten make you fat.
- Exercise is for losing weight, no other reason.
- Whenever you eat junk food, you must immediately tell everyone in the vicinity that ""I dont ever eat like this teehee"" 
- There must always be cakes and biscuits, and if you dont eat them it means you're anorexic.
- If you do eat biscuits, you're a disgusting slob (unless you first announce ""I never eat like this teehee"")
- No one has any idea how calories work
- Lifting weights and muscle mass on women is disgusting, even if the alternative is looking like a skinny naked Zoidberg without your shapewear on.

Is it any wonder some people get obese when even ""normal"" weight folks have no idea how food and exercise works?

fatpeoplestories,"Hey y'all, I'm a type one diabetic, healthy height and weight but just had an incident that reminded me of a time where I didn't give a shit about my blood sugar and why it makes sense that fat, type 2 diabetics are obsessed with them. Well in high school, I went through a period where my blood sugar was constantly skyrocketed (really bad I know, I'm still trying to get my A1c under control 3 years later) and was in the high 200s to 300s almost consistently. The first time I got down to a normal range after like a month of this bullshit (like 120 or something actually healthy) I legit did feel like I was having a hypoglycemic attack. I was shaking, dizzy, thought I was gonna pass out... BUT here's the catch. It's called rational thinking, impossible nowadays I know, especially with fat logic. The numbers don't fucking lie, and no matter how shitty someone feels, if your blood sugar is good it's good and you do NOT need food. It'll feel like shit for a bit but the only reason it feels so bad to be at a healthy blood sugar is because the body has now become quite accustomed to having excess sugars in the blood stream. So yes, a hamplanet with a blood sugar of even 200 may feel like they're going to pass out or die or whatever, but that's only because they're probably in the 400-500s consistently and 200 is ""low"" for what their bodies are used to. So I guess just knowing that the facts don't lie is the only way out... unfortunately that doesn't seem to be too commonplace with those who have terribly high blood sugars with type 2 diabetes.","Understand the ""shugahs"" problem."
fatpeoplestories,"So... flying this evening from east coast to west coast. Due to my work I often sit in first class which is where I am at now. I noticed there was a rather large passenger sitting diagonally behind me. I marveled that he barely fit in the first class seat with his girth actually touching the seat in front of him. I noticed his window seat mate before we even took off was holding a blanket to his nose and face. I figured he must be sleepy. 

At some point during the flight my seat mate needed to use the rest room and the huge guy (he is about ready for Dr. Now if he is not already at that size) was standing up waiting to go to the bathroom as his seat mate was in the restroom for a long while. 

That is when the odor started becoming extremely noticeable. Think old stale urine, dirty ass smell, strong BO, with an underlying fecal odor. Once the guy was in my air space I can’t get rid of the odor. I concocted a burka out of my blanket and when that didn’t help I went to the flight attendant for some lemons to rub on my hands and nose. She sympathized. 

Meanwhile the huge guys seat mate had come out of the bathroom and asked for more plastic bags so he could well.... stand up at the door and be ready for another round of vomiting. 

Unfortunately the pilots had to use the bathroom so the poor seat mate had to go sit down which meant I got the glory of the full ass of the huge guy in my face while he struggled to let the guy back in.

fatpeoplestories,"I'm an average-sized woman (5'6"", 138 pounds), but for some reason I have unusually large wrists (6.8 inches circumference). Maybe it's because I played softball, tennis, and gymnastics when I was younger, all sports that develop wrist strength. I don't know. Anyway, this means that most ""normal"" ladies' bracelets don't fit me, and I have to either wear men's bracelets, or buy ones tailored for ""plus size"" women. Now I actually like some of the leather men's bracelets that are really more unisex than anything, but this story is about what happened when I went to a ""plus size"" retailer to buy one that was a little more feminine.

Let's call this store Jane Tryant. I walk in and am greeted by a medium-sized planet about my height but probably 230 - 240 pounds. She looks me up and down and then, in this weird voice that's kind of hard to describe (maybe a police matron from a 1960s movie talking to a female inmate) says, ""Can I help you find something?""

I tell her I'm looking for a bracelet and she points me to the jewelry section. No further questions on what style or anything, which is no biggie because typically I like to browse by myself. I pick out a bracelet that I like and take it to the cashier, who is a 5'2""/180 lbs. moon. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see Planet staring at me from across the room.

Moon looks me up and down in the same way that Planet did. ""This going to be all?""

""Yes,"" I say. I feel a little awkward, but try to smile.

As she's handing me my change, Moon says, ""Does it feel good for a woman like you, coming here?""

Huh?

""Why are you here? Do you need to validate yourself by looking at the clothes here and telling yourself that you're too small for all of them?""

Um, no. I didn't even look at the clothes. I try to explain about the bracelets and how the normal ones don't fit me.

Moon's expression changes, as if she almost regrets something she said, but then she comes back with, ""Well, a woman having big wrists isn't stigmatized in the same way that muh curves are.""

By now, I'm getting a little annoyed, and I say, ""First of all, I'm just here to shop, not get into a discussion about politics or your struggles in life, whether real or imagined. And second, I have received snarky comments about my wrist size."" (An ex-boyfriend once told me I had arms like a man because my wrists were bigger than his. I told him maybe he had arms like a girl and...well, that's why he's my ex).

fatpeoplestories,"I am disabled and use forearm crutches to assist with my mobility.  I also have a care assistant who helps me with some daily tasks, today our mission was to do some shopping at walmart.  My carer pushes the cart while I walk along searching for items and sometimes helping put them in the cart.

When suddenly a rumbling of a  motorized cart begging for mercy under the weight that it was clearly not made to hold.  She is massive, her belly hangs down over her knees and her side rolls come out along the sides so that they brush against shelves, as she rumbles past us her wheels catch on the edge of my crutches and I stumble and fall, my carer quickly moves to help me up and the ham turns to my carer, ignoring the fact that she is clearly busy making sure I'm not injured before we continue.

The monster, her jowls jiggling as she points her greasy sausage finger first at the carer, then at the soda on the top shelf.  ""Get me that, it's your job to assist the disabled is it not?""

My carer takes no shit, she actually does not even address her, just pushed the cart and we move about on our way.  The ham is shouting after us,  but I guess some poor underpaid store employee got her the beetus juice.

This happens 2 more times, she runs into my once and another time she knocks me down.  She never even acknowledged I exist just zones in on telling my carer off for not helping her and demanding that she get her something or the other from an aisle she just passed because she is ""running late for a doctor's appointment and needs to hurry up.""

Anyway as we are heading up to the check out this monster comes speeding up and catches on a display that is maybe 8 feet tall or so, it's like a thing with spring gardening tools for kids, little plastic shovels and rakes and cute things such as that.  Anyway the ham gets caught on it again, only this time she doesn't just knock a few things over her scooty puff catches on it and the ....whole....entire....display...crashes down.

And it hits me.  Which the monster yet again chooses to pretend I don't exist and starts yelling at my carer.  

The good news is my carer went to an employee, told her what the monster had been doing throughout the store to us, knocking me down etc and she was made to get up off the cart and waddle her fat ass out of the store, the whole time screaming discrimination and other bullshit. 

A few of the display bits hit me, few bruises here and there but I'm okay, and I was given a good chunk of walmart gift cards, not that I enjoy shopping there or anything.....but that's how it goes I guess.  ",attack of the scooty puff hangry ham monster in walmart
fatpeoplestories,"I work at a US military base in Europe. I'm an American, but I've lived in other European countries for several years, and would say my lifestyle, including eating and fitness habits, have changed for the better since moving to Europe. I'm in a normal BMI range and fitness/health conscious. 

I'd forgotten how food-centric American culture is. Moving to this American base and coming into contact with Fat America is shocking. Just shocking. I'd forgotten how bad it's getting in the US.

Some observations. 
-People in the nearby European town are normal people sized. Once you enter the base, the people are huge. I've seen people upwards of 350 pounds. I wonder if the government paid for two airline tickets to fly them out here. The civilians are the fattest, but even the majority of the soldiers are fat. I'm convinced they wear combat uniforms because they are looser and better hide the fat.

-As you approach the base, you start smelling the stink of fast food. That's because the exchange has a food court that sells only fast food. The semi-healthy option is a European bakery. The exchange only sells junk food. The commissary (a grocery store also well-stocked in junk food) is closed on week-ends. 

-The exchange sells clothing, most of which is plus-sized. In particular the work-out clothes for women starts at size large. 

-I has asked when I moved here if I wanted an extra refrigerator, because the European-style fridges are too small for all the processed, frozen food Americans consumed.

-I met a woman who is about to go back to the states after several years. When asked what she was homesick for, she rattled off a list of fast food restaurants. She was fat. 

-During the welcome training, chocolate was regularly handed out. Plates of candy and junk food are usually placed on office counters and tables, including the bank (!), where I saw a woman hand her two-year-old daughter a cupcake and a bag of chips. 

-People graze all day long in their offices. Office trashcans are all full with junk food wrappers. Once a day, a lady comes by with a huge trash bag and collects it all. People also eat in their offices staring at their computer screens. 

I'm sure there are other things, but this is what I can come up with off the top of my head. This move has made realize how insidious fat culture is, and how dominant it is in America, even when you're in the middle of Europe.  
 ",Life in a Fat American Enclave
fatpeoplestories,"Hey guys... I have been *busy*, and... yes, *busy*.

I got my diploma (finally), and moved to another flat (again), and got a boyfriend (the poor guy).

And my uncle, Bikefan, commited suicide. 

That story belongs to /r/badpeoplestories (maybe I should move my ass to that subreddit), so I'm going to limit myself to the events that may be considered relevant.

I don't know how this works in another countries, but in mine, after the body's discovery and subsequent necropsy, the corpse is delivered to the family after a lot of bureocracy and an equal ammount of time spended in the waiting room of an hospital. 

Anyhow, after day two of waiting we were given a certain hour of *delivery* and were sent in our way to make arrangements for the wake.

I, as the only handicaped person in the family, was given leeway regarding the ammount of time I wanted to stay in the hospital (not much), and as such, I spent most of my time at home, and didn't see much of the rest of my family. 

That meant that I didn't see Johamna until an hour before the wake.

Bikefan was my favorite uncle, and I was, and still am, a little shellshocked about his sudden death. I guess I expected the rest of my cousins to feel the same way, but it seemed it wasn't to be.

I opened the door, and Johamna saluted me with ""OMG CUZ! You are *soooo skinny*, it seems like you're gonna dissapear one of this days""

I, being the very articulate person I am, answered with the first thing that crossed my mind, wich was ~~unfortunately~~ the truth.

""Actually, I have gained weight..."" well, four pounds are *four pounds*

""Ugh, figures"" here she squezed my shoulders and then hugged me ""At least you have that, because you are not pretty at all"" Thank you, I guess ""Do you have some photos of my uncle? I want to have them"" The *'to publish them on Facebook so I can brag about how very hurt I am'* went unvoiced.

I have to say I didn't expect those levels of saltiness in such a moment, but I guess I should have expected it, since Johamna has reached the point in wich she is a head shorter than me but three times heavier.

I know this is not a particulary good story, but, whilst I was offering her food, I thought maybe it could have place here. Then I forgot about it all for the next four months. 

Today, revisiting that day events, I decided to publish it anyway.

fatpeoplestories,"So, before I begin, I’m on mobile, so I apologize for any spelling/formatting/etc that seems off. 

In this story let’s be: 

Rabbit: Me! 5’1, 120 lb of figure skating muscle. I really don’t look the weight I am, because paired with what I exercised, I also love my fruits and veggies. Very anxious and quiet usually (oops).

Kanga: My mother, ex. Nurse whose huge on healthy eating and proportions. Very critical of fat logic of all types, and does her best to beat all the stereotypes. 

Roo: My younger brother, very concerned with fitness thanks to our fathers experiences in the hospital, goes to the same school as me, Tigger, Pooh, and Huney. 

Owl: My father, an anesthesiologist who works frequently with overweight/obese patients, and has zero tolerance for their bs excuses on eating. A bystander to this event. 

Tigger: My best friend, who despite being on the heavier side, does Black Belt level Karate very frequently, and is working on herself. Very critical of fat logic, but still has huge self esteem issues because of her body shape. [not in this story, but probably in future ones I’ll post!]

DONT BE:

Pooh: A large girl (?) who befriended me and soon exposed me to the onion layers of PC culture, and an avid Tumblrina. The main subject of this particular story. 

Huney: Pooh’s best friend, despite the fact that their families hate each other. She’s similar to me personality wise, but got a huge SJW streak and encouraged the events of this story to occur. 

————

Alright, now that we got all that out of the way, let’s start the story! (This is probably just the intro/part 1):

I’ve moved around a lot in my life, due to my dad (Owl)’s medical education, so I started High School fresh and new, with a crisp uniform and an aura of anxiety. Walking into a biology class where a diagram of phospholipids was front and center, the littlest Rabbit was introduced to the class, and took the sweeping interest of Pooh and Huney. 

They invited me to lunch, and I got to know them. Huney and I hit it off, and I tried to make conversation with Pooh, but she just sort of whispered off tendrils of thoughts she had when Huney and I were talking about god knows what. 

What struck me about Pooh was that she wasn’t wearing the same uniform as everyone else, and I soon learned it was because she had to have alternatives since her size wasn’t carried usually by our uniform provider. That should have set off some thoughts concerning her eating habits, but in a desperate effort to make friends, I stayed by her and Huney in hopes of having a group. 

I learned more about Pooh, and the fact that while she was about 5’7, she was definitely up to nearly 300 lb. She took up two seats at the lunch table, and I eventually started sitting on the other side of the bench. She brought her lunch from home, and it looked like it was multiple meals in one, with the standard crips, cremes, etc. to large amounts of meat and bread. I was amazed she managed to finish it all in our meager lunch period! 

I noticed her eating habits after that, and she always seemed to have something with her, whether it was Cheetos, skittles, pocky, you name it. 

Huney was supportive of this, claiming that since they walked home together, she was getting more than enough exercise, and that would justify her eating. As expected, Pooh did no exercise to even remotely substitute any exercise, and frequently missed gym classes for “periods” and “suspicions of pre-asthma attack conditions”. As someone with asthma myself, I could tell she was perfectly fine, and the only really she was winded was because she kept trying to walk to the gym on campus with her skirt tightened in an effort to look smaller. 

The first introduction I really had to her fat logic though, was in a causal conversation about my dads job. I was explaining that because if someone’s obese, a surgeon is taking on a more risky surgery and therefore can make them a little more nervous and skittish, as opposed to the newly coined “fatphobia.” That’s when I heard it, something I couldn’t believe with my own ears. 

* “Could you please not use such an offensive and discriminatory word? Really Rabbit, I thought you’d know better. * 

I was confused, and thought maybe a swear had slipped in while I was talking, so I apologized quickly and asked what was it that I said. She replied with, accompanied by a look which I can only describe as an imitation of human anger, frustration, and aggression, 

* “The o-word Rabbit. That’s super offensive, and you should be careful. That terms been coined by doctors to oppress people who treat their bodies well, and have learned to enjoy their life!” *

So not only was she into the fatphobia, she was an anti doctor conspirist. _Greatttt._

In my naïvety, tried to argue it until Huney told me it was okay that I was wrong, and I just needed to apologize to Pooh and move on. I did so with a grain of salt, and really began to think about who I really was around. 

Nothing much happened for a while, until she noticed what me and my brother, Roo, ate at home for lunch and dinner. We brought it from home and usually exchanged it with one another, and eventually posed us with “Are y’all okay? You guys seem like you’re sharing only one meal between yourselves. Aren’t you guys suppose to be like, rich?” 

Roo and I are North Indian, we eat daal, flatbreads, yogurts, and masala veggies. It’s usually what we’ve eaten. 

“Well, this is what we usually eat Pooh.”

“It’s okay Rabbit, Huney and I are here if you need to talk about something.”

“What are you talking about?”

“Well, Huney and I think that you’ve been starving yourself lately, and you’ve been purposely avoiding foods, even the ones we give you. Which is why we told the counselor.”

*Wait wait, hold up.*

“The counselor?...about?...”

“Well, we think you have an eating disorder. You’re always seeming to avoid food and only eat Rabbit food. It’s not healthy, and honestly, it’s a real turn off.”

So you’re going to tell me, an aspiring doctor, that eating my veggies and keeping in shape is not only unhealthy, but *unattractive too?* _Nice. Thanks for hitting me with that one. 

I did end up getting called into the counselor, and it turns out that based on what they said, she was heavily concerned that I was actually starving myself. After I explained myself, it turns out that I had also been called in because Pooh complained that she felt “verbally attacked” and was in “a state of mental vulnerability” because of me. What could I possibly have done to cause this? 

That’s right. Using the o-word. Multiple times. Both when I talked to her, and in my bio class. So according to the counselor, I was both her desperate friend in need of some mental help and nourishment, and also someone who seemed to relish in making her and her bestie Huney uncomfy when using a “word that’s been used to systematically shame people like [her].”

This was my first exposure to PC/SJWspeak, and it wouldn’t be the last. She contacted my mother [Kanga] since I didn’t deny the allegations technically, and I admitted to using the word obese in a conversation. 

Kanga was not pleased, and later informed Owl. This will soon be the start of a saga that is riddled with faux tears, lies, and the incredible social blending of fake issues.

fatpeoplestories,"Forgive me if I ramble a bit, I've been at a hospital for more than 16 hours today on less than 2 hours sleep. 

My father had to have spinal surgery today. Specifically he had his L1, L3, L4, L5, and L5-S1 vertebrae fused. The particular procedure they used, the name of which escapes me at the moment, involved opening him up both front and back.

Now we have a personal relationship with this hospital, as well as the majority of the physicians involved in the procedure, due to both our personal and professional lives. Virtually every one of our immediate family has had surgeries performed here, my nephew was born here, my best friend's mother died here, another friend's father received his cancer treatments here. In my professional life I have made multiple deliveries to virtually every doctor involved in the process, have received the access codes to the lab, inpatient and outpatient surgical centers, and inpatient pharmacy of this hospital, and well as having all of the House Supervisors personal numbers saved in my phone.

We know these people, all of them, intimately, except for the thoracic surgeon involved in the front side of the procedure. 

At this hospital, right before anyone has a surgery done (barring an emergency) they meet all of the medical staff involved. This includes every surgeon, every nurse, the anesthesiologists, even the transportation guy who will be moving you to the surgical theater. They all give you the opportunity to to ask any last minute questions while they finish up the necessary documentation. 

The next to the last visitor was my dad's primary surgeon. He spent most of his visit joking about being hung over and needing a Bloody Mary. Ultimately he said one thing that made us laugh, he said, ""Well, I spoke to Dr. XXX last night (his thoracic surgeon, whose name escapes me atm ). He asked me to describe you, so I told him you were less than 300 lbs. He was quite happy.""

About 10 minutes later his last doctor, the thoracic surgeon, comes up to meet him. His first words to my father were, ""Hi, my name is Dr. XXX. My God, you really are less than 300 lbs.""

My father is 5' 10"" and weighs 154 lbs.

We came to find out that this was the first patient this surgeon had seen in more than 2 months that weighed less than 300 lbs. While a large number of them had claimed to be less than 300 lbs my father was the first patient he'd seen in 2 months, more than 40 patients, that had not only been honest about his weight, but had been height/weight proportionate. 

He told my father, ""Once we reach 300 lbs it's a whole 'nother ball game. It's a longer surgery, it's a riskier surgery, and it's a longer and riskier recovery. Thank you for giving a shit about yourself. Too many people lie and make my job harder.""

So yeah, my dad was thanked by a surgeon for not being a blimp and for being honest about his weight.",My father was thanked by a surgeon for not weighing more than 300 lbs today.
fatpeoplestories,"So, my father had surgery today. Because of my family's relationship with this his hospitals we knew which room he was going to be sent to before he went to recovery. So my mother and I went and camped out there before his surgery even ended.

We took a bit to lay out his clothes, clean his dentures, put his cell phone on a charger, polish his glasses, and otherwise make the space he's going to be living in for the next few days livable when we hear it...

""CAIN'T NOBODY GO THAT LONG WITHOUT FOOOOOD!""

What the actual f???? 

My mother, bless her, is somewhat oblivious. Despite her own fat logic she has never been faced with full on Ham Planetry. That said, I am a full on Ham In Recovery. I used to weigh more than 400 lbs, I had a waist larger than 60 inches, I couldn't walk 10 feet without being winded.

I've not only heard the excuses, I've used them. I've used them a lot. So hearing them, after having lost nearly 200 lbs, just makes me want to listen harder. 

The patient next door had undergone a similar, but relatively minor, lumbar fusion. At least if you compared it to my father. From what I overheard the patient had received an L3 and L4 fusion a little while after my father had been admitted to surgery. 

From what I understood he was one of those patients who weighed more than 300 lbs but claimed to weigh a whole lot less. 

Upon entering recovery the patient's wife had been advised that he couldn't have food or drink for 24 hours after the surgery. And she had gone absolutely apeshit. She swore up and down that it was impossible for a ""full grown fucking adult male"" to go without food for 24 hours. This was ""flat up fucking fat-shaming"" and she was ""going to sue for fucking discrimination."" 

I'll give them this much, the hospital stood their ground while we were there. They argued with her, explained why dilaudid and food was a bad idea, and even told her how she was risking the life of her husband. 

When we left the hospital they were actively trying to take a bucket of KFC and a 2 liter of Pepsi out of her hands in front of her husband's room.","""CAIN'T NOBODY GO THAT LONG WITHOUT FOOOOOD!"""
fatpeoplestories,"First time posting, long time lurker and all that jazz. To give you an idea of how close I was to being a Hamlette, I'll give you some context. 5'08.5 female, still overweight but not obese any more, and never was considered morbidly obese.

For a long time I was overweight, but however I begin to really balloon was I was thirteen and during the spring of 2013, let's just say that there was some family issues regarding mental health, couple that with being sexually harassed a year ago and still not knowing how to cope, I began to spiral into a depression and begin to close myself off from others and ate a lot. This went on for a couple of years until in 2015, I was at my heaviest at 230 lbs, with the help of my mom, I went down to 225~. But I thought that so long as I am under 230, I should be good. How wrong I was.

However my real awakening came in the summer of 2016, when my mom called me into her bathroom and told me to look at myself. I saw my own reflection and was disgusted, I saw gross pimples, a pudgy stomach and flab. Seeing how upset I was my mom turned to me and said this (I'm paraphrasing here) ""I know that you see only pimples and an overweight girl, but I see cat-like green eyes, auburn hair, full lips, and an hourglass figure (My waist is narrow in comparison to my hips and shoulders, even while being a fatty-fat-fat). FireMoon, you really need to turn this around, from now on, I want you to be honest with yourself and start keeping a food journal, write down every little thing you eat and don't hide it.""

So I did, over the course of three months I wrote down every single god damn thing that went past my gullet. I went from 225 down to 197. A few months later I begin to run and even though I am still overweight (and chubby) according to bmi scale, I begin to develop muscle and toned up a considerable amount.

fatpeoplestories,"#**ROAD TRIP WITH GULA, Part 3**  

---   

As we were driving through Methville, trying to get back to the interstate, Gula pointed to a rundown Walmart (or possibly a Roses, I can’t really remember), “I got to pick up my prescriptions from here.”  

I pulled up to the front of the store to let her out.  I even let her use the wheelchair lift just to avoid making any more of a scene.  As she was being lowered she spotted something and leapt out of her stolen wheelchair, even though the lift was still a few feet off the ground.  She was sprinting to get her rolls in a genuine, store-brand mobility scooter; a.k.a.:  a scootypuff.   

After some time passed, she returned to the bus in her now overloaded scooter.  She has purchased two 24-packs of Gatorade, several boxes of full sized candy bars, and some 2-liter bottles of Pepsi and Mountain Dew.  When I saw that she bought snacks for the kids, my opinion of Gula heightened a bit.  At least she was thinking of others.  

She went back and eventually returned with another full scooter.  But this time she called for me to come outside the bus.  “Let the lift down I want to take this cart.”  

Even though I’ve been here for quite a while, I sometimes misunderstand English.  I thought this was one of those times.  “We can get it, there’s no need for [the lift],” as I went to take a few of the bags from the scooter.  

“No, silly, I want to take the whole cart, it’s a lot nicer than my chair.”  She said as she grabbed my arm to stop me from removing her bags.  

“You mean you want to take the whole cart?” I asked.  

“Yes,” she answered nonchalantly.  As if it was the most normal thing in the world to go about collecting stolen wheelchairs like some sort of disability faking hermit crab.  

I crouched down so that I was looking her in the eyes, “You mean to remove this cart from the store?” she shook her head in the affirmative.  “Well then, that is not a thing we are going to do.  We are not going to steal this cart or any other thing.  We will unload your bags, you will return the cart, and we will be on our way.  Okay?”  

“Fine.  Put it near my stuff and don’t break anything.  Jeez, you’re always such a killjoy,” she mumbled.  

---

A few minutes and some minor drama later, and we were finally back to the interstate.  Just as we were about to get on, I heard a most horrible noise from Gula, “WHO DID IT?”  She was absolutely losing her shit so I pulled onto the shoulder.  “Which one of you took my food?” she growled.  

“Are you talking about the Gatorade and snacks?” asked Carl.  

“Why would you take my food?  That’s *my* food,” she said.  Once again I became disappointed with her as I realized that she wasn’t thinking about others and that she hadn’t actually bought snacks for the kids.  “That has to last me four days.  Four.  Whole.  Days.”  

“Gula,” I said, trying to calm the situation down, “you get to eat in dining hall, just like the campers.”  

“I know that,” she shrieked.  “I’m a full grown woman, I need more than these little children.” (I would like to point out that Gula’s 18 or 19 and this group are all between 14 and 17.)  She wheeled around to Carl, “You owe me THREE DOLLARS for what you took.”  Carl whipped out a five and handed it to her.  She stuffed the bill in her bra and looked at Carl, “You ain’t getting no change.”  Then she literally strutted back to her seat like she had just won the biggest moral victory ever.   


---  


About an hour later, I heard Gula’s *faux nice* voice, “Jimmy, can we pull over.”  

“No, we’re behind schedule,” I replied.  

“But I have a *lady* problem,” said Gula.  

I pulled over at nearest rest stop and Gula ran and jiggled her way to the nearest lavatory.  I should point out that for the entire trip, I’ve had my phone connected to the bus’s Bluetooth system and have been listening to music over the speakers.  Then I got a call from Gula and the entire bus could hear.  

Upon answering all I could hear was Gula’s heavy breathing.  “You need to bring me my purse.”  

“What?” was all I could muster.  

“I said,” she was getting positively indignant, “I shit myself…” there was a long pause accompanied only by the sound of Gula straining.  Then the sound of a jet of liquid feces hitting water.  She continued, “I shit myself and you need to bring me my big purse.”  Everyone on the bus has turned red trying not to laugh.  

“I’m not coming into the ladies room, just clean yourself as best you and I’ll leave it by the door,” I offered.  

“Jim, now listen very carefully,” she said as she proceeded to speak slowly, one word at a time, “I. Am.  Butt. Naked. And. Covered. In. Shit. It. Is. Everywhere.  Now, just please bring me my big purse and an extra pair of shoes.”  

“Alright, we’ll do,” I said as I hung up.  I tried my hardest not to laugh, but the entire bus broke out as I hung up.  Greasy breakfast meats, cups of sugar, 2 pot of coffee, and racist cake:  that’s the recipe for a shit-cano.  I sent a brave volunteer in with Gula’s things.  

As I was restacking Gula’s things, the distinct packaging of a bottle of Everclear caught my eye.  This was weird for three reasons: first, Gula isn’t 21; second, you can only buy liquor in state-owned shops here; third, this was the 190-proof variety which is illegal in this state.  So I poured it out and refilled the bottle with faucet water.  

My brave volunteer walked over to the faucet and rinsed her shoes off, “It was everywhere, even the wall of the other stall.”  We went back to the bus and I rearranged Gula’s things.  

A few minutes later Gula returned to the bus walking with a cane.  She didn’t smell of feces; she smelled like breakfast sausage and coffee.  Once we were back on the road for a few minutes, it occurred to me that Gula had not gone into the bathroom with a cane.  To this day, I have no idea where she got the cane but I like to think she stole it from some poor octogenarian who passed-out at the sight of Gula’s ungodly bodily functions.  

---  

**TL/DNR:**  Gula tries to upgrade her stolen wheelchair, smuggle forbidden liquor, and steal someone’s cane.

","Summer Camp with Gula, Part 3"
fatpeoplestories,"Hey. You may remember my previous posts about Thickette. If not, here's what you missed: I have an obese ""friend"" who tells me I'm unhealthy all of the time. Upon finding out I was molested, she said that I was too skinny to be raped. She's a weird person. I feel like this next story almost sounds fake, but I promise it happened.

&amp;nbsp;

Me: 16, female. Approximately 5'3 and 93 lbs. That may sound bad, but I've been to several of doctors and they've all said I'm not too skinny.

&amp;nbsp;

Randomfriend: My friend. 16, female, a little bigger than me. A really great person, but not really important in this story. 

&amp;nbsp;

Thickette: A friend of a friend. Also 16 and female.  5'4. Says she's 200 lbs, but I would guess she's more. Always refers to herself as ""thick."" 

&amp;nbsp;

As most of you suggested, I've been sort of avoiding Thickette. I realized she's a very negative person and a waste of time to be around. I feel like some of you might have misjudged by personality, however. I am not scared to stand up for myself. I've had several different teenage boys tell me I'm ""the best roaster"" they've ever heard. I'm NOT thin skinned. I'm not sure why I've been so nice to Thickette. I guess I feel bad for her. I'm not offended by anything she says, I just think its funny. That's why I still talk to her somewhat. 

&amp;nbsp;

I digress.

&amp;nbsp;

Today I was eating lunch with Randomfriend. Thickette showed up. She did several things that are still making me laugh. The first was announcing that meatloaf is one of the most unhealthy foods on Earth. I don't think that's quite accurate, but I really wouldn't know. I don't eat meatloaf because I love myself. She also told me that frying foods makes them healthier (wtf?) and that I shouldn't eat fruit because they have sugar and sugar is bad for you. I tried to change the subject away from food by asking how her trip to Europe was. She said it was delicious. 

&amp;nbsp;

Randomfriend and I started talking about politics. I've always liked talking about this with her. She's definitely a republican and I'm more of a liberal, so I find it interesting to hear what she has to say. Thickette interrupts all of the time to say stuff like ""I don't understand! What does that mean! I'm bisexual!""

&amp;nbsp;

Lunch started rapping up and Randomfriend had to leave. It was then that Thickette noticed my shirt. I usually prefer to wear t shirts, but today I was wearing something nicer. It had a lower cut neck than what I usually wear, but it wasn't revealing at all. Nobody in their right mind would be bothered by what I was wearing. Thickette was bothered. She told me it was disgusting that she could see my collar bones. She whined, ""You're just wearing that to hurt meeee! How would you like it if I had my boobs out and was showing them off?"" For the record, I've seen Thickette's boobs. They're bigger than mine, but I'm not jealous because I think sometimes quality is more important than quantity. Also, how is a collarbone in any way related to a boob?

&amp;nbsp;

Feeling insecure, Thickette decided to boost her self esteem via bragging. ""It's not healthy to be able to see your collarbones. You may think you're healthy, but you're like a model."" Never in my life has anyone told me I look like a model. I took it as a compliment. 

&amp;nbsp;

""I'm not like other fat people anyway. I'm really strong. I have abs."" She grabbed my hand and pushed it into her stomach, trying to pass off her fat rolls as muscles. I almost started laughing. She say my expression and started backtracking. ""Well, maybe my abs are covered in fat, so you can't feel them. But I have abs!"" I told her that everyone technically had abs, and she said ""Well, not everyone...""",Thickette has ABS

Some of the colleges and universities near Camp offer clinics aimed at specific sports or activities like theater performance.  These are multi-day masterclasses by college coaches that can offer aspiring athletes and sportsmen a glimpse at what it means to perform at the next level.  Parents can sign their campers and we arrange transportation to and from the clinics.  

Some of the clinics require that a “coach” come with larger groups.  The coach is just an adult who is more-or-less there to be responsible for the conduct of their attendees.  Some clinics offer classes to coaches, others just let them enjoy the campus or city.  For the counselors at our camp, coaching is seen as a bit of a paid vacation:  you get to be away from camp and might even get to sit in on a few interesting classes.  

---

Gula has been back at camp for the better part of a week.  She’s still using her stolen wheelchair.  Gina, Gula’s mother and the camp’s administrator, has arranged for Gula to be the “coach” for the next clinic trip, a track and field clinic.  (I can’t remember if I was supposed to be the coach for that trip or if it was someone else.)  I will be the bus driver for the trip mostly because I have a bus driver’s license.  


---

It’s the day of the clinic trip and we’re taking the new bus.  The new bus is larger, more comfortable, and easier to drive on the highway.  Incidentally, it also has a wheelchair lift.  It’s still dark out when our mixed group is ready to leave.  Everyone is wearing what amounts to a camp uniform:  track pants and a camp T-shirt.  I’m also wearing a track jacket and my whistle, because I look good in gym-teacher chic.  

Gula was nowhere to be found.  So I tried to take advantage of my luck and leave camp without her.  As we passed the admin building I saw Gula sitting outside with her bags and stolen wheelchair.  She wasn’t even in her camp uniform, just a pair of colorful pajama bottoms and a random T-shirt.  I thought about leaving her, but the light was on in Gina’s office so I would probably have to answer for it.  

I pulled over to pick up Gula, but she didn’t come to the door—she just sat in her chair.  I got off as Gula was giggling, “The garage is too far, but I knew you’d have to come by here.”  She moved her chair over to the lift, “Well, let the lift down, so we can get on the road.”  Not wanting to get on Gina’s bad side, I complied.  As she was rising into the bus she shouted, “My bags ain’t going to get themselves.” But no one moved.  She was now on the bus.  “Go get my bags, we got to get on the road,” she whined while looking straight at Carl.  He got the bags and we were off.  

An hour or so later it was still dark, but the sun was just coming up.  I could see Gula’s shadowy figure walking up the aisle.  “Jimmy,” I hear in sing-song, faux sweet tone.  (Obviously my name isn’t “Jim”, but she called me by a diminutive form of my real name.)  “Jimmy, pull over for some breakfast.”  

“Gula,” I said, “there’s nowhere to eat, it’s just woods.”  

“Oh, just pull over at this next exit.” She said pointing to a very close turnoff.  “You’re about to miss it! Pull over now. Now! NOW!”  She leaned over my driver’s seat and attempted to take the wheel.  Her gut or chest was enveloping my head as I was pumping the brakes.  Gula got her way and we ended up taking the exit.  I was seething and looking for the nearest ramp back to the highway, but there were none to be found.  “Calm down,” said Gula, “the quickest way back is to the right.”  

We travelled down the road for about 15 minutes.  Right before I was about give up and turn around, Gula pointed to a restaurant and we pulled in.  The restaurant seemed quite nice considering it was surrounded by a dilapidated small town that might as well have been called Methville.  At some point it had clearly been an IHOP, but was now a circus themed place; the parking lot looked brand new; and it seemed relatively popular.  I parked in the truck parking, near the rear of the building, and everyone got off… except Gula.  “Jimmy,” I heard in the same sickening tone as before, “can you pull around to the front so I can get off?”

I looked around and saw Gula back in her stolen wheelchair.  “No,” I said as I threw her the door key, “lock up when you decide to get off.”  I left to join the campers in the restaurant.  A few minutes after we had all been seated, in rolled Gula.  It was only now that I was able to behold her ensemble in the full light.  She wore neon pink pajama bottoms, matching Crocs, and a much too small T-shirt from the London Olympics.  As a group we looked like a fairly elite high school track team, their coach, and our disabled, possibly color blind bus driver.  

She made a bee line for our table and ran into or over any customer, staff member, or piece of furniture that got in her way.  “Hey, y’all, time to eat,” she sang out as she assumed her place at the opposite end of a long table from me.

Even though they had a menu, everyone ordered the breakfast buffet.  I walked away to look at what was in the buffet worth eating as Gula was ordering.  As the first couple of campers were returning with their breakfasts, she was still ordering.  

I was milling around the various buffet stations when the restaurant manager came up to me, “I’m sorry we don’t have a military discount.  But thank you for your service, sir.”  

“Oh I’m not in the military,” I said.  I’m fit, I have a crew cut, and my head is stitched together like a baseball, he was probably mistaking me for someone else.

“It’s okay,” he said, “you’re with friends.”  He lifted up a pant leg to reveal a prosthetic leg beneath.  “Baghdad, ’06.”  

“No really, I’ve never been in the military.”  I retorted as I was growing more and more confused by the man’s persistence.  

“But, your wife just asked for a military discount?” said the manager who was growing perturbed.  

Now I’m certain he’s made a mistake because I’m not married, and certainly not to a woman.  “Oh,” I said as I held up my ringless left hand, “I’m not married.”

“Oh I’m sorry, that woman in the wheelchair asked about a discount.”   

I began desperately looking around, hoping that there would be some other woman in a wheelchair.  But no—just Gula.  Gula is dressed like she just rolled out of bed; I’ve tailored my T-shirt to show off my body and my hair is perfectly combed—how dare he think I’m married to Gula.  I was disappointed, angered, and embarrassed as I let out a sigh, “Just send me the bill, don’t deal with her.  She’s unwell… mentally.”  He seemed to accept this explanation.

As I sat down, Gula had finished ordering: to my surprise she seemed to have a normal amount of food.  But then over her shoulder I could see our server point out Gula to one of the cooks in the back.  Then the server came out with a large glass of ice and a ramekin of what I would later find out was powdered sugar.  Gula then dumped spoonful after spoonful of sugar into her coffee along with a couple of ice cubes.  Then she drank it in one go.  The server came around with a pot of coffee, as she bent down to pour Gula another cup, I heard Gula pipe up, “You can leave the pot.”  Gula would go on to finish two pots of coffee and three ramekins of powdered sugar.  

As the entire group is finishing, the server asks if we’re ready.  I said ‘yes’, thinking she would bring the bill.  But no, the server went to the back and returned with a team of staff members carrying a cake and singing happy birthday to Gula.   Once they had finished, Gula threw both arms up, but her eyes never left the cake:  “Oh Jimmy, you shouldn’t have.”    

I was literally speechless when I saw the cake “I” had bought for Gula.  It was a funnel cake, topped with an inch of chocolate ice cream.  Just as I saw the big maraschino cherry lips and realized it was decorated to look like a face, Ben, the only black camper on this trip, leans over toward Carl and me and says, “Is that a [N-word] cake?”  And it was.  It looked like a [golliwog]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Gollywog_in_Shop%2C_Widecombe-in-the-Moor_%287416065542%29.jpg) made out of food stuffs.   

I paid the bill and left the restaurant with the campers in tow.  As we were walking back to the bus, Carl came up and imitated Gula’s sing song voice:  “Jimmy, when it’s my fake birthday, will you get me a [N-word] cake?”

**TL/DNR:**  Gula nearly kills a bus of campers in her pursuit of sugary coffee and racist cake.

","Summer Camp with Gula, Part 2"
fatpeoplestories,"I am still blown away that this actually happened, but here we go. 
The other day, the club I'm in at college hosted a speaker. We ordered a bunch of food that people could munch on while listening. The event went great, and after everyone left, it was just the main members of the club cleaning up. 
There was a lot of food left, so we decided to split it up among the group members who wanted it. Heres where the ham planet comes in. We will refer to them as HP in this, and myself as BA (blown away). 
Of course while splitting up the food HP takes two large things of pad thai, and rice. It's a lot of food for one person, and way more than their share, but I just let it be and grabbed myself a container with salad in it, and I grab one of the dressings that came on the side. 
I set this to the side with my things and go to help clean the rest of the trash. 
Roughly ten minutes later, I come back to my things and the dressing is gone. I took the only salad, so I was confused, I ask out loud ""Did anyone move my dressing?
And thats when I made eye contact with HP. Who is literally DRINKING THE DRESSING OUT OF THE CONTAINER. 
""I didn't think you'd want it"" She manages to say between slurps.

fatpeoplestories,"#**THE STORY OF GULA**

---

I would like to bring back the Summer Camp and Gula stories, but first I think I should answer some questions.

*Why did you stop?*  
I stopped because someone at Camp found out and threatened to withhold an employment recommendation.  

*Why are you starting again?*  
While students get a Spring Break, teachers have to show up or take vacation time.  I’m bored and have no more work to do; the Head Master confiscated my sling shot; and I have tenure so it’s safe to post again.  I plan to finish the story from where I left off, and then go back and re-do  what I deleted as a prequel.  

**Background Information**

A few years ago **I, Jim,** was a camp counselor, bus driver, assistant athletic director, etc. at a summer camp.  I am a well-built but short Swedish guy who has many scars on his scalp from an incident.  I like to work out because I am super vain.

 My best friend and work out buddy at camp is **Ryan**.  Ryan is huge, nearly a foot taller than me and 275 pounds of solid muscle.  He is a teddy bear who I’ve only ever seen angry once.  He works in the *healthy living* camp on the other side of the lake.

**Rebecca** is Ryan’s fiancé, they go to the same university.  She used to be the swim instructor for the camp, but was replaced by Gula, and is now a counselor: she swims for her college team.  While the swim instructor and counselors make the same, the swim instructor gets more-or-less private quarters in the camp’s boat house while counselors have semi-private rooms at the back of the cabins.

**Carl** is a camper and my sister and his brother are married.  Carl has only one eye but aside from that is a normal healthy camper… when he’s not being a little shit.


**Coach** is the camp’s Athletic Director and he creates individual work-out plans for the kids in the *healthy living camp*.  He is a retired Marine.  

**Gina** is the camp administrator.  She’s not technically the boss, but she can put you in a world of hurt if you don’t do things to her satisfaction.  She is also Gula’s mom.

**Gula** is the camp’s swimming instructor.  At five foot four inches and barely 200 lbs she isn’t that fat by American standards.  Her main problem is her gluttony, her laziness, and her so-called fatlogic.  Most of the counselors believe she used nepotism to swipe Rebecca’s job.  She loves sugar, she loves attention or pity, and she loves getting her way.

**THE STORY SO FAR**

Gula has taken my personal car, and returned it to camp full of crumbs and a spilled milkshake.  In addition to this she left the top down and my car is now full of ants and flies.  A little after that, someone secretly mixed beta-alanine into one of her 2-Liter Pepsi bottles, she drinks four each day.  Gula went to the hospital, was called an attention seeker, and was booted out.   She stole a hospital wheelchair on her way out and has been rolling around camp in it ever since.  


**Gula’s Return**

*A short anecdote before a longer story tomorrow*

Gula returned to camp yesterday but is still in her stolen wheelchair today, I think she intends to keep it.  She is not, however, fit for life in a wheelchair.  Our dining hall has both stairs and a ramp outside its front entrance.  If you can’t use the stairs, you use the ramp.

Gula blew off her morning work.  She showed up to breakfast after everyone else had left.  She wheeled herself up the first landing of the ramp.   There she sat for a few moments, clearly she was contemplating.   She stood up looked over the railing for the ramp and lifted her wheelchair over the railing to the top of the stairs.  She then tried roll herself over the railing.  That didn’t work.  So she crawled beneath the railing, dusted herself off, sat down, and rolled her way into the dining hall.

fatpeoplestories,"Long time lurker, first time posting! On mobile, sorry for format. 

Character rollup! 
HamDad - no idea weight, but he was easily pushing 400lbs+ when I was growing up. Since has likely got down to 300lbs, and has been steadily growing in size since meeting new wife, SheHam.

SheHam - (small part in story, but also growing Ham since meeting my dad. Has condishuns, guys. Is likely 270lbs rough estimate) I64cm approx. 50 years old. 

MeHam - daughter of said HamDad. 170cm approx, 180lbs but that has come down from 210lbs in roughly 6 weeks. (Im getting there guys! Ham in Recovery) 24 years old. 


Now. Its quite a short one. This just happened and I have to let it out. I might make a series of this. 

My HamDad is diabetic, type 2. Surprise surprise. He has always had an superiority complex, and thinks he's twice as intelligent as you - and will tell you this to your face, trust me. This is despite never working a day in my entire life (yup, one of those), and not completing school. Ive also never seen him read a book, but I digress. 

He married SheHam some years ago, and both of them have skyrocketed in weight - especially SheHam. SheHam is very nice, can't fault her, but her weight is definitely going to be doing some damage - has developed arthritis. 

Some context - as mentioned, I've finally been shedding some of my own weight after being overweight for a long, long old time. It feels great! HamDad and SheHam have been... not the most supportive of this. The constant body acceptance they keep trying to push on me, and also pressuring me into eating the same food as they do, including the junk (I have resisted so far) has caused some friction. I don't live with them, but it makes visiting difficult because of the food. Its a battle. 

As mentioned, HamDad has had diabeties for quite some years. Its mostly been under control, and actually caused his initial weight loss due to the sugar cut. This seems to have been thrown out the window in the last year. I often to come visit and see them eating chocolate biscuits, fizzy drinks, massive (mahoosive) portions that could feed three people each, chocolate and I've seen him demolish, without mercy, an entire multipack bag of crisps to himself in one sitting. 

Now, as for what has happened today to cause me to slink out of the shadows... 

HamDad has just come back from the nurse who monitors his diabeties. He went alone, come back, opened a pack of chocolate biscuits and proceeded to explain what happened. 
The Nurse had told HamDad his blood sugars were high. Too high. And that they were thinking of switching him to another, stronger medication for it as he clearly isn't doing very well with low dose medication and diet control. 

HamDad wouldn't tell us what his blood sugars were, with the excuse he was not told what it was - just that it was high. Which is codswallop, because they even tell me my own blood sugar when I go for a health check. Anyway. 

He then goes into a rant regarding how the nurse doesnt know what she's talking about, that he is twice as intelligent as she is (told you), and that she was patronising. 

What did this Nurse say, you ask? 

She told him that his high blood sugar was a huge risk to his health, that he was entering danger zones regarding circulation to his feet and legs and risked having a heart attack at levels the Nurse wasn't comfortable with. 

His reply? 

""Well, I could walk out and get hit by a bus, who cares!"" 
 
The Nurse asked him again if he understood what she was telling HamDad, and HamDad was very smug in explaining that he told her that 'He wasnt stupid'. Ironic. 


So, here we are. SheHam is agreeing with HamDad, shaking their heads and muttering how the nurse doesn't know anything and that they aren't alive forever and thus will eat what they damn like. 

He is spouting FatLogic like its going out of Fashion - 
""Its all a ploy anyway, they have to say this stuff to anyone remotely over weight."" 
""My blood sugar is fine even if it's very high."" 
""I will eat chocolate if I want, I eat vegetables at dinner"" 

HamDad, my Dad, cares more about chocolate biscuits than living for his children, grandchildren and wife. 

I am worried for my dad, my HamDad. And the FatLogic that could very possibly cost him his life. 

(Edit - formatting. Damn mobiles.) 
",Tales of the Probably Doomed HamDad
fatpeoplestories,"My brother is older than me. he left school aged 16. he is a practical man, and loves building things, so he ended up as a welder making/repairing horseboxes. ideal job, right? 

wrong.

the people he worked with were/are scum. bullies. they'd do stuff like put dog shit in my brothers lunch box. they hated him because they found out he was from a middle class family, and they were all working class. the bullying affected him, as you would expect from working in such a poisonous environment.

he started to eat.

to begin with, it didn't really have an effect. he was working a physically demanding job, and what he was eating was more than matched with it.

he moved on from that job, and his poor eating habits continued. he also developed a overly cheerful, talkative persona. i'd guess it was a defense mechanism - play the clown, and people will laugh and leave you alone. 

after the welding job, he bounced around for a while, and soon tired of warehouse/welding jobs, as the bullying continued wherever he went. he decided to go to the local university, the same one as I was about to attend, at the same time as I did. It was then when I noticed his fatlogic. things like

         portion sizes - he'd happily prepare a portion that was 3 times or more than is necessary. i once saw him get 
         a microwave pizza (12"") and stick some super noodles on top. (which is gross). even now, he'll go to his in- 
         laws for christmas dinner, have a massive plate, and then come to our parents and have a plate to himself. 

         with ready meals, he’d get two, and complain that one “wasn’t enough for a normal person”

          he is VERY concerned about “everyone getting their fair share” with stuff like cake. he'll make sure that the 
          sizes are exactly the same. i long ago realised it wasn't so everyone got the same, it was so he didn't get 
          any less.

          “I work a very physically demanding job. I burn off loads”. Which is fine. except when your intake is 5, and 
            you burn off 3, you’re still eating too much.

           He doesn’t eat breakfast or lunch, but has a massive dinner at the end of the day to make up for it.

            He doesn’t like going to the gym, because “people will stare at me”. 

           “this is all muscle”, while he slaps his belly. (imagine homer slapping his belly)

            For a time he’d call our dad fat. Our dad, who played rugby for approx. 30 years until well into his 60s, 
            and only stopped when he broke his leg. Our dad, who is on numerous medications, some of which cause 
            water retention in his arms, legs and belly. If that wasn’t the case he’d be close to having a six pack, as he 
            still tries to work out in his garage twice a week.

he met his wife about 8 years ago. back then, he was a big guy, but was still at a point where if he chose a healthy lifestyle, he could reverse the trend. she was a larger girl also, but I don’t know what her eating habits are (mostly cos I’m not a massive fan of her for other reasons and don’t really talk to her that much).

An aside: I’m a big believer in the power of relationships – specifically that your partner is there to make you a better person, either directly through encouragement, or indirectly through example. My gf has slowly encouraged healthy eating habits, to the point where we take turns cooking. We always cook from scratch, and very rarely do we eat the same thing twice, and it is mostly made from fresh ingredients. (though we're not adverse to the occasional takeaway) 

My brothers gf (now wife) is not the same as my gf. There is a picture of him and her, back when they were first going out. They looked big, but not huge. When she became pregnant recently with their second child, my mother murmured to me that she couldn’t tell that she was pregnant for the entirety of her pregnancy. He has also ballooned in size

The other side to my brother is that he suffers from IBS. I’m no medical expert, but I’d imagine the first thing you would do if you suffered from this is to change your diet. Experiment with different foods to see what causes/exacerbates the effects of the IBS. Has this changed his eating habits? 

No.

It’s a really sad situation. He’s currently at another warehouse job that he hates, recovering from a serious workplace injury (head trauma) which causes really bad headaches, with two kids they can’t really afford. I know he’s going to be comfort eating, and when those kids grow up, they’ll mirror their eating habits. 

The only thing I can do is help as best I can from the sidelines and limit the potential damage.

fatpeoplestories,"Hi all! Long time lurker here-posting this story because of what happened!

Be me: F, 35, 5-6 and 113 pounds. Finally a fully qualified, practicing pediatrician.

I live in a generally overweight area. Obesity is not uncommon, and I have to talk to about half the parents I meet about weight. 

Unfortunately, several of our nurses just quit, for a series of reasons, meaning I have to do some nurse duties for the next few weeks. It gives me new appreciation for them. 

Normal afternoon, until I call one of my patients. According to the chart, her name is K--------, 14 first time visitor. I call her name, and nobody responds. I call her name again, and one of the moms sitting around glances up. She looks plump, probably around 170 pounds. However, next to her is a teenage girl who can't even fit into one of the doctors office seats, and is sitting ok the armrests because of it. She is playing on her phone, ignoring her mom tugging on her extremely large arm. Eventually, she looks over, and says something. They appear to begin arguing, getting louder Andrew louder. It becomes clear that K is refusing to go in. Soon enough, her mom gets her to go in by promising to get her a chocolate cake at the local cake shop afterwards. She agrees, but only after reaffirming that she will have it all to herself. I now have the child and the mom waddling towards me. I take them in, trying to be as professional as possible, though the child's outfit-what is clearly supposed to be a stylish crop top and leggings-doesn't leave much to the imagination, except what color the wasteband of the leggings is. I take them into a room, confirm that this is first well child visit, and try to take vitals. However, child's mom pulls me aside and asks for her not to be weighed, as they don't believe in weight. I say that I would highly recommend against that, as it will hurt the advise I can give. After some more grumbling, I convince her to let me. Child steps on scale, I glance down, glance back down, one last time. I ask her to get off, and weigh myself, checking that the scale isn't broken. I ask her to get on again, thinking she may have been off-center? Nope. No such luck. She is 352 pounds at 5-3. At this point, we try to take blood pressure, but need to switch units to get the right cuff size. Not looking good. 170/100. I decide to refer her for a more in-depth examination. Next, I talk to them. Daughter is still on her phone. I try to get her attention several times, before she finally looks up, and says the following: my only problem is that modern society descriminates against me. I have to wear adults clothes at 14, just because I am a healthy size.

 I am at a loss about what to do at this point. I decide to speak to them separately, daughter first. I tell her as nicely as possibly that she could focus on moving more to make sure that her muscles know what to do. She says she doesn't need to do sports, she is stronger than all her classmates. I encourage her to eat healthier, to which she says she agrees that she needs to change her diet: she still feels hungry some days. I give up, and bring her mom in, who I talk to a bit more harshly. I am not rude, I just tell her she needs to do something, her daughters weight is more than double the cutoff for obesity. She accuses me of calling her daughter fat, and says that it is discrimination. She ends up yelling at me, and I let them go. 


I was so saddened by this. As the girl waddled out, I see her shirt riding up, and realize that her stomach is literally coming down to her thighs. I don't know how to help her, and I feel terrible ",Doctor's Office Young Hams
fatpeoplestories,"I haven't told a story for a little while, so I guess it's time to let everyone know about another story. This one's rather long, so if you're on a train or have a long commute, or if you just have a lot of time, I hope this makes everything a little more bearable for you. If you've ever read any of my other stories, you can find out that I'm a security guard for a high end, expensive condo. The area is really nice and the infrastructure is great, but some of the people can be incredibly unreasonable and entitled. This story happens to fall in line with that description. 

A few months ago, I posted a story about a ""Ms. Orcablubber"", detailing how she may just be the hammiest person in this building. For those of you who haven't read the story on her, she's basically a walking pile of carbs on legs thicker than the iceberg that sunk the Titanic with an attitude that makes Amy Schumer look like a gentle, meek woman. This wonderful person also asked me to help clean her home, of which she is responsible. Helping residents clean *isn't* in my job description, so I think you can figure out how that went. If not, you can see how it ended up [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/7ci9lv/ms_orcablubber_needs_help/)

I rarely heard from Ms. Orcablubber, or anyone going up to 201 for that matter. Regardless, today I found out that Ms. Orcablubber isn't as antisocial as she led on to be.

It happened a week ago.

It's around 5:30 PM, I'm almost halfway into my shift at the desk. I'm surfing Reddit, looking up stuff to pass the time, then out of the corner of my eye, I spot her. I see Ms. Orcablubber. Now bear in mind, I don't see her very often, and to have her come through the lobby and not through our back elevator (we have an elevator that is located in the garage to help people get to their apartments faster) is a surprise. She comes into the lobby and addresses me. I'm surprised she remembered my name, let alone call me by it. I didn't call her ""Ms Orcablubber"" or anything. I just said ""hello miss"" because she's divorced.

She approaches my desk. Same dress, same smell, same look.

""Hey Kingofthekek, I'm having a few friends over for a couple of days. They're coming in from a few hours up north and they want to stay here for a bit""

""Alright, I can call you once they get here. Do you know how long it would be before they arrive?""

""About an hour. I want to book some of the uhh... guest suites we got over here""

(We have guest suites available for anyone who wants to use them. They're usually for guests coming to visit from long distances or for people who don't have a place to stay temporarily. It's $65 a night with their choice of 2 twin beds or 1 queen bed).

""Well...we don't really do last minute check-ins like this... But I'll have a look.""

Find out there are 3 rooms available: 2 rooms with 1 queen bed, and 1 room with 2 twin beds.

""We have a few rooms available, listed with this information (I turn the computer to her)""

""Yeaaaahhhhhhhh gimme the 2 twins"".

""How many nights?""

""A few.""

""Oooookay, I'll need a specific number though...""

""4 nights""

""Okay, I'll just need a $260 check, $65 a night, addressed to the building management please""

""**Check??**""

She thought these rooms were **free use**. She's been living here for years... If they were free use, she'd be using them more than the apartment she lives in just to avoid cleaning it.

I reluctantly explain the entire process and all that, and she pulls out her checkbook she just has on her for some reason??? She hands me a check with information correctly displayed and everything in order, except for the thumb-sized oil spot on the top right of the check. I file it in and send the check in an envelope to management.

*an hour passes*

I get told there's a minivan in the courtyard that needs some assistance with luggage. I immediately assume its Ms Orcablubber's guests, so I sluggishly get out of my chair and grab a cart to store all their luggage in. I make the short distance to the courtyard, and instead of finding Ms Orcablubber's guests, I see... **copies**

[activatethedroids.mp4] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gPQ3WXy7-0&amp;feature=youtu.be)

It has begun. Ms Orcablubber has begun the process. She's **multiplying**.

Two hulking masses of women lean out of the minivan, breathing heavily with each push. Visibly distressed from exiting the van. It was like watching a moose in heat trying to unhook its antlers from a traffic sign. **HUGE** bags of luggage, about their size. These two women were, at best, 5'3, weighing in at a solid 350 lbs. Both wearing worn-out Nike sports shoes. One had blonde hair, the other had dark brown hair. Their legs were so thick and their knees were so thin they almost seemed like they had over inflated balloons as legs. Their arms are only what I could describe as wings of fat, and their elbows were puckered so hard I thought they were about to kiss me. I had never seen two people look so identical in stature and size. They looked **exactly like Ms Orcablubber**. Ms Orcablubber said she had *friends* coming over, not *family*, so I assumed they're not related.

But as God as my witness, I swear these women were practically identical. Probably part of some allegiance to each other, because all three of them wore floral dresses that didn't fit them entirely.

I inch up to them with my cart, and try to muster what can only be described as a concerned smile. I greet them and help move their luggage. They just respond with a grunt.

**Jesus fucking Christ these are heavy** I'm a big guy too, so this kind of thing should be a walk in the park for me. But this time, it was actually overbearing. These bags of luggage were huge and heavy and I still have no idea why.

I manage to put their luggage in the cart, wheeling it over slowly with tweedle dee and tweedle dum in tow. I get back to my desk in the lobby and attempt to check them in. Ms Orcablubber is in the lobby waiting for them and she gives them a ""hug"". She couldn't wrap her arms around her guests' arms (lol). Ms Orcablubber was actually a little taller (it seemed) than the two guests. Let's refer to the guests as Jupiter and Neptune. Jupiter and Neptune were also not related, to my surprise. They just happened to look like each other. I actually ended up asking them, and I'm glad they didn't take it the wrong way.

So we're at the desk. I hand them their keys, and I tell them where the guest suites are located. Jupiter and Neptune leave with Ms Orcablubber and I'm finally at rest again. Not even 20 minutes into their stay, I see the Jupiter (the blonde one) come to my desk. I'm still surfing Reddit leisurely and don't even notice her walk in. Jupiter begins to speak.

""Hey do you have any bigger beds?""

""Oh uh..we do but they're only single queen beds, and they're located in different rooms.""

""Move me and my friend to the other rooms then.""

""Is something wrong? Are one of the beds broken?""

""No we can't fit""

""Ohhhhh...""

[THIS] (https://me.me/market?meme_id=7288779) CLOSE TO LOSING MY SHIT. I was actually thinking to myself that it'd be okay to get fired over laughing at this.

""Well, I'm sorry but we can't move rooms once you've entered them. It's against our policy.""

""What policy? We didn't make a mess just lock up the room and give us the other ones.""

This is a very suspect phrase.

""Are you asking for two rooms?""

""Yeah, you said you had two rooms right? Two queens?""

I explain to Jupiter that we can't switch rooms, and that she'll have to make do with what's been given to her. If I switched rooms after someone had already settled down, I'd get into monumental shit. 

She's also asking to be put in separate rooms now. Separate rooms with separate beds. I tell her that even if she wanted another room, Ms Orcablubber would have to pay extra for the other room. 

This is when she starts getting angry.

She starts talking about how she and her friend can't fit onto the beds and that sleeping would be impossible. She told me that ""legally"" I'm supposed to make an accommodation for someone who can't fit. I keep trying to explain that If she wanted another room I'd be able to give her one and have one person take the two twin beds and push them together. She insisted that because the beds did not support her size that she and her friend should be entitled to two separate rooms with queen beds, **completely free**.

I keep trying to tell her that's now how it works and she just won't listen to reason. Neptune and Ms Orcablubber come back downstairs to see what the problem is. Jupiter explains how I won't give them the other two rooms and that I'm ""being discriminatory"" towards them. Naturally, they also jump in and start trying to persuade me into giving them rooms for free. I keep trying to tell them that's against policy and asking for free rooms is pretty asinine, but they insisted that I break policy and possibly get myself fired because they think they're entitled to something because they're overweight.

At this point, 2 planets and large sea creature are angry at me. I end up calling for backup. I don't ask my supervisor this time, because he's not around. Instead, I ask management, or what I refer to as ""the big guns"". Usually whenever someone calls management, shit has already hit the fan. Management is in charge of the entire building and will do whatever it takes to have policy take priority over anything. I call up the head manager, Chris, and he heads to my desk.

A really long talk ensues, of which I'll spare you the details, and it ends up with Jupiter kicking over a potted plant we had in our lobby. Chris didn't seem fazed by this at all, and instead ends up charging the costs of the potted plant to Ms Orcablubber.

This all concludes when I get Ms Orcablubber to sign another check for a queen size bed in another room, oddly enough with the same oil spot in the exact location as the last one. Neptune ends up shoving both twin beds together and making one big bed. Jupiter, being the delicate flower she is, moves to the queen bed.

Fast forward to the next day, I get a call from Chris thanking me for keeping cool during that situation, and that the party involved was ""dealt with"".

I only recently found out that what Chris meant by ""dealt with"" was that they were kicked out. This is because after I had left and after the first night passed, one of the legs on the bed that Neptune sat on actually *broke*. Chris confronted them about this when one of our cleaners reported it to him. Apparently they got really heated and confrontational and insisted they won't pay the fees required to fix the bed. So, with accordance to some fine print, Chris ended up removing them, telling Ms Orcablubber that Jupiter and Neptune are barred from using the rooms ever again. 

Now every time I see Ms Orcablubber, I get the million mile stare from her. Doesn't bother me that much, that whole debacle made for a good story.
","""The Beds are Discriminating Against Us!"" BlubberTales™"
fatpeoplestories,"Mrs. Worm has struggled with her body for a long time.  She’s been overweight – obese – for as long as she can remember and has poor health because of it.  There are many stories of loved ones’ weight and failing health, but to put it simply: she’ll die earlier than her family, and we will have to keep living without her.

---

“...Starvation mode, you know.  When you don’t eat, your body knows you're starving and starts holding onto everything it can,” said Mrs. Worm while hovering over the stovetop, “I just don’t want you to damage your metabolism, like what I did when I was your age.”  She was competing in volume with sizzling oil and the hood’s fan, and the words came out harsher than she might have meant to sound.

Sitting in a chair and tucked away in what had become the family’s dining room, although it was really only an inny-outty bit of the kitchen with a good spot for the TV, Littleworm was horrified by this revelation.  Suddenly powerless over her own body, she ate everything on her plate that night without tasting a thing.

“She’s got a high BMI for her age.  Good thing she’s tall,” added the doctor, pointing to a pen mark on a wavy chart with reds and yellows and greens.  He swiveled toward Mrs. Worm, who was squeezed comfortably into the only other chair in the room.  “Try yogurt and fish, and make sure she’s exercising.”

After the appointment the Worms went straight to the grocery store and bought a whole basket of fruity yogurts and catfish.  Eating them and going on morning walks didn’t make Littleworm any thinner, and after a week Mrs. Worm shrugged and merely said, “When I was your age I wanted so badly to be thin that I only ate a bowl of cottage cheese a day and walked miles, and look at me now,” and continued layering cheese into that night’s lasagna.  Littleworm did look at her, saw nothing she wanted for herself, and wiped quite suddenly at her eyes.  It made her throat inexplicably hot and tight to know her mother and she were born to be a little uglier, slower and clumsier than other folks.

Occasionally Littleworm did lose weight, even if it piled right back on again.  In fact, the only time Littleworm lost any weight at all was during the summer.  She ate the same and exercised the same – except for swim team practice, two hours a day – so weight really was just a tragic, inexplicable birthright.  Between the female Worms’ expanding waistlines and Mr. Worm looking the same as he ever did, the family just assumed that Littleworm had gotten bad luck in genetics and left it at that.  And when Littleworm stopped growing in height and kept growing in weight, well, no one could deny she was just a spitting image of her mother, whom Mr. Worm assured was gorgeous and wonderful in every way.

One day Littleworm went to college and returned 5 months later twenty pounds lighter.  Mrs. Worm, worried about the stresses of studying or some silent illness, fretted and fussed and made lots of fried potatoes for dinner that night.

Littleworm went back for another semester, returning again fifteen pounds lighter.  Happy with a chart-healthy daughter (and perhaps a little jealous on Mrs. Worms’ part, since Mr. Worm’s genetics had obviously kicked in) the Worms bought a smaller pair of jeans and a big chocolate cake for her birthday and thought nothing else of it.  But Littleworm thought on it.

Come the beginning of next semester, Littleworm had decided to get to the bottom of it all.  She knew food had something to do with weight, in the kind of hazy, dreamy way most people put two-and-two together, get three and don’t go much further.  But Littleworm was in school now, and was learning to find facts and cite sources and question assumptions, and thought she could do the same here.  Perhaps people could eat enough not to go into starvation mode, but not too much, and if that was possible then by the Fat Friar she would find out.  Hypothesis in mind, Littleworm stuck herself into a chair at a computer and determined not to leave until all was satisfied.
If Littleworm had been wiser, or luckier, she would have stuck to scientific journals and papers, would have even tried to test her hypothesis with a balanced diet, but instead she found a photo.  It was of a girl her age, quite candidly posed in front of a mirror in just her underwear, hipbones stuck out like puzzle pieces.  Clearly, this girl knew something.  Following the photo to its website, Littleworm found herself some truths that were, perhaps, not phrased in the most helpful ways.  Unsurprisingly, Littleworm came away with truly unhealthy ideas.  As a fat, ungainly recluse for most of her life, the only thing Littleworm ever thought to pride herself on was her willpower.  Now, that willpower, she was told, could be the currency for a better body.

She came back home 116 lbs at 5’8”, having eaten herself up inside doing it.  If the Worms knew anything, they said little.  Mrs. Worm cooked when she was happy, but she also cooked when she was unhappy, and that Christmas she cooked a lot.  Littleworm argued now when Mrs. Worm would start on her usual “It’s Starvation Mode, you know,” and her “I ate so little and never lost a pound,” and with the subject already so touchy the Worms tended to avoid the topic of weight altogether.  Mrs. Worm’s buttocks grew steadily while she tried out new diets and new recipes – vegan meatballs, bulletproof coffee, keto cookies – and huffed over her thyroid and metabolism under her shortening breath.  Littleworm silently and rapidly yo-yo’ed in weight from one semester to the next, blaming frequent after-meal bathroom trips on a suddenly weak stomach.  Mr. Worm stuck with his steak and salad and weekend hikes, as he had for years.

---

There are many stories of loved ones’ weight gain, failing health, of knowing their families will have to live without them.  It’s obvious that Mrs. Worm will die sooner and earlier and her family will miss her so much and have to learn live without her.  Littleworm has talked at length, is trying her best, and knows Mrs. Worm has heard explanations of weight loss and gain over and over and still does not comprehend.  And sometimes, just sometimes, Littleworm wonders if her mother has been where she is, has known what she knows, and has instead chosen to forget.  After all, her death will come at the hands of diabetes, heart and joint strain, and they are the slower killers.",Wormfood
fatpeoplestories,"I've lost about 35 pounds in the last year, which is still not enough. I am still fat. I have about 40 more pounds to lose, but today I just had a big realization.  

When I was at HomeTown Buffet today, I saw this mom who had four kids, and she was obese.  Her kids were throwing their food everywhere, and banging their forks against the table, and she wasn't doing anything.  I could tell that she was just too tired to take a control of her kids.  I also couldn't help but feel bad for the kids because I knew that the mother's eating habits would most likely pass down, which will lead the kids to have an unhealthy childhood.  

My own mother struggled with obesity, and I remember so often how she would have to pull over to take a nap because of her diabetes. Some days I had to wait hours to get picked up from school because my mom was too tired and had to take a nap.  And also just eating all the high glycemic carbs and sugars made me fat growing up. I was bullied, and it ruined my self esteem and my dating life.

In other words, I realized that losing weight is not just about me.  Its about living a longer life, and being able to be there for the people who need me. ","As a fat man, I have finally opened my eyes"

fatpeoplestories,"Remember [Jane](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/53s6ut/my_sisters_logical_leaps_to_justify_why_she/?st=jfhxipcd&amp;sh=28070d08) from this story? Brief summary about her, she's my cousin and somehow seems to be stuck in the mentality of a 6 year old. I do believe she most likely has some sort of mental illness, but since this is Asia, she has never been diagnosed.

If you believe this makes her pure, delightful and innocent, you have not dealt with enough 6 year olds. Because while yes, she's naive and sweet in her own way, like many 6 year olds, she also thinks she's the smartest, is stubborn as fuck, often very annoying in they way she pesters you, needs constant babysitting, and has the tendency to believe the world revolves around her. 

So I haven't talked to Jane in ages thanks to some nasty shit she said to her older sister (while thinking she was being wise &amp; benevolent...I'll post the story in the comments), who's the cousin I'm extremely close too. I was forced to hang out with her last Sunday since I was hanging out with my aunt, and I ended up with some dirt on my sister (a.k.a The Beast).

A while ago, I mentioned my friend, [Entrepreneur Dude](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/3z91i7/apparently_im_on_a_sex_site/cyk7pcj/?st=jfhxsyz8&amp;sh=248a4721) whose relationship my sister broke up. Well, right now he's dating a really, really rich heiress, so he's the subject of a LOT of gossip &amp; speculation. Jane, being a huge gossip, wanted to know if he's a gold digger, which is something a lot of people ask me once they know we're friends. I get it, the guy is extremely successful, good looking and charming, it's hard to believe he's a genuinely nice guy. He doesn't seem real. Even when a guy like him exists in fiction, the author can't resist making him a crazy emotionally abusive creep with the wrong idea of how BDSM relationships work (/cough 50 Shades /cough). 

I defended him and told Jane to stop listening to rumours spread by his bitter ex (a.k.a Silly Girl) and my toxic sister, who trashed him simply because she loves breaking up relationships. My aunt interjected going that there was no way my sister loves breaking up relationships, especially her *best friend's* relationship. 

Jane, in her usual brutal honesty, replied, ""Nope, I talked to Silly Girl. She said she broke up thanks to The Beast. The Beast was the one who convinced her to break up even though she wasn't sure.""

Apparently, Silly Girl is really regretting the breakup because in the 2 years since I posted that story, Entrepreneur Dude's business has gotten even more successful and he's starting a few more companies. The girl he's most likely going to propose to is also prettier and richer than her, so that probably stung. Oh, and to add salt to her wound, my sister changed her tune as soon as she found out how successful Entrepreneur Dude is, and insisted she had always told Silly Girl, ""He's such a catch that if you choose to let go of him, you'll never get him back.""

I remember her having a fight with Silly Girl over that. I have no idea why they're still ""friends"". 

If you think I sound smug about this incident, you're right. I totally am and I'm not sorry. Silly Girl really crushed him when she dumped him AND accused him of being a gold digger. She better regret that for the rest of her life. 

My aunt couldn't say a word. She always thought everything I said was a mixture of exaggerations and fantasy that came about from sibling rivalry. With Jane backing me up, it's a bit harder to cling on to that belief.

Jane had to continue, ""I think The Beast is just bitter because she badly wants a guy but no guy will ever be interested in her. That's why she feels the need to bring everyone down and hates seeing people in happy relationships. Like I'd tell her that this guy is interested in me, and she'll tell me that there's no way that's possible. She insists that no guy is genuinely interested in me, and they're only after my money!""

Ok. Jane can be annoying as fuck and I suspect she has some sort of mental illness. 

*However,* she's also extremely gorgeous and I know there's a lot of guys who don't have enough blood supply to function both their dicks and brains at the same time, and think it's a good idea to stick their dicks in crazy.

Jane has always been really pretty, except for a disgusting few years where she refused to shower because she believed Jesus is on his fucking way over and she doesn't want to be naked in the shower when the rapture happens. See? Crazy. I did tell her to just shower in a swimsuit, but she refused. 

I remember when she was in 1st grade, I'd always see kids following her during recess in that way kids tail people they have a crush on, without knowing why they're doing it or why they're so fascinated. Once, she plucked a flower saying she liked it, and suddenly, there was a horde of 1st graders plucking the damn bush bald. 

Now that she's all grown up, she's hot, rich and stupid. Of course there are loads of guys going after her. Not for the best reasons, but saying they were all there only for her dad's money is a stretch. There are people after her looks too. 

My sister doesn't believe it though. I remember her declaring to me, ""What does Jane have going for her? Look, I'm really hot. I may be fat, but my face is really gorgeous, I dress really well, and I have the BEST personality! Everyone wants to hang out with me and I get invited to the best events! You? You wear makeup well, I guess, and you're smart, so you have that going for you. But her? She's socially awkward, really stupid, and she can't dress at all! All she has going for her is her dad's money!""

Oh yes, Jane &amp; my sister are supposedly BFFs. They talk like this about each other. 

Jane talked at length about some unrelated topic because she often jumps topics haphazardly, just like a child. 

""You know, I wonder why she has such a big ego?"" she suddenly piped up cutting herself off mid-ramble. It took me a while to realize she hopped back to the topic of my sister. 

""Everyone wonders you know,"" she plodded on, ""All our friends just say her ego is too much. They don't know how she can keep praising herself that way. It's very gross and annoying. But also hilarious!""

Interesting. My sister loves telling me how popular she is, and looks down on me for not being ""in the society"". She says ""in the society"" unironically btw, it really makes me think she's going to dance naked in the woods with capes made of human skin. I like my close group of friends just fine. They may not all be filthy rich, but I can fucking trust them with my back, unlike the group of backstabbers my sister enjoys backstabbing back. Looks like they don't love her as much as she claims they do...

""Like my cousin and I were wondering, even we who get so many compliments about how beautiful we are don't have so much confidence. How does she manage it?"" Jane mused.

Ouch....

""And she keeps thinking guys are into her, and her reasoning is just crazy! Like she'll tell me all these stories and how it's the tone he's using or some look he gave, and I'm telling her I really don't think so. Like I'm there, and I'll tell her I saw the entire thing and it's not what she think it is, but she just tells me I'm stupid! Then when a guy is obviously checking me out, or messaging me all the time, and I tell her I think he's interested in me, she'll tell me I'm delusional,"" Jane continued.

""She'll keep arguing and she just doesn't want to accept I may be right. Like to the point where she's yelling over the phone at me! So I finally just had to say to her, **""Look, just because it never happens to you, doesn't mean it doesn't happen!""**

I nearly spat out my coffee and my aunt dropped her fork. 

""You said what?!"" I'm not sure who shouted it first, me or my aunt.

Holy shit, even for me, that's harsh. 

""Yeah, I had to tell her, ""Look, I know no guy is ever interested in you, so you don't know how these things work, but I'm trying to teach you here."""" Jane continued.

Hooolllyyy fuck.

""And she just hung up on me!"" Jane finished, genuinely believing that was the most irrational reaction ever.

fatpeoplestories,Mind linking some of the more epic stories? I realized most top stories users are deleted :(,Omg I just stumbled onto this sub and you guys are some of the funniest and wittiest writers. All hail FPS!
fatpeoplestories,"This happened way back in highschool but I remembered it when I read that fat cheerleader story and how a fatty put a huge damper on my short lived cheerleading experience.
My Sophmore year I made the basketball cheerleading squad by some miracle. Miracle because I am horribly uncoordinated,  I'm currently writing this with a huge bruise on my arm because  I fell in the shower yesterday, but I digress.
Anyway as anyone who cheerleads knows , the one of the perks to it is the cute outfit aka the flirty skirt in your school  colors with the matching shell top that you got to wear with pride. So when it came to the time to receive our I was beyond excited but my hopes were quickly dashed. 

Along with my clumsy self there was someone else who had no business being on the squad either , we will call her Fatdra. Fatdra was this large Latino girl, probably well over 200 with a brutish face and awful personality to boot. Fatdra and her brother had moved to our tiny town that fall,  bringing nothing but trouble with them. Seriously the whole family were troublemakers, bullies and honestly down right mean. Both of them were frequent attendees of detention and in school suspension, more then they attended class even. So how Fatdra made the squad is beyond me, I'm suspecting it was charity year.

So back to receiving our outfits, as our coach pulled out the outfits for the previous year my hopes of getting to wear the cute cheerleading outfit were quickly crushed when it became very apparent that Fatdra wasn't going to fit in the healthy normal sized shell tops. We begged the coach to let the rest of wear the shells and they could find Fatdra something else to wear but she said it wouldn't be fair to her so we couldn't.
I was devastated.

Our coach, sweet lady as she was tried to compensate us but after scouring all the cheerleading catalogues for anything in Fatdra's size, being denied by the school to order brand new shells and our first game quickly approaching, we ended up with a very sad alternative. Sleeveless white polo shirts with a blue color and a red generic cheerleading logo on the corner. 
It was so embarrassing that the squad kinda became a laughingstock at the games. It didn't help Fatdra still looked awful, her flab on her arms jiggling every move and lets not talk about her legs or her face. The saying about putting make up on a pig very much applied here. Plus Fatdra decided  my uncoordination was the reason we were a laughingstock and took it out on me frequently, making my confidence in abilities drop to like zero making me more clumsy.
On top of it all halfway through the season Fatdra had to ride the bleachers anyway because all of her ISS made her grades drop and she wasn't allowed to cheer, making all the hell we went through for her pointless. I still hate that she ruined my one chance at having a normal cheerleading experience.

Update: 
So after sifting through my memories of cheers, stressing over not messing up them up, working my butt off due to the sress, breath holding basketball game moments, long nights epecially when we traveled for away games and taking sips of my dad's Code Red ((yeah I know, Beetus juice but Code Red was huge in the early 2000s when it debuted so everyone and their dad drank it)) every time we got a break for a quick caffeine boost, I remember one other tidbit of entitlement. When Fatrdra announced she couldn't cheer due to her grades she was so flippant about, it was basically her version of teehee. Like it didn't matter to her all which really pissed us all off.",Squad All Suffers For Fatty
fatpeoplestories,"I decided to separate this since the [other story](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/88si93/where_my_sisters_magical_calories_came_from/) was getting too long. So this is another story from all the stories I got from Kristin (first introduced [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/83t4bu/let_me_force_people_out_of_their_seats_because_im/)). Note that my sister is full of (il)logical leaps, so you'll see a LOT of contradictory statements. 

Since Kristin is so sweet, my sister feels comfortable with letting her ego loose around her. My sister believes that she is smarter and more talented than almost the entire world, that she is destined to be a billionaire. That's why Kristin was shocked when I told her my sister once confided in me that she was considering quitting her job and moving to America, because Asian men apparently are ""prejudiced against fat"" and she's ""damn hot in America"". 

Please note that she lived in America for 5 years and couldn't get more action than a [pity fingering/dildoing](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/48wg30/what_partying_with_my_sister_is_like/?st=jfhns6lz&amp;sh=83696eeb). Nope, she never dated in all 5 years. 

She insisted the reason she was single in the US even though Americans think she's ""damn hot"" and aren't ""prejudiced against fat"" is because she hung out with all these rich Middle Eastern guys who ""respected"" her too much to date her. lolwut.

She loved gloating about how they wouldn't even address the hot girls clinging on to them by name, and would simply cock their finger to call them over or wave their hand to shoo them out. My sister bullshits so much though, I don't even know if this is true, because it's sounds like something she watched in a soap opera, then claimed it happened to her. 

Then again, I don't know....people don't believe anyone would [walk around naked on their period and drip a trail of blood all over the place](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/254fx6/i_have_a_morbidly_obese_sister_i_have_to_share_a/?st=jfhnye98&amp;sh=664845c8), leave bloodstained underwear around, refuse to flush her shit for days and keep reusing the same crusty dildo without ever washing it. I know I sound crazy when I tell stories about my sister, which is why I took [pictorial evidence](https://imgur.com/a/8E28g) (very NSFW &amp; NSFL) just to prove I'm not making all this shit up. I *know* I'm the one who sounds crazy if I tell these stories, which is why I usually don't, and relieve my stress by writing about it here. Even my then boyfriend didn't believe me until he stepped on globs of blood in the room I shared with my sister, which [horrified him into proposing marriage on the spot.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/54pucq/i_think_my_sister_was_attempting_to_hit_on_my/). Real life can be more fucked up than fiction.

Anyway...my sister believed that she's damn attractive personality wise because everyone is just drawn to her and she's always the life of the party. Well, an extremely large person shouting [absurdly sexual things](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/54pucq/i_think_my_sister_was_attempting_to_hit_on_my/) in the middle of the party will definitely draw attention and be the joke of the party. 

She also believes that she's damn gorgeous physically. She may be fat, but he has *fantastic* curves –her waist is tiny so she has a perfect hourglass figure. Note that my sister identifies her waist by poking her hand [deep inside her folds and deciding that's where her waist is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/57vxmb/my_sisters_therapist_introduced_her_to_haes/) She would repeat to Kristin nonstop that her face is ""damn pretty"", and I know Kristin's telling the truth, because ([my sister told me this too](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/40kugu/but_is_she_pretty/)). It's not the internet. We can see you and judge your attractiveness in real life. 

My sister firmly believes her ""pretty face"", her amazing fashion sense (ie. expensive bags she bought with what was supposed to be college tuition money with a muumuu), and *jewelry* (I shit you not), makes her irresistible.

Er, if someone says s/he's dating you for your gorgeous jewelry, I'm pretty sure you better not sign any life insurance with him/her as your beneficiary.

Oh yes, my sister is addicted buying overpriced jewelry. Until that conversation with Kristin, I've always thought she just did that because she was a hoarder...I didn't realize she actually thought they're the *key* to getting a man. 

The ironic thing is, she loooovvveeesss accusing any guy her friends are dating of being a gold digger.

Kristin unintentionally gave my sister a huge burn by going, ""What must she think of us who don't care about wearing jewelry or carrying expensive handbags? She must think it's a miracle we're both not single!""


But she has *another* reason why someone who's *such a catch* is still single and has never been in a relationship, even at 29. Apparently, it's because she has a ""masculine personality"" that intimidates men (wait what happened to ""prejudiced against fat"" and ""respected her too much""?). What does she mean by a ""masculine personality""? She meant independent, ambitious and successful. Yes, she's sexist as fuck. Though I'm not sure if that's more offensive to men or women...

I have no idea how Kristin listens to all this with a straight face.

fatpeoplestories,"So, just to clarify, I am a sex worker and I work in a country where it's legal to do so. Most of my clients are actually at a healthy weight or maybe off by 20 or 30 pounds, but I have an obese client and this is what I dealt with today (I don't care about a clients weight or appearance, money is money as long as you're safe).

So, this client is actually a pretty nice guy usually. He pays me well and takes me out to eat, he just so happens to have a lot of excess weight (think 350 pounds).

One of the incentives for him to see me is that I am someone who has lost 40 pounds (and counting) and that I could potentially help with weight loss. Now, I don't usually care about a clients appearance because that's not the business I'm in, but if someone is inspired by me and has expressed that they want to lose weight, I'll do whatever I can to help. I made it clear to him that he would need to change his eating habits and move more.

We go out today to a very nice steakhouse. His diet is mostly carbohydrates (as in, simple ones. He's not big on fruits and veggies ), so I figured that this would be a good opportunity to get more fats and protein in. I'm a relatively clean eater (I actually follow a ketogenic plan that was recommended by my doctor here), so there were plenty of options that were ok for me to eat, which he could benefit from as well.

I got the most beautiful lamb steak (seriously, it was bomb you guys. Grass fed lamb and it melted in my mouth.) and a side salad with olive oil.

He got a steak, which I was hopeful about...but then got a huge order of fries and mashed potatoes as sides. Kept going into the bread that was served as well.

He told me to be more firm with him in regards to food. I've tried being as polite as possible, but I had to tell him ""You were doing so well with your steak order, why do you keep ordering shit like fries?!""

His response: ""I just like this kind of food. I think you're just prone to liking these types of things. It's easier for you to lose weight. You've got good genes"".

Y'all. Part of why I got so fat to begin with is because I ate white bread non fucking stop. I love french fries. I love mashed potatoes. But I love being thin more, so I had to give that up.

I'm trying to think of a new approach to get him to eat healthier. Hopefully I'll be able to make a crack in the surface and get through to him.","Heard the ""it's in your genes"" excuse today."
fatpeoplestories,"A couple of days ago I posted about my weirdly aggressive and very insecure acquaintance, Thickette. I am avoiding her more and more, but it I'm not going to completely cut her out of my life right now because I don't want to risk messing up several life long friendships. I promise I'm not usually this lame. 

Thinking about Thickette made me remember something small that happened a while ago. I didn't really think much of it at the time, but the more I think about it the more bizarre it becomes.

I was molested as a child. I'm mostly over it, and pretty much all of my friends know about it. You don't have to say ""I'm so sorry!"" or anything.

Eventually, through our mutual friends, Thickette found out. I'm not bothered by her knowing. Normally, upon finding out what happened, my peers will either make an awkward attempt at comforting me or they'll nervously try to laugh it off. I understand those reactions. They don't bother me. Thickette, bless her heart, didn't do either. She looked me in the eye, laughed, and said ""Why would anyone want to rape you? You're skin and bones!""

Be partener-F, 5' 4"", best friend, ~115 pounds of gymnast -coxswain muscle. Yes, she has a crazy schedule. No, this is not what this post is actually about. 

Dont be judge-F, probably 5-6, 170ish pounds.

DO NOT BE THE OTHER TEAM

Topic was on car fuel emissions regulations. We prep a pretty solid case, feel like we have solid evidence, etc. Our opponents show up to the round 5-10 minuetes late-kind of rude, but we were a long way from prep. First girl is about 5-3, and maybe 180. Obviously overweight, but not unreasonable. Wears a fairly well-fitting pantsuit and blouse-standard attire. Second girl walks in. Very short–shorter than everyone in the room, which is saying something-and easily 280+ pounds. Wears a terribly fitting casual dress. Already, I am starting to worry when the opposite team cant fit at the connected chair-desks we have. Therefore, they end up halfway across the room.

So, round starts, we give our speech, yadda yadda. Opponents stand up, ignore our case, and start reading a K about weight discrimination. Seatbelts are apparently discriminatory, as they are less safe for people of size. Also say that our ""anorexic bodies"" are a product of fundemental societal expectations. Also, same for desks. 

We read several arguments against this, such as irrelevent, no link, no alt, reverse K on ""anorexic"", etc. They continue to ignore us, and in the neg block, massively obese speaker gets up. Starts talking about personal anecdotes. Tries to justify obesity by saying that her 347 pounds are justified by only eating about 350 calories per day extra, or one cookie. Then, surprisingly, lifts up skirt to reveal diaper, and says she doesnt fit in bathrooms at debate tournaments.

We conclude with our normal arguments, thinking we won that round for sure.

fatpeoplestories,"First time posting, long time lurker. Throwaway because my regular account is mostly about baking.

When I was in college I took an intro to pottery class as a fun elective my junior year. I was working at a certain restaurant where boobs, I mean owls, are the mascot. I always tried to keep it a secret, so no one would judge me, but one girl in my class use to work there. She was loud, and outed me in front of everyone. Just a casual “Oh I heard you work at owl restaurant! Is the management any better?” This is relevant because there was also a loud hamplanet girl in my class that was very vocal about feminism and fat logic. She did not like the fact that I worked at said restaurant, which I got a lot, and after she found out she would always look at me scowling. She also made comments about “conventional beauty standards, real women have curves...” She was very entitled and crazy rude. Her clothes were way too small for her and her butt crack, back and belly always showed. She also overshared about her sex life where “all body types” were welcome and she would “sleep with boys and girls”. I don’t have a problem with that it was just odd that our whole pottery class knew about it. Apparently she had a boyfriend and a girlfriend and was really good at “giving head both ways”. Obviously no filter on this ham. So one day she comes up to me and straight up tells me that “to her” I’m extremely unattractive and she would never “sleep” with me. I know it’s because I’m conventionally attractive (which she is against) and she was trying to make me feel insecure...didn’t work. Although, I was a little stunned by how rude it was. I just looked at her like wtf and kept  glazing my pot.  So, a few weeks later, I was sitting behind her and her butt crack and back was showing like normal. BUT ON THIS DAY, oh gosh I can still picture it. On this day, she had poop smears from her butt crack all the way up her back. Like she tried to get it off but she was too fat to reach and just smeared it everywhere. I just noted what wheel she was sitting at and NEVER sat there, but I laughed in my head all day. 

",Poop Ham
fatpeoplestories,"I just went back to the US and spent nearly two weeks hanging out with my college room-mate and close friend, Kristin (same one from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/83t4bu/let_me_force_people_out_of_their_seats_because_im/?st=jeqpueml&amp;sh=6655535e) story), so I got more stories about my sister, a.k.a. The Beast, from her. 

So Kristin is the sweetest person in the world and she's like a sister to me. As in, the generally understood definition of a sister. Not like the monstrosity that actually *is* my sister. We roomed together every year in college and we count each other as family, because we were pretty much inseparable throughout college. Because of this, Kristin ended up being ""friends"" with The Beast too. I put ""friends"" because, while Kristin considers my sister a friend and has helped her out so many times, my sister trash talks her (for brevity's sake, I'll post the story in the comments) and seems to look down on her. 


I personally think the reason The Beast is ""friends"" with Kristin is because Kristin's a very reliable and sweet person who can be counted on for help at any time, *and* because she thinks Kristin is no one she needs to impress, so she could eat as much as she wanted around her.


In front of people, my sister always puts on a show of appearing to eat very little. It's to the point where I've heard people wonder out loud how it was possible for her to be so huge when she eats so little. Clearly, they're the type of people who believe in miracles, because while my sister is a large monstrosity right now even after her [bariatric surgeries](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/5xsb43/my_sister_claims_she_got_gastric_surgery_to/?st=jeqpn5fj&amp;sh=76ca3337), she used to be even larger when she was in college. She kept lying about her weight so I have no idea how heavy she actually was, but there was a picture where my average sized cousin was jokingly trying to cup my sister's double chin in her hand and she failed as chin flab spilled over her hand. The Beast is 5'2, btw. 

She was living alone in the US without my parents to supervise her, so the only thing stopping her from eating as much as she wanted was her need to convince everyone that she ate very little and was simply suffering from the curse of those damn genetics...that somehow spared all her siblings and her mom. With Kristin though, she sort of lets loose. She still tried to appear to eat very little, but I guess with less effort. 


Apparently, when they went for dinners, she would typically order 3 additional meals (main course + appetizer) to go. It's to the point where most waiters will confirm multiple times with her, just because they thought there MUST be a mistake. 

The Beast would demur and claim that they were meals for her to eat throughout the week since she was sooooo busy and barely had time to feed herself. However, they would often watch movies at The Beast's apartment together after dinner, and as the night progressed, The Beast would keep eating the packed meals mindlessly to the point where she finished all of them. That's right, she would eat 4 meals for dinner + after dinner snack.

When they ate anywhere where food was meant to be shared like a tapas or dimsum place, The Beast would order mountains of food, using the excuse of wanting to introduce Kristin to a new dish. Once, the two of them ordered more than a family of 7 at a dimsum place. Of course Kristin couldn't even eat 10% of the food ordered, so The Beast would generously offer to keep all the leftovers. They split the bill evenly though. Yes, Kristin is too nice. The Beast probably convinced herself that calories were distributed according to how the bill was split. 

A few days ago, Kristin, my husband and I went to eat at my sister's favourite brunch place. The Beast used to brag to Kristin that she ate there so often, the waiters all recognized her. She would typically always get their famous French toasts as a dessert after her meal. The 3 of us decided that, knowing my sister's portion sizes, we better share the French toast between the 3 of us and just order 2 main courses &amp; a salad for splitting. At the end of the meal, we still had 2/3rds of a main course and 1/4 of the French toast left. I have no idea how she manages to eat a main course and French toast on her own. Then again, Kristin confirmed that my sister could typically finish Disney's jumbo turkey leg on her own. My husband and I shared one and we couldn't even finish it. And my husband is a pretty big guy who's nearly 200lbs. 

My sister still believes it's the fat genes making her fat though.",Where my sister's magical calories came from
fatpeoplestories,"Hello guys! I would like to start off by apologizing for my rambling and hyperbolic ridiculousness in my last post, and to thank those who gave it to me straight that I sounded like a chimpanzee on crack. Also, I heavily recommend Horizon: Zero Dawn and Far Cry 5, since I’ve spent about every waking moment playing them and not giving my people their noms! I wholeheartedly apologize. 

As us women well know, our time of the month can cause us to act...interestingly, to put it mildly. I combat the feeling of my uterus trying to rip out of my body ala the first Alien movie and form its own republic (for the men in the audience - imagine a sledgehammer on stimulants focusing on your nether regions - ok I’ll say it - YA BALLS) by drinking, however that doesn’t make for a very good reddit post. And yes I know I should go on BC, however I have tried it but it makes me gain weight, and I’m not trying to be the focus of my own stories. So, moving on!

In my previous drunken tirade (captain Morgan + Apple cider mmmm try it) I said that Dave and I were given another run with another Ham. 

What made this particular Ham special was their destination - a whopping two hours away. Which is great because our shift was supposed to end at 8, and it’s 6. So sure, we drop big homie off and then drive 2 hours home, gas the rig up, wash it off, return our toughbook, answer any stupid questions, clock out, and eventually return home 1-2 ish hours after our shift is supposed to end. 

Do you know who cares about this? The answer is: NOT DISPATCH. OR ANYONE EVER BESIDES THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO ACTUALLY DO THE WORK. 

I said around 1-2 hours? Lol. Try five. 

My company was known for being late. Is that our (meaning the actual working on the rig folk) fault? No. We get our assignments as dispatch feels the need to give them to us. And by “feel the need”, I mean “feel the need to be an asscooter.” Aka “here’s a 9am pickup!!!!” Which we receive at 9:30. So we get there as fast as we can, but every time we are bitched at for being late. 

Surprisingly, we were only 15 minutes late, as our previous Ham drop off was decently close to the next Ham pickup. Well how-de-do Ham(obv didn’t say that, we have at least the bare minimum of morals) Patient? We’re OP and BabyDave from X company here to take you to X place. 

“ABOUT TIME YOU PUSSIES SHOWED UP!” shrieks the mouth somewhere hidden in his octo-chin. 

Okay, well, first of all, *how dare you?* Pussies = cats and only in my wildest dreams am I a member of that fabulous species. 

Second of all, us being 15 minutes late is akin to winning the world’s worst lottery (like it’s great we’re almost on time but you’re also a ham and can’t walk so..). THIRDLY, fucking stahp. I’m paid barely enough to haul your wide ass around, and not nearly enough to haul your wide sassy ass. 

We apologize, proceed to ignore his bitching, and get him into the rig, lalalala skip down the yellow brick road, until...

“I need to shift. My *insert fat roll here* is sore.” 

Okay, I understand, my soccer career has inhibited me from sleeping on my left side due to multiple bone bruises on that hip. So I get it. Except he needs his junk in the trunk/drivers seat/the entire goddamned frame moved every 15 minutes. Of a two hour drive. 

Since Dave can’t move him by himself, I have to put on the lights (ok I’m not complaining about that, I love me some switching on ambulance lights), pull over, get in back, and call upon Herculean effort to shift this massive dude all of 3 inches. And then do it again, and again. 

Important: the distance he needed to move 90% of the time was something he could have done HIMSELF, but he whined until we helped. It was essentially what you’d do when you’re uncomfortable in a seat, shift your ass a bit and get more cozy on your big booty balloons. 

Finally, we go about 40 minutes without him needing to shift his shit, but he pleasantly filled the void with a nonstop tirade about our lateness and how long it was taking us to get him there. 

Full stop. How long it’s taking US to get YOU there? We would have been there an hour ago if it weren’t for your incessant need to scoot your badonk half an inch to the right. 

I again call upon Herculean effort to keep my mouth shut, I have a smidgen of an anger problem and had I not been at work, hell would have been released upon him via my vocal cords. 

He then chooses to make this comment: “I don’t know why you’re acting like I’m so hard to move. You probably have to help all your patients shift on the stretcher.”

NO WE DON’T BECAUSE MOST OF OUR PATIENTS ARE NOT AS DENSE AS A NEUTRON STAR. Jesus God. Dave was so upset his little baby EMT head nearly started to vaporize. To add to that, most of our patients are on a stretcher that has handrails on each side, which can hurt some people’s hips. Rude Ham is on the bariatric stretcher, which is like 4 feet of padded pastures for which you may graze upon. 

At long last, we arrive at the facility and wheel him to his room, where he proceeds to tell every person within earshot how horribly we treated him, how awful of EMTs we are, and how we should get our board certifications revoked. We don’t have board certifications, unlike my mom who is a doctor, I am not a doctor, and don’t have a board certification, or a hope of a fruitful life. I’M SORRY MOM I TRIED OK. 

Granted, most of those within earshot were either dead to the world/absent of will to live CNA’s, or people with mental disorders who probably thought a beach ball had wandered in and started shrieking its head off. 

We transfer the rude Ham to his bed and go to leave, when he makes the comment that puts the cherry on top of my fantastic day. 

“Hey OP-EMT?” 
Yes, sir? 
“You look like a boy. You should probably grow your hair out.”

The aftermath of this was somewhat a blur, I remember Dave crying and pleading while trying to haul me out of the room despite me having a foot and about 70 pounds on him, while the aforementioned hellfire spewed out of my mouth like a firehose with the pitch of a prepubescent teen boy who’s voice cracks on every other word. I probably could have restrained myself, but the smug look on his face after he said that made my blood turn to lava. 

Surprisingly, there were no complaints filed, maybe rude Ham gets off on insulting 23 year old girls, idk. I spent the ride home fuming in the back of the rig, sitting in the passenger seat was too small of an area to contain my fury. 

My brain went back into its primal state of KILL, I seethed, I mumbled to myself, I made rude hand gestures to the cabinets full of medical supplies. Time flew by through a sea of red, which was all I could see, and I ended up at home sometime around 11, where I was greeted by a little cat meowing at me, and the world was set right. 

Except for rude ham. Fuck that dude. Yes, I know I am mistaken for a boy at least once a day, but I think my hair is fabulous and I am a statuesque Amazonian goddess. So shut up and go think about all your fat. Christ. 

Cheers. Oh and happy Easter!

fatpeoplestories,"I went to walmart for a mini fan to put in my green house today. As im leaving I spot a planet handing an open 3 litre bottle of cream soda to her child who couldnt be more than 5 years old.  I felt like id just seen the rest of her life flash before my eyes. 

How can any parent think this is ok? Im going to be 30 years old next month and I drink soda maybe once every other week and only a small amount because the carbonation is overwhelming. But a 5 year old can just straight up chug out of a huge bottle like that? She is just going into life head on addicted to sugar. 

I fear for this childs well being. I am in shock from it all I think. I cant really articulate exactly how maddening this sight was. Poor kid.",Walmart planet
fatpeoplestories,"I wrote this last night but some sense told me to wait to make sure it made sense before throwing it up. Just... explaining the Good Friday and the drunk. 

We don't need a backstory so you jerks don't *get* a backstory. Diving right on in, let's go, double time. 

Husband's uncle married a good-looking very slender woman with multiple degrees. In theory she had a shred of intelligence. But I guess she was also a cocaine addict so that definitely didn't help. Not really sure why or how, but after they settled into the marriage with a couple of seal-the-deal kids, 110lbs somehow snowballed into a healthy 500lbs. He didn't think to divorce her up until that point because, well, the kids, and after she hit that point it was considered a disease and/or disability, and if he divorced her he'd be stuck footing her medical bill. 

This is a fragmented run down of the literal shitstorm that followed. 

She eventually got to ""wiping your ass with two towels tied together and seesawing it through your legs"" level of fat, and pretty much ended up near-immobilized in a  special order double-wide reside recliner chair, which she often just shit right in. This got to the point of leaking on the carpet, which, by the end of this all had to be torn out in its entirety because of its saturation with a whole new class of biohazard. On top of it all, she was a screaming banshee that would pitch ungodly temper tantrums over NOTHING. Tip a glass over? *OH MY GOD* the world was ending, hell was raining down and WHY DO YOU [her husband] HATE ME SO MUCH THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT. 

Eventually because this wasn't enough, she started to play their church (which she somehow still attended?) against her husband's whole family (which includes my husband and inlaws, obviously). 

She would demand that her husband leave his job multiple times a day to bring her fast food. One such order included 2 whopper meals, 2 big mac meals, and 2 checker burger meals because she couldn't decide which fries she wanted from which place. Her husband had to leave work in the middle of the day, drive to three different places, and bring her $40 worth of lunch. They got in a screaming match about it which my husband overheard. Apparently she was beyond rabid that he had gotten the wrong sauces. In a fit of rage she smashed the entire lunch into the carpet. Then, because she would NEVER throw away ANY food, she picked it out of the carpet and still ate it. Yes. That carpet. He got written up for poor work performance after this incident, too. 

Some of this shit I just have to copy/paste from the online chat my husband and I are having about this because he is being much more eloquent than I am also we are both drunk as fuck yeah go Good Friday!! Green is him. 

&gt;All I can remember is her car all of my life was unpleasant, I hated going anywhere with them because her car had that very unique stench of McDonalds ""couch fries"". You know, the smell of a fat person's car whose favorite food place is Mick Dicks Fried Taters and Chicks.

&gt;She had a big ass brown lincoln car that she used to drive when I was growing up, and the day we sold it for scrap it legit sat down on the driver side about 6 inches lower than the passenger side on the front. She drove the car for so long that the front suspension had worn out before any of the other 3 of 4 points did.

&gt;Now that I think about it, the whole reason I ever knew how to relate to the ""stale couch fry"" shit that I've seen online is because HER CAR IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE RELATED TO FUCKING HIDDEN FRIES GALORE. It's the epitome of a fat person EATING SO MUCH SO FAST THEY DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT A FEW, OR EVEN A HANDFUL OF FRIES AT A TIME. They. Were. Everywhere. In every crack, corner, cushion, fold of fabric, everywhere was a fucking stale fry. I'm not even kidding.

&gt;it's either the ""I have too many kids that I haul around in my minivan/suv/soccermombus and kids meals are a giant hit with the kids so yayyy kids meals every monday tuesday thursday and friday nights kids!!!!"" or the other option ""I'm fat as fuck."" Or a combo, ""I'm fat as fuck with kids wut bout it.""

Segway

&gt;Wait have you ever heard a SUPER FAT person sneeze?!?!

&gt;It's absolutely not what you would expect

&gt;So when I sneeze, for instance, it's a ""AHHH CHOOOO...Ohhhh....Ffewww"" usually followed by a quick other ""AHHHCHOOO ffeeww""

&gt;Hers. Will always be burned into my memory. Not just because she FOUGHT them back so hard....like to the point of grasping her face with her whole hand and holding her breath

&gt;but when she finally actually SNEEZED it was a......achchchCHCHCHCHCHCHCHCICICICCOCOCOooooooooooooOOOOOooOOOOooOOOoOOO"" like a fucking chipmunk trying to pass a peach pit in a massive shit. that's what it sounded like. A little girl going CHICHICHICHICHICHI fighting it until it was motherfucking CHO. Followed by more face grabbing, holding breath, and another Ahhhch.ch...ch...ch.chhchchchCCHCHCHCHCHCHCOoOOOOOOOooO then an imediate ""WOAHHH"" like an ungodly gorilla fronting a shit christian metal band. when it was CHO I mean fucking CHOOOOHHHHH followed by a ""bless me Jesus, WHooo!""

I wish I could be half as poetic. 

Apparently the sound of her rocking her planet ass back and forth out of a metal chair sitting on concrete was also a delightful experience all round. Enjoy clenching your teeth to that one. She also did utter (udder?), STUPID shit on a regular basis. For example, she drove up to my husband while he was visiting home (we come from different countries) and told him to give her ""at least two week's warning before he got married so that she could plan it."" … we had already been married over a year…. 

That's all of the bullshit we can think of at the moment, being a little on the not side of sobriety, but if I think of more little stupid shit I'll add it in the comments or as a new post down the line. At any rate, with all the fat nasties aside, she turned into a really fucking evil person. 

She started switching out her husband's pain medications with others that would interact in a damaging and eventually deadly manner. She used her sisters to go out and obtain certain medications from the doctor and would swap the pills out. He was so fucked in the head by this point he didn't notice, and everyone assumed he was still just abusing drugs and alcohol. Really his brain was just… turning to mush. Why? Because she'd racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt in his name and logically if he's dead no problem, right? That's a sane person solution?

So the family found out what was happening and kicked the fatty out/immediately lawyered up and launched a whole lawsuit. She tried to claim my husband was stealing prescriptions to sell and all sorts of fucked up accusations. Basically tried to rip the family to shreds because she got caught. 

Her ex (yay) husband has had a really horrible tough road and multiple surgeries but he's actually recovering alright, surprisingly. His two daughters were furious when he cut mommy's credit cards that were taken out in his name and given to them and have not been by since she was ratted out. 

Then before the lawsuits could go anywhere she caught the flu and died. And everyone was kinda just left standing in the wake of this hurricane wondering what the fuck just blasted through their lives. ",Oh the Huge Manatee
fatpeoplestories,"So, I have a friend. He's a great guy. One of those people you can talk to about anything. He'll listen and he'll offer solutions or a shoulder to cry on. He'll probably make a few jokes to lighten your mood. An overall nice, nice, nice person. 

Now, I've known him for four or five years. We became friends in the first year of college, and are now finishing our final year (fifth year). In the years I've known him, he's always been tubby but he's seriously gained weight! 

Earlier, he was maybe 85 or 90 kilos, at about 5'10"". He looked fat but okay. Now, he's at about 110 kilos. 

A couple of years ago, he started complaining about his knees hurting. Our college campus doesn't allow cars inside. So we have to walk to the gate. Unless if we have medical issues. This guy has bribed/made friends with the security people, who let cars for him in. So that he doesn't have to walk even the 250 metres to the college gate. 

And he eats and eats! Once a week, every week, like clockwork, he'll call me and ask me to go out. He's got many many more friends apart from me (due to him being a great person otherwise) and he goes out for meals nearly every day of the week. 

And he won't avoid the butter, or carbs, or what have you. A meal must be finished off with dessert. When I stopped drinking sugary drinks and started substituting most of my snacks with fruit, he made noises about how he really doesn't like fruit (!) and about how I shouldn't fatshame myself. 

A couple of weeks ago, he told me he's been having issues with appendicitis. I don't know how true this is. But he went home over this weekend for a medical appointment. The doctors don't want to operate, and have told him to rest and take it easy. He's making dinner plans from home! 

I asked him if he wants to go for a walk. I like taking walks, and the area around our campus is lovely. I'm a fast walker, but can't go very long because of certain issues. But I've built up my strength and now can walk up to two or two and a half hours with no problems. 

In any case, we went for a walk. Once. In January. There, he would get two steps ahead of me and then make fun of me for being ""slow"". And, at the 35 minute mark, he just gave up!

He's not come for a walk since. Now, he's saying his appendix hurts and so he can't walk. That's fine, I understand. But what the hell happened to you all these days? I don't know if the appendicitis is real or it's just a ruse. 

I don't mind cutting down on meals or walking like three or four times a week to ensure that I remain healthy. 

I don't want to judge his lifestyle. He's a close friend. I'm worried about him. ",I'm worried about my friend.
fatpeoplestories,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I've recently been becoming more familiar with a certain individual who I hope is r/fatpeoplestories/ material.

Me: 16, female. Approximately 5'3 and 93 lbs. That may sound bad, but I've been to a ton of doctors about my weight and they've all said I'm not too skinny, just ""petite."" I am considering putting on a little more weight, but that is unimportant in the context of this story.

Thickette: A friend of a friend. Also 16 and female. Approximately 5'4 and 200 lbs. Always refers to herself as ""thick."" She is not thick. She is very obviously obese.

Over the course of several months, I've been spending more and more time with Thickette. It was almost unavoidable due to us having several mutual friends and a couple of classes together. I didn't mind it at first. She seemed nice enough, and she can be pretty funny. 

Something I noticed right away about her, however, is that once she forms an opinion she will not change it. It doesn't matter irrational her argument is, she will never, ever admit that she is wrong. She once tried to convince me that every college in the US was equally good. 

At some point along our pseudo-friendship, Thickette became convinced that I was very unhealthy, and that my health can only be fixed by eating more food. She frequently jokes about how I'm ""dying."" Keep in mind that I run, hike, and do pilates on a daily basis. I'm not super bony. I have a visible six pack. I may not be the healthiest person on the planet, but I am certainly not dying. Thickette finds a way to take everything I say as an indication of my poor health.   

Our conversations often go something like this:
Me: ""It's cold out here""
Her: ""I'm not cold. You're just cold because you barely eat""

Thickette likes to prove how strong she is. She sometimes will  ""playfully"" punch me, and if I flinch or move or anything she'll say something like ""Oh, I'm so sorry! I forgot how flimsy you are!"" I'm not flimsy. Obviously if someone over twice my size punches me as hard as they can I'm going to flinch. She also regularly challenges me to arm wrestling competitions and is filled with joy when she (just barely) beats me. When I pointed out that she has an advantage because her arms are three times bigger than mine, she got upset.

When she's not busy telling me about how bad my health is or asserting her dominance, Thickette likes to ask weirdly invasive questions about my body. She recently asked me if I shave my legs (I do) and if I have a period. She was very surprised to find out that skinny girls can, in fact, menstruate. 

The other day she asked how much I weigh. I told her. She looked appalled. ""No wonder you look like a baby! At your height, you should weigh at least 170 pounds!"" She insisted. ""You need to start eating like I do so you can be normal sized like me!"" I told her that I'd seen doctors about my weight and they said I was fine. I told her that several of our mutual friends were a similar size to me and were also perfectly healthy. She wasn't buying it. 

Thickette then noticed my fitbit. Her face turned red. ""Why do you have a fitbit?!"" She yelled, spit flying from her mouth. ""You're already skinny! You don't need to walk! Being skinny is really unhealthy!"" 

The saddest part about this is her parents are doctors.",Not being obese is very unhealthy
fatpeoplestories,"be or don't be Me and My Friends™ - heights and weights irrelevant, hobbies irrelevant, lives irrelevant. story isn't about us. 

definitely don't be Rotunda - short, round, and stout. extremely touchy feely, and probably dreams of food at night. known for berating me on my food choices, taking food off my plate, or putting her hands right next to my butt if we're sitting next to each other.

This is the story of Rotunda and one of our university cafés. (stay tuned for extra doughnut holes at the end) 

Frequently before class, my friends and I sit in this one particular cafe and share food and stories. 

Rotunda was someone we knew as an acquaintance. she ran in our social circles but we weren't particularly close with her. if it isn't evident why, it will become evident why. 

Rotunda was a very difficult girl to deal with. She had no respect for personal boundaries, she will consistently and constantly call or text for no particular reason, and what I hated most of all was how she liked to tell me if I keep eating I'll get fat. Pot, meet kettle. 

The incidents began early in the year and only escalated. 

at first it was only Typical Rotunda Things that went on, such as approaching random people and begging them to buy her food. some days she'd even be lucky enough to walk away with two or three different items of food she had begged off two or three different people. 

it was something she's done before and it didn't surprise me. considering her parents had recently put her on a diet and was demanding receipts for every food item she bought, this was a good way to get around that. 

But then it would come to escalate. 

she began to steal from the university Cafe. 

it was small at first, a yogurt here or a cola there, but slowly over time it began to get bigger and bigger. some days she'd walk away with more than one bag of gummy bears, sandwiches, multiple drinks. anything that wasn't hot or a-la-carte. 

(no, we never confronted her over this. I'm contemplating telling her parents but we aren't needlessly seeking out drama. we've informed the cafe workers but there isn't much they can do.) 

and... that's pretty much the end. she's still stealing food from the cafe and we're still watching in morbid fascination while she sits shamelessly near the cafe and shovels the stolen food and the food she's begged off other people in her mouth. literally shovel. spoon in one hand and using her fingers with the other. rapidly. 

and honestly I wouldn't have an issue with what she does, if not for... well, all the things she does. 

and so to buff up this main course I bring you a little platter of desserts. 

(dessert 1 - Rotunda and my goddamn dinners) 

sometimes we go out to eat with Rotunda. 

not a big deal; it's not as if I hate her or anything like that. I just dislike when she touches me or when she tells me in gonna get fat when I eat an extra roll of sushi. 

and another thing I do mind is when she takes. my. food. 

each and every time. 

we'll be eating and enjoying each others company, when I see those grubby fingers ""sneak"" their way towards my plate. reprimands don't work, she'll so it again minutes later. and she doesn't do or to anyone else either, just me. 

after the meal she inevitably insists we all go to the bus station together and walks at literally 1mph, making us miss multiple buses. IT'S 9PM ROTUNDA I WANT TO GO HOME. 

(dessert 2 - not a fat person story just a bad person story) 

sometimes I like to play Uno. 

actually most of the time I like to play Uno. and I like to play Uno at school inside the private offices that are reserved for club executive members. 

one day I am playing Uno inside an office with my SO and his friends. all is well. 

that is, until Rotunda walks past and sees me.

then all hell breaks loose. 

she starts banging on the door and windows and screaming at me to let her in. then she starts banging and screaming at the nearby offices to let her in. 

I’m starting to contemplate opening the door for her just so she'll calm down, but SO's Friend stops me. 

""she always does this, just ignore get"" he says. 

so I do. 

the banging and screaming gets louder, and finally dissolves into pleas and sobs. then she gets angry again and calls security. 

security is on our side. screaming ""THEY WOULDN'T LET ME IN!!! I KNOW THAT GIRL MILKEE!!!!!!"" isn't really the best defense, even if she does know me. 

I haven't witnessed another meltdown like that in awhile but sometimes I hear whispered stories about the girl that tries to break into offices. 

(dessert 3 - DON'T LICK YOUR PLATE AFTER YOU EAT ROTUNDA) 

title sums it up. 

(dessert 4 - Rotunda and the all you can eat sushi brunch) 

once upon a time, Rotunda and Co go to brunch. it is an all you can eat sushi brunch. 

we sit down and they bring us our paper slip to order our food. all is well. 

actually, all is not well. 

Rotunda had decided to get a million bazillion of each item. even with her history of eating enough food for a small third world country, we didn't think she could finish all that sushi. 

it was... a LOT of sushi. 

we reminded her again and again she was on her own. we were NOT eating her leftovers, she had to finish EVERYTHING she ordered. 

she reassured us again and again or was fine and she could finish it. 

three guesses if she finished it or not. 

Friend's BF refused to help finish the meal. he was cutting, and we understood he had a daily intake goal to meet. 

Friend and I looked at each other and at the situation. I shrugged. can't eat anything with fish or mayo because of allergies. everything Rotunda ordered had mayo. 

it was up to her. 

Friend took a couple pieces, and told Rotunda since she ordered so much she had to finish it. 

Rotunda begrudgingly agreed. 

then the antics began to happen. 

she would stuff the sushi into her mouth and excuse herself to the washroom. eventually she stopped trying to be sneaky, and took the entire tray with her to the washroom. 

we guiltily paid and left once the table was cleared. 

(dessert 5 - Rotunda and the curry) 

I’m sharing a curry bowl with a couple friends when Rotunda walks in. 

with her she had a bag of McDonald's and a doggy bag of fried rice from a nearby noodle shop. 

she sits with us and begins to eat. 

two burgers, 20 pieces of chicken nuggets, and a bowl of fries rice later she eyes our unfinished curry. 

""can I have that?"" she asks. 

""no way!"" we answered, ""we're still eating."" 

she grumps and she pouts and she whines, but when she sees we weren't going to give up our curry or even let her share with us, she stomps out. 

minutes later she returns with her own curry bowl. which she eats. all of it. 

""I’m gonna go get some upon,"" one of the girls say, and Rotunda pipes up ""I’m going too!"" 

(final dessert - The disappearing food) 

the club I’m exec in currently shares a big office with two other clubs. we all have our own space and do not invade one another's. 

our club had a snack stash, which my Friend ™ and I finished. chocolate chips, yogurt chips, and little powder candies - all gone. 

Rotunda was devastated. 

""sorry Rotunda,"" we chided, ""we'll buy more later"" 

she seemed to accept it and the issue was forgotten. 

until a couple weeks later, when the other clubs began to notice that their own food stashes were going missing. 

couple days later we confronted the culprit as she ate from a bag of chocolates that didn't belong  to us. 

""I THOUGHT THESE WERE OURS!!"" she protested. 

""these aren't even in our section of the room, Rotunda"" 

she hemmed and hawed and finally put back the bag of chocolates. 

It was recommend to the other exec team not to eat from the bag anymore. Rotunda was known for licking her fingers after every bite and putting  it back into the bag.

for now, dinner is finished. 

stay tuned for more Rotunda stories, as there inevitably will be more. we will be doing a round table to discuss what past events have occurred that's worthy of being remembered, as these are all recent occurrences. 

until next time!

fatpeoplestories,"There’s a quite large young woman who works as a receptionist at a medical office I went to today. She was sitting, so I can’t be certain of her height, but her spread was... impressive, to say the least. She had one of those bariatric office chairs, and she was spilling over both sides. Easily 200kg would be my guess.

While I was wrapping things up with another office worker, I heard the large lady complaining to a third office lady  about how warm it was today. It was causing her to sweat, which caused her “to rip a little.” She then proceeded to lift her shirt to show the third office woman and I glanced over as well.

Big mistake. Huge. It will haunt me for the rest of my days.

Her fupa folds looked like there was some kind of nasty (yeast would be my guess) infection spreading across her entire lower section, more concentrated in the folds. I’m pretty sure some of it was on the arms of the chair that dug into her sides.

She looked so young as well. Early to mid 20’s would be my guess. It makes me so sad. Does anyone else feel sad when they see such young people so morbidly obese?",FUPA Galore
fatpeoplestories,"Hi there! 

Me: F, 26, 5'10"", 160ish. I swam at an elite level in college. I did my time being super fit with really low body fat percentage, I've been enjoying my retirement so I put on a few pounds. Not much, as I still swim masters, spin, elliptical, yoga, and hike a LOT in the summertime. The point is that I do still look fit but I know I have a few extra inches :)

HamFamily: two kids, both moons, both under 10. Dad with a typical dad bod, maybe 6 ft and 250? Mom is short and pretty big, I'd estimate 5'3"" and 300 lbs. 

I volunteer coach for our local swim team. We live in a relatively rural area and it's the only pool in the county. It's only a 4 lane pool (6 or 8 is standard) so when it's swim practice time there are no leftover lanes for lap swimming. It's a very small team so practices are only an hour long. The pool is next to the little kiddie pool with fountains and stuff, with a small lazy river and a larger hot tub. 

Usually there's a ton of kids and families hanging around the kiddie pool area in the evenings when we practice. Dads are in the hot tub, moms are watching the kids and making sure they don't drown or kill themselves on the fountain equipment. It's all usually pretty chill and cute to watch. We don't technically allow food but if they have a small snack to hand the child it's not really a big deal. Example: a carrot and hummus. No mess, easy for the kid to chomp on and keep playing. 

Well this family comes in and takes over a table, that's normal. The kids start playing, dad goes to the hot tub, mom starts to come over to the lap pool. Keep in mind, I am NOT a lifeguard. I am there to coach the kids. She starts to get into a lane where there are kids clearly in the middle of practice! And she starts telling them to move over! It's not the first time an adult tries to take over a lane so I go over and politely tell her this time is reserved for practice and is not open right now. She turns red and I swear starts blowing up like Aunt Marge in Harry Potter. 

""Listen here, child! I pay for this membership and I deserve pool time just as much as the team! I have to exercise I do it every day here! (whatever lady I've never seen you I practically live here but ok...) You are preventing me from doing the only exercise I can do! I'm disabled, you are harassing a disabled person!"" 

I know this is way too much than I'm willing to deal with right now so I just turn around and get the head lifeguard to deal with her. He manages to get her out of the lap pool and into the little lazy river. A lot of people use that as resistance exercise and it works really well. 

She gets in...and can't swim! She can touch the bottom, it's only like 3 feet deep. But the tiny bit of resistance is too much for her and she keeps ""falling"" and blubbering and rolling around and around. I admit, I felt really bad but I did chuckle a tiny bit. It was kind of funny, but that is mean and I don't really mean it. As annoyed as I get at people coming in and ""swimming"" and taking up the whole lane when it's really just doggy paddle, hey, it's movement and good for you. Something is better than nothing. 

The part that made me think about posting this though...she gets out after 10 minutes of her ""workout"" and calls the kids over. She had brought a huge Yeti cooler and just keeps pulling out bags and bags of food. It looked like they went to the grocery store before a camping trip or something. 

""Come over, kids! Swimming burns a lot of calories you need to keep up your energy!"" And they all start chowing down on food. Fruit snacks, those peanut butter oatmeal energy bite things, granola bars + clif bars, gatorade energy chews, oh my goodness I couldn't believe how much food those kids ate! Not to mention the mom! And all that was clearly marketed for ""healthy"" snacks during exercise but like, you're supposed to eat ONE, right? I have a clif bar before hiking a summit and I'm usually good until that evening. 

And the food was EVERYWHERE. Wrappers were thrown to the side, fruit snacks dropped and stepped on, just a mess. The kids kept going to play and then they'd come back and eat some more. A fruit snack pack and granola bar more. As they had taken a table next to the lap pool I finally had to go over and ask them to clean up and pointed out the big ""NO FOOD IN POOL AREA"" sign. 

""Excuse me miss fit and healthy?! You can't tell me what to eat and not eat (I wasn't). You can't deprive my children when they are burning tons of calories! Just because you eat rabbit food doesn't mean you can tell me what to do!"" 

This lady has never seen me eat, doesn't know me, and yet grossly insults me. I'm just done. I go to the head lifeguard again and ask the family be removed. The dad wasn't happy to leave the hot tub but they did leave with much grumbling. This was all less than the hour of swim practice I was there for. Sheesh...some people. 

**Also, everybody knows that Michael Phelps didn't actually eat 12,000 calories a day right? That was a bogus article that got popular and it's nowhere near true. He ate a lot but not that much. I trained at that level. I know. It drives me nuts when people are like, ""swimming burns so many calories! I need to carbo load!"" Well, yeah, but not THAT much. *end rant*",Hams at the pool
fatpeoplestories,"Hello my lovely little buttery croissants! It is finally time for my first actual post and it’s more of rant/I need some advice. I hope this is hammy enough, if not please let me know mods!

So I live away from home and if there’s one thing I miss more than anything else about living at home it’s my family dog (let’s call him Fluff). I love that dog to pieces and every time visit he gets at least 100 hugs and 10 nose boops. I’m the one who picked him out when I was a little batsandrainbows and I would never trade him for anything. 

Anyways! The problem lies in that my mother. She is probably around 5 foot 4-5 and weighs maybe around 250? It’s really hard to tell her weight it’s quite literally all in her gut and she looks like she is preggers with triplets. My mother is a terrible pet owner. We have two dogs Fluff and Tiny. She has spoiled both of these dogs to where Fluff has to be constantly eating and Tiny is a nervous wreak that barks if the wind rustles the leaves the outside and even goes to the bathroom inside if nervous enough. She lets them do whatever and has never properly trained them.  I will be focusing on Fluff as Tiny is not really my dog and he came into the family right about the time I left home. 

Need to outside? Throw them out there. Play? Lazily throw a toy down the hall then get mad at him when he wants it to be thrown again. Play more? He must be hungry!!!. This beautiful dog is a breed of dog that should be lean and athletic. Now he’s 50 lbs overweight. When he goes outside with no one else to make him active he just lays there. 

Due to a very nasty situation I have no communication with my mother and this makes my issue with Fluff even worse. I’m not at the family home anywhere and I haven’t seen Floof in ages. I’m sure he’s still gaining weight though as my mother has always seen love=food. And since I don’t want her love at the moment then that means Fluff gets allllllll the love.

FPS I am so very worried about my mother sending Fluff to an early grave, but I feel like I can’t really do anything. When I did speak to her, time and time again I tried to explain to her that Fluff needed to be outside more and needed a lot less food. Her protests? “Bu-but he’s always so hungry!” ...no, you just leave his bowl constantly full. Seriously it gets even close to empty and she is there filling it right back up (it’s one of those bowls that has a tower that always has food in it). And the table scraps, dear sweet baby Jesus in a tiny little manger, the table scraps or just not watching food in plain sight. “Oh but he like human food! And he’s so hungry!” And the exercise? “Well I can’t go for walks outside, it hurts my knees.” Then lose weight “I’ve tried. Just not meant to be.” 

My father exactly can’t exercise Fluff as he is quite busy tending to work. I can’t as I don’t feel comfortable being in the same room with her and I live pretty far. Should I just take him away? Do you think that would hurt him? Since my parents are really his owners I feel like I would be taking him away from people that he loves. This dog deserves so much more than he’s getting from my ham of a mother, but I don’t want to hurt him even more by me thinking I can help. Is there any way at all that I or anyone could get through to her that she is slowly killing our dog? 
",My Ham of a Mother is Ruining My Dog
fatpeoplestories,"I apologize for formatting, it’s my first time making a big post on Reddit, and I’m on mobile.

The first time was the day after I had my wisdom teeth pulled, I hadn’t eaten anything the day I had my wisdom teeth pulled, because I was getting sedated and because I slept the rest of the day. Now that I woke up and it was time for dinner, my father decided to make half the macaroni and cheese we planned prior, so he could cook some pork, which I couldn’t eat. Fast forward to when everyone is eating. I was half-way through my first bowl, chewing slowly and carefully because my gums were very sore. Mini-moon gets up after downing a bowl of macaroni and a big piece of pork. I thought he was getting more pork. I was technically correct. He got another piece of pork, and the rest of the macaroni and cheese, to the point where the bowl, which was a good size bigger than the rest of our bowls, was very close to spilling because it was so full. I noticed to late to say something, because by then he had already drowned it in ranch, salt, and pepper.

The 2nd time was the next day, I walked down to the local grocery store and bought some jello, because my mother was going to get some big ass cupcakes. I can barely open my mouth enough to eat it on a good day, so I certainly couldn’t do it two days after I got my wisdom teeth pulled. I put the jello in the fridge around one, so it would be ready after dinner. Now I made two packages of the big jello boxes, so I had an assload of jello. It would have lasted me at least a whole week if I ate big portions. I take a nap, and when I come down all the jello is gone, and the left over ham from three days prior was being stuffed into the gullet of the Moon.

I should note he’s been eating 50% during this because he’s on a diet. This is his idea of a diet.",Mini-moon brother eats his food then my food. Twice.
fatpeoplestories,"I live in a very affluent suburb, and it's very infrequent that you'll encounter hams here. Probably 98% of my school is not overweight. 

The other 2% are kids definitely very much over 25 BMI. One of them is cheerleader ham.

Cheerleader ham is about 200 pounds and shorter than me by about five cm, so probably 5’3 to 5’4 sounds right. She carries her weight well, so her face is not pudgy, but her body is much larger than her head.

Cheerleader ham made history by being the first fat girl to make the cheerleading team. This achievement, unfortunately, is marred by her repugnant personality and the fact that I have no small doubt that her mother, who is a prominent member of the PTA, had a hand in her acceptance. It is also very painfully obvious that she can not cheerlead. When other girls flip through the air or carry each other, she stands on the sidelines and waves her pompoms sadly.

Because of cheerleader ham's weight/appearance, as well as her less-than-stellar personality, she is not very popular with boys. This has led her to be almost famously desperate for a date to social events.

Our story starts when on our annual winter formal dance, cheerleader ham posted on the asking Fb page ""hmu for a date 😘"".

She had one reply: band kid.

Band kid was the stereotypical clarinet player—he mostly kept to his group and was pretty quiet. He wasn't bad looking, but he wasn't super good looking either. Like most clarinet players, he was pretty forgettable.

So when band kid responded to her comment, it was super big news/gossip in our school. His reply had a like count in the high sixties/seventies the last time I checked.

The thing was: he didn't ask her out. Apparently a friend did it as some kind of cruel joke. Still, band kid, being a decent fucking human, took it as his duty to follow up on the comment.

That turned out to be a huge mistake.

Cheerleader ham, who had at that point been starving for attention, took it that band kid had asked her out. In the days before the formal, she came into the band building and invaded his friend group during lunch, started texting him incessantly, and constantly pressured him to stop talking to other girls.

He still took her to formal though. I don't know what kind of endurance he had. It was kind of funny to watch the two together whenever she dragged him off to have alone time—he would sit there silently while she talked or snapchatted her ""friends"".

She posted on her instagram a picture of the two of them at formal ""so much in looooove"", how she was blessed to have met him, the standard try-hard IG posts.

Still, band kid endured. Kids straight up teased him for taking her, the poor guy.

Then came his breaking point. Band kid had this weird flirting/friendship/Bff/sibling thing with a colorguard girl. Never official but the two of them were super close, either romantically or platonically. 

Cheerleader ham tells him: “Stop talking to Girl, she's a huge bitch and doesn't like me, she's an ugly bitch, etc. etc.""

Band kid apparently just snapped right then and there. Idk the details but she was crying at the end and it was just a huge mess.

So then cheerleader ham went to her mom, who is a huge PTA
member, and just complained that band kid and colorguard girl were bullying her. The mom made a fuss and then the principal got involved and eventually the whole school had an assembly about bullying.

Band kid got IS suspension bc apparently him taking her to the dance was considered ""bullying” bc he didn't actually like her and the whole school viewed it as a joke. A lot of people protested but the admins didn't GAF.

Cheerleader ham did not secure a date to the next dance, Sadie's, where girls ask guys out. Later, she made a bitchy fb post about how her friends were snakes and how she was the pitiful victim, boohoo, she was bullied, etc.

As for band kid, his parents were so upset with the IS suspension that he was banned to going to dances ever again.",The tragic tryst of cheerleader ham and band kid.

fatpeoplestories,"Hello r/fatpeoplestories; it’s me, your long time lurking, first time posting friend Mrs. Nixon herself: tr1ckydicky. 

BACKGROUND INFO
———————————
I’ve always been a bit heavy, maybe on the light end of the moon spectrum. I’m 5’7 185lbs down from almost 200, but I’ve never EXPERIENCED fat logic irl. Until today that is. 

THE REAL STORY
—————————
Picture this, it’s mid day and Tr1cky realizes the family needs some groceries. She piles into the car with her family and heads to (common northwestern American grocery store.) 

At the checkout, FatherTr1cky is paying, and Tr1cky is like “shit dude I have to pee.” 

Tr1cky should have expected unfortunate things to happen, as they do in supermarket restrooms. 

Nonetheless, Tr1cky does her business and goes to wash her hands, when a scootypuff bound ham emerges from the handicapped stall. The ham is sweaty. The ham is launching an olfactory assault that the US government would envy. Tr1cky speedwalks to the sinks. 

Tr1cky is washing her hands as she sees the ham slowly approaching in the mirror. Tr1cky doesn’t stare, MotherTr1cky didn’t raise an asshole. The ham however, does stare. It stares deeply, with unblinking eyes, sunken into a balding head of unidentifiable fatty features, directly into Tr1cky’s soul. 

Tr1cky fears for her life, but she is brave. She’s washing the last bit of soap off of her hands when the ham opens it’s eating orifice. Tr1cky is coming to terms with her fate, and wonders how her family will react to her being devoured in a dimly lit grocery store bathroom; when the ham speaks. 

“No, it’s fine. I can open the door myself.”

Tr1cky turns, and faces the ham in all its glory.

Tr1cky: “I’m sorry, what?”
Ham: “can’t you see I’m disabled? Millennial bimbos like you have no respect for their elders.” 

Tr1cky blinks once. Tr1cky blinks twice. Tr1cky approaches the door. 

The ham huffs. 

“Finally, you took your sweet time primping and preening didn’t you?”

Tr1cky opens the door just far enough to squeeze her slightly obese body through, and makes her escape. 

Tr1cky does not look back when the ham begins to screech in protest. Tr1cky knows damn well she’s not pretty enough to be a bimbo, and she doesn’t hold doors for liars. 

AFTERWORD

fatpeoplestories,"Sorry about the formatting, sorry about the length. This isn't even a story really, more of a PSA. So huddle up my little cream cakes, its time for a lecture.

I work in a mortuary. It seems more and more common that the people we see coming through are obese and morbidly obese. This is a problem. Let me tell you about SOME of the post mortem bariatric issues:

-Sheer size. They wont fit on stretchers, on mortuary tables, and in some cases through doors. They need special caskets which are massive. You know how normal coffins are, well, coffin shaped? With the narrow head, wider at the shoulders, then tapers down to the feet end? Well the special obese size caskets have two bends, more like a boat. Also more handles on it, because it takes more people to move. They might need two graves side by side, or else not be able to fit inside any cremator.

-Sheer weight. You know how they say a dead weight feels heavier than a live one? Double for big bodies. Moving even limbs to wash or embalm etc is really hard. We have special hoists to help, but you have to get them in place first, and that on its own is bloody hard work.

-Skin. Skin is the worst problem. Its thin and tears easy, meaning the gallons of smelly edema (water retention) which obese people inevitably carry leaks everywhere. Double if they are starting to decompose. Hard to suture, slippery, often massive ulcers which rot crazy fast. Also amazing how many rolls and folds contain fungus and long forgotten items such as towels, sanitary napkins etc. 

-Faster Purification. You know how seals keep warm in the cold with the layer of fat? Well inside an obese body it stays at that juicy warm living temperature for much longer, and refrigeration is much slower to cool the insides. This gives all the gastric bacteria a perfect environment for longer, and rocket the putrification process. Sores on the skin and ulcers also allow more bacteria, fungus and vermin to infiltrate the body faster. Edema on board can also make this worse. End result is a very smelly, bloaty, messy body in a relatively short amount of time.

-Embalming is fricken hard. If the person is going to be embalmed, the embalmer needs to find arteries and veins to distribute preservative fluid. For you medical folks out there, you can appreciate trying to find even large arteries under inches of yellow, greasey adipose. Even if you find a vessel, theres likely to be shitbox distribution thanks to 'beetus and the massive weight of the tissue crushing itself. Not uncommon to actually need a small team of embalmers. One to work and the rest to hold the flab rolls out of the way.  

-Purge. This is the euphamistic technical term for a dead body leaking fluids from an oriface. The massive crushing force of the body itself and gasses building up from putrification squeeze the internal organs. Since obese people are usually full from stomach to anus (not exaggerating, I have seen the viscera myself) there is a hell of a lot to potentially squeeze out. There is always purge with obese bodies. Sometimes its blood, sometimes its vomit or feces, or something in between, often all the above. Poorly washed vaginal rolls can lead to some pretty oozey infections as well.

-Age. They are never old. They nearly always have young-ish families. Kids whos biggest worry should be acne are burying their mums and dads. Parents are organising a funeral for their kids before they're even old enough to consider their own funerals. 

Tl;dr: Obesity is a problem after death as well as before.

fatpeoplestories,"Hey all, 

Long-time lurker, first time poster, yada yada. I know this story isn't as exciting as some of the others on here, but just thought I'd share. 

A couple of years ago, I was in the city center/commercial district of where I live. Because I have resting nice face, this middle-aged (ish) African-American lady asked me where she could do a certain task; I don't quite remember what it was, but that doesn't really matter for the purposes of the story. 

The important thing was that the best place to do it was in the Barnes &amp; Nobles, which was no further than a block from where we were standing. I suggested this to the woman, and she flipped out like I suggested she give up her first-born. ""Oh I can't possibly walk that far! I'm too old! I have a bad back"" yada yada yada yada cue nonspecific complaining. And I'm like ""But it's just over there"", pointing, within the visible and not-at-all intimidating distance. Seriously, it wasn't even that far. Cue other ham nonsense and comments on my maturity. 

And the thing is, the woman wasn't even that fat. Not visibly obese or anything. And she definitely didn't have any kind of mobility impairment. She was moving around just fine. The whole thing was just weird. 

Maybe it's just because I live in a generally non-obese part of the country, but seriously? You can't walk a block? The bookstore was really very close. And on level ground. In good weather. In the middle of the day. Not much traffic to speak of. 

I don't even get people sometimes.

fatpeoplestories,"So, uh, hi. Long time no see. I'm still an overweight nutcase, just a little lighter now. Went down a pants size, which I'm proud of even though the weight was lost in a non-healthy way (thanks, poverty). I originally wasn't ever planning to write anything about the subject of this story because I thought she was a nice person who just happened to be really fat. I was very wrong.

&gt;So, backstory: 

Georgia has been a PCA working for my grandmother for a long while. We've had a... cordial working relationship (we work for the same company and she brings me paperwork and such needed from the office because I can't drive). Recently, she had one of her dogs sire a litter of puppies. Expensive, purebred (I'm talking 1200+ dollar doggos- the average is 1400$ a puppy) puppies. 

I have some mental health problems (which is no secret- if you ask I will answer, because I actively believe that discussing it will always help lessen the taboo around it) and I wish to self-train (well, mostly, I will have the assistance of a retired dog trainer for a couple things) a psychiatric service dog. I agreed to tutor Georgia's daughter in exchange for a puppy. I've been doing it for a little over four months now, and I was rewarded with getting pick of the litter. [Say hello to Mercy.](https://i.imgur.com/ditj0pp.png)

&gt;And now, the meat of the issue:

In the four months I've spent in Georgia's home (from 5 to 9pm, every Monday to Friday) I've come to learn many things about her, and have several of my suspicions confirmed.

So let's start here: Georgia can't cook for shit. She's probably 5'5 and 400lbs, yet this woman cannot cook a baked potato. Seriously. 

She made some once by slathering an obnoxious amount of butter in tinfoil and wrapping the potatoes up. They weren't even cooked by the time they came out of the oven. She served me a god damn raw potato. That's just the tip of the iceberg of her cooking catastrophes. She makes gravy by combining flour with hamburger grease and attempting to make it into a roux (it just makes a disgusting greasy paste). Ironically, the three people she lives with (her husband, her daughter, and a relative) are all rail thin and that doesn't surprise me after tasting the slop she serves. She doesn't even season her food- no salt, no pepper, no garlic, no nothing! And she willingly eats her own food every night with an egregious amount of salt (and sour cream- she puts sour cream on/in everything. It's disgusting and literally makes me sick because I'm lactose intolerant).

I could go on for days about the garbage she's cooked and I've had to eat because I'm unflinchingly polite no matter what (it's a horrible flaw to have). And it's impossible not to eat because if you don't make a plate within 5 milliseconds of the food being cooked she will make you a plate and bring it over. And watch you eat it.

&gt;I could also put it like this, and I don't say this lightly: her cooking is worse than one-hundred September 11ths. If I had the choice between shooting myself and eating dinner with her I would paint her walls with my brains.

Georgia likes to pretend all she eats is salad (and don't get me wrong I have seen her eat salads before, but it's always followed up with a “sneaky” snack for herself or a fattening beverage) but her figure betrays her. She is, and I don't even like admitting it because I feel mean, one of the fattest people I've met in my life. She waddles and constantly complains of pain (presumably because of her size) and insists that she's a natural health guru (she talks about natural and organic foods almost constantly and everything on her Facebook page is either weird hipster food or feel-good mom posts).

She also seems to consider herself to be some kind of eternal wealth of knowledge- if you have a question she will answer, and more often than not it will be dead wrong. I would, charitably, compare her intelligence to a small rock. She once told me that she thinks pork doesn't have to be perfectly cooked and is acceptable ""rare"". Urgh.

If you were to call my grandmother on the phone and Georgia happened to be her PCA for that day you basically can't even talk normally because Georgia will insert herself in the conversation and constantly babble to my grandmother (and cause her to lose track of what she was talking about/thinking). Georgia loves being the center of attention like that. It's obnoxious.

As I previously mentioned, Georgia brings me paperwork from my employer. She also takes it into the office after I've filled it out. Part of my job is filling out a sheet every week to mark down what I've done for my client, as well as fill out a comment card style paper to record medical appointments, falls/ER trips (if applicable- and you also have to call the office to say that these incidents happened), and general comments on how the client has been doing.

She doesn't only do this for me- she does it for two to four other people... and she reads every single piece of paperwork that she takes in. Which is not only a violation of office policies, but it's also just none of her fucking business. If you have business, she will try to stick her nose in it.

As of late, she's also begun abusing the kindness of others (namely myself and my mother). When I'm at Georgia's house, she doesn't care enough to watch food when it's cooking so I have to (her child and relative are unable to cook, her husband works until late). I've saved her rice from burning and her noodles from overboiling many times without even a thank you in return. And she claims to have a severe smoke allergy (she loves talking about how her migraines are so awful, and yet she's never complained about her husband smoking in the house, or the smoke from the wood stove.... hmm...) so I have to stoke the fire too (her relative doesn't know how, and her child doesn't either). She knows I'm kind to a fault, and seemingly orchestrates it so I always wind up doing these things.

My mother has also unofficially filled in for her at work many times, without pay. Or a thank you.

&gt;Why do we do this? 

Because we're nice. Too nice. Also, my mother only does it for my grandmother's sake. We've tried not doing it but we're just not wired that way. I know we probably seem “beta” or something for that, but oh well. We're just like that- quiet country mice. Yeah, we've gotten fucked over before because of it. Sue us. But I'm digressing.

The last flaw here is that Georgia is some combination of misguided and burnt out at this point. She's spent so long being a PCA that she treats everyone like a client (or... well... more accurately like a child, with her strange condescending intonations and faux-compliments). She also tries to mother everyone- even other adults like myself (she refuses to stop patting my shoulders and ruffling my hair even though I've requested she stop many times). And she lies to get out of work often (making my mother fill in by claiming appointments are scheduled for a family member or somesuch on any given day but her car(s) will be in her driveway all day and nobody will leave her home). She has a rampant sense of entitlement as well- I've seen her (a grown woman, 50+ years old) throw temper tantrums because she couldn't get something her way. 

Oh, and everybody else in her house can only have one snack per day but she has free reign of the whole kitchen 24/7. It's unfair as fuck and grates on my nerves when I remember.

Also, it's petty of me but she wears those long fake french tipped nails and I hate those damn things. They're tacky and gross (on her, anyway).

So, yeah, this has been the ranting hour. Thanks for reading. Love you guys. As soon as Mercy is 8 weeks old I'm going to blast out of the tutoring gig so fast my feet will leave skid marks.","Meet Georgia, who is not sweet like a peach"

fatpeoplestories,"I hate dating but I like sex. I though tinder was the place to go. Plenty of (seemingly) attractive guys, I thought I stood a fair chance at finding an FWB. I ended up chatting with an extremely attractive guy. I shoulda known something was off, he was objectively out of my league and was super into texting and calling me. I should have seen his behavior as desperate and creepy, but I was blinded by his looks. He was a lot of followers on Instagram and Twitter. He randomly stopped posting 6 months ago; I asked him why and he said social media was stressing me out. Fair enough. I had him on Snapchat and even FaceTimed him. Looking back I can see how much of a total dumb ass I was; his face was never super clear in the pics, and even when he FaceTimed I couldn’t see him that well. He said his front camera was having issues, and I believed him.

Finally after a few weeks of talking I met up with him. He told me to come to a park near his place, so I did. I texted him that I was there, and he told me to just come to his house (which was near by) because he wasn’t ready. Full disclosure I was going through I pretty rough time with my depression, and I had gotten unhealthily obsessed with weed. One of the main reasons I wanted to meet up was because I wanted to smoke. 

He opens the door. He’s massive, 6’6” and fat as hell. I didn’t even know what to say, I just looked at him in total shock. He looked NOTHING like his pics. He had the same tattoos as he did on his social media, but his face literally looked nothing like his profile pic. Suddenly everything made sense. The “broken” front camera. The fact that he stopped posting months earlier. I felt like the biggest fucking dumb bitch in the world. On top of everything, my sister borrowed my car so I took an Uber to his place, which was inconvenient.

I stood rooted to his welcome mat, unwilling to go inside. “You don’t look like I thought you would”. He was like “yeah those pics were old. We can just smoke if you want, my sister has friends over we can chill with them.” I thought since there were many people over, I’d be safe, so I went in. It was extremely awkward. He kept trying to put his arm around me and on my thigh, and I realized that I made a mistake. I went into the house of a guy I’d pretty much guaranteed sex to, before I found out what he actually looked like. As he got increasingly touchy, I excused myself to the bathroom and waited inside until the Uber showed up. 

When the Uber pulled up 10 minutes later I got out and found him standing right outside. Alarm bells went off so hard, my heart is actually beating a little faster right now as I type this, remembering this moment. I told him I was leaving and he was like “wait what?” As if we hadn’t established that I’d be leaving soon. I told him the Uber was outside and made my way around him. We were at the top of the stairs. He grabbed my arm and tried to physically drag me into his room, making these weird, scary grunting noises. I froze, and panic set in as a realized I was in physical danger. You know that feeling you get when you tip your chair backwards and you realize you’ve gone too far and you’re gonna fall? My heart was stuck in that sickening lurch. I tried to get away - I’m 5’1 and I weigh 105 pounds. He had more than a foot and like 200 pounds on me. I told him I was gonna call the cops and he ripped my purse off of my shoulder and emptied it on the ground. I was high and panicked as fuck at this point; I didn’t even give a shit about my purse I just wanted to get out. I ran downstairs right as I heard his mom (who I hadn’t realized was home) call to him, wondering what the noise was. 

I ran down the stairs and got to the door but for some reason I couldn’t unlock it. I kept telling his mom I wanted to leave but she wouldn’t open the door and was asking me questions. Finally the fucking ogre lumbered down the stairs and gave me my purse back, telling his mom he thought I stole something (what the fuck would I steal from his bathroom?) I told her my Uber was outside and asked her to walk me out. My Uber was about to fucking leave when I got there, racing in and slamming the door. I still get hot flashes thinking about it - nothing really even happened to me but I can’t get it out of my head, typing this out made me nauseous. 

__TL;DR__ my long ass story of my dumb ass getting catfished by a fat dude. Life sucks.

A little backstory:

I work in a store. I'm 6ft 210lbs and I love lifting. Been doing it for years. My proudest achievement in lifting is my 350lbs bench press. I'm probably 20% body fat if not a little more.

This fat guy on an electric wheelchair was just on his way out of the store. Before he left he stopped and told me ""Don't work yourself to death. Cardio is fatal - or so I've heard"" and just laughed and continued on his merry way.

He didn't have any screws tightened according to my colleagues who spoke to him prior to this. But I found it pretty funny, given that he was joking. I'm not sure that he was but w/e.

fatpeoplestories,"I got seated next to an obese person on a ~10h long flight. 

I knew it was bad news when I saw that his thighs had spilled into my seat from under the armrest before I even sat down. Normally, since I’m a relatively petite Asian woman (5’2, 110-120lbs depending on how much I’ve been snacking), I don’t mind people spilling into my seat. My husband has really broad shoulders so he always spills into my seat and I still have plenty of room. 

The guy was polite enough....until he fell asleep. He started spreading. He just kept opening his legs wider &amp; wider until he pushed the armrest up and spilled into my seat. I tried shoving him back but I guess I need to work out more, because he wouldn’t budge. I tried pushing the armrest down but that made the fat spread out more. Clearly, this isn’t s case of big bones. 

And looking at his nonstop flow of sugary drinks and refusal to drink anything that’s not a soft drink (not the diet version either), this is clearly not a case of genetics. 

Through all this shoving, he stayed asleep. 

On the positive side, I got a free workout on the plane, so I got that going on me. 

I fell asleep with my legs crossed and spilling into my husband’s seat, because that was the only way I could fit in my seat now. 

The guy was nice enough when he woke up and it was a full flight, so I didn’t make a big deal out of it, but damn...my hips and back ache, and I can’t help but feel pissed. 

I wish airlines would just get passengers to sit on a test seat to see if they’ll fit in a single seat, and make people purchase 2 tickets if they can’t fit. Or discount the seats of those sitting next to obese passengers.

fatpeoplestories,"Well, the roommates I live with, we only moved in together the 1st of this month.  I know one of them but it's another friend of ours that owns the house, and it's a fairly big house, with a mother in law cottage in the back and 6 good sized bedrooms inside.  The fat bitch I speak of?  She lives in the mother in law cottage by herself and has seemed to pretty much keep to herself so I ASSUMED she was a decent person.  

Thing is ALL of us living here are doing so because the person who owns the house is letting us get back on our feet, rent is pretty cheap, and they expect us to repay that in the future by paying it forward.  What this means is that past tenants of this amazing mutual friend sometimes come by with gifts of food, extra clothing donations and gift cards to say walmart etc, to help us out the way this friend helped them out.

It's a pretty cool set up and I'm really lucky to know this friend.

Anyway as I hear it, this fat bitch....who is 5ft and around 300lbs, had asked to get the mother in law cottage to herself.  The thing is that it has 2 small bedrooms in it, but she wants to take up room from someone else having a place to live so that she can fill the second bedroom with ""extra food storage in case her shugahs get low....yanno?""  And I guess she managed to get the landlord/friend to do this by giving a sob story about bullying and anxiety and needing her privacy.....but whatever we barely see her....which is good because she also smells pretty bad whenever we have briefly crossed paths in common areas there is this moldy cheese scent in the air.

So anyway....

So yesterday was St Patrick's day, right?    Someone had brought by these huge cookie cakes from a local bakery, like 5 of them, they have massive frosted shamrocks in the middle and are decorated up really pretty.  Now there's about 15 people been milling about the house over the weekend kinda partying etc, but only one of those cakes got touched, and even then was maybe half gone last night, and the massive shamrock in the middle, was not touched because everyone had found the frosting way too sweet combined with the chocolate chip cookie base itself.

When we woke up this morning guys.....every single cookie cake had been opened and all the shamrock bits had been cut out and were eaten.  We didn't care too much, was way too sweet but still, one of the roommate said they saw her cutting them out one by one but at the time was too stoned to want to get off the couch to confront her about it.....fair enough really recreational cannabis is legal here so i don't care....lol

But she ate basically 5 insides of a cookie cake topped with 2 inches of thick butter cream frosting....

I'm so glad we don't share a bathroom with that girl because eww what are her shits like?  Though someone also over heard her saying that she ate sugar free gummy bears and never got the shits like most people say she should have and was bragging about them trying to make her sick and failing at it.

fatpeoplestories,"I was drinking one night with two friends, we'll call them Tom and Jon. 

Tom is single and worked at a clothing department which employed many attractive young women who were attending the local college. The best perk of his job. Tom is around 5'10"" and 160lbs. He's also kind of a dick.

Jon is also single, and an alcoholic. But fun to be around so long as he doesn't go off the deep end. Jon is 6' or so and a ripped 185 lbs.

I'm not single and happily with my girlfriend for many years. I'm 5'9"" and around 160 lbs.

Tom has been talking to one girl in particular from the store and invites her over from some drinks. She plans on bringing two friends. Cool, we'll have some drinks and a good time. I'm not looking to hook up but I know Tom and Jon are, so I'll do my best to make it happen.

The girls arrive. We'll call them, Tina, Jen, and Desperate Ham (DH). Tina is very attractive, and the girl who Tom has been talking to. Jen is also pretty, similar to Tina. DH is, well... a Ham. She's around 5'3"" and easily 250lbs, maybe more. She's wearing a white shit that is four sizes too small and looks like a marshmallow. I could already see where this was going, and maybe you can too...

We're all playing some drinking games, listening to music, and having a decent time. I look over and see Jen and Jon making out. That didn't take long. A few minutes later, they stumble into his room and leave us four in the living room. This is when the conversations split. Tom and Tina start cuddling on a chair and flirting, which leaves DH and I to chat on the couch.

We're making small talk, and out of no where DH says ""let me tell you a secret,"" while beckoning me with her finger. As I move closer to her, she goes in for a kiss. Her breath. Her chins. Oh my God. 

I pull my head back and say ""woah, woah,"" in shock. She totally doesn't get the hint and says ""Oh you must be shy. That's cute."" She then grabs me and tries to forcefully kiss me again. This time I backup a full cushion away, and freeze. 

What do I do? I look over and see Tom and and Tina holding hands and exiting the room to Tom's bedroom. All of my logic is screaming, ""RUN!"" but I don't want to ruin the night for my friends. After talking with DH for a while, she has a ""if I can't get what I want, no one can get what they want"" attitude. If I tell her her breath smells of cheetos and ass, she will likely become a drama bomb and ruin the night for my other friends. So I do what any good friend would do; sigh and wing up.

I say, ""Okay, sorry, yeah I'm a bit shy. Let's not move so fast."" She winks and says ""Okay."" She then starts telling me about her weight loss and showing me pictures of when she was even larger. She had gastric bypass and lost 100 lbs in the past year. I congratulate her and tell her to keep it up. She has obviously gained a lot of confidence but I don't think she understands how heavy she still is. 

We talk more and after about 5 minutes she grabs my hand and drags me into the other bedroom. Gulp.

I sit on the bed and start making small talk about something in the room when I'm interrupted by a sharp pain that feels as if both my legs were ripped off. She somehow managed to defy physics by leaping onto my lap and is now straddling me. My body screams HELP. She is holding a condom wrapper in her **TEETH** and says bluntly, ""Can I put this on you?""

Okay. Game over. I don't care anymore if she ruins the night. I'm done, man. I finally break it to her, ""Look, I'm sorry but I have a girl friend. This is definitely not happening tonight.""

She proceeds to beg. Literally beg. She tries to put on her best pouty face and says:

""Please let me. Please fuck me. I would never tell anyone I swear. **Please let me be your mistake.**""

She begged me to let her be my mistake. I shudder now just thinking of her saying that. It is burned into my memory forever. 

After many ""nos"" and ""NOS"" I finally force her off me. Reality sets in and she sighs and says, ""Fine.... Can I at least give you a blowjob?""

And now you can see why I dubbed her Desperate Ham. I declined the Ham Job.

At this point, it had been around 30 minutes since Tom and Tina went into his room so I figured that was enough time. I retreated to the couch and pretended to pass out while texting another friend and ranting to him about what just happened. He had some laughs. I shed some tears.

After the girls left, I went completely mad at Tom and explained to him what I had to go through. We had some laughs, but Tom didn't even thank me. Remember, Tom is a dick. After things escalated a bit, I ended up punching Tom in the face. But in the end he took it and said he deserved it. But he still didn't thank me.

TL;DR: Tom invites girls over. I end up getting stuck with 250lb ham. Have to pretend to be interested to not ruin my friend's night. She begs me to fuck her and to let her be my mistake. Then begs to give me a blowjob. Tom didn't even thank me. I punched Tom. Tom is a dick.","Being a Wingman Almost Got me Crushed by ""Desperate Ham"""

fatpeoplestories,"This just happened and I'm so astounded, I have to write about it immediately. So today, I went to Disneyland with my husband and my close friend from college, Kristin (not her real name). 

While waiting for our next Fastpass to kick in, we decided to take a break at this restaurant called The Golden Horseshoe, a Western saloon style of place. A show was starting in 5-10 min when we got there, so the timing was perfect.

The three of us were comfortably seated and chatting when this large woman loomed into view and interrupted us, asking, ""Is this seat free?""

We told her it was and she could take it.

""Could you move?"" she demanded, ""So I don't need to grab that seat and drag it all the way here?""

She and her equally large friend picked the table *right next to us.* 

Kristin, ever so polite, instinctively moved from her seat that was next to their table to our extra seat, which was facing the back instead of the stage, so she had to turn the seat around. 

That woman looked annoyed, pointedly looked at me, and in a sarcastically sweet voice, she went, ""I meant you. Can you get up and move so I don't need to move the seat?""

Seriously? The seat Kristin so generously just left was literally less than a foot away from her friend and moving that was too much effort for her? She wanted me to get out of my seat and sit separately from my husband just because she was too lazy to move a chair less than a foot away?

Oh and even better, turned out they weren't asking for our extra chair because they had too many people in their party. There were just the two of them. There were 4 seats in their table, but they rather ask strangers to evacuate their seats rather than moving their own seats to their desired positions. 

I gave her what I hoped was a cold stare and stayed in my seat. 

""Ugh, never mind,"" she snapped, ""I guess I'll *have* to move this *chair*."" And made a huge show of pulling a chair over a distance of less than a foot and acting like I just shat in my seat and told her to clean it up. 


How are people this lazy??



",Let me force people out of their seats because I'm too lazy
fatpeoplestories,"Hi all,

Throwaway because this story is so incomprihensbly gross that I don't want to touch it with a ten-foot pole. Anyway, be me. RT, female, 5-4 and 165 pounds. I know, I know, a bit on the heavy side. Don't be HamParent, female, 5-6 ish, probably around 190? Heavy, but not massive. For the love of god, do not ever be HamChild. 13ish, Female, easily 250+. Probably 5-2, short arms(realize later on). Now, i sit down in my aisle seat, see no one next to me, and am briefly happy. Then I hear that it is a full flight. Near the end of the boarding process, HamChild waddles aboard. Proceeds to sit next to me, forcing me to get up, with HamParent in the window. As soon as they sit down, HamChild grabs a pack of some high-sugar snack from her bag, and starts munching away. She has pushed the armrest up as she sat down, however, and is protruding into my seat. I say something along the lines of ""hi, I know the seats are really tight, but would you mind putting the armrest down?"" This is a ten hour flight, so I want my seat. She attempts to put it down, realizes she can't, and apologizes. However, the mom takes the opportunity to try to spend the next hour converting me to a crusader against size discrimination by airlines. I tune most of this out, and by now, HamChild is watching some TV show. At one point, I briefly here a sound almost like a leak a water bottle- a very faint trickling, but I ignore it as one of the airplane sounds. Several times I also here crinkling, but the person behind me has a plastic water bottle, so I ignore it. About 3 hours into the flight, it starts to smell absolutely terrible in my area of the plane-a large fart, x100. I hope it will soon pass. Now, once the seatbelt sign goes off, HamChild tries to get out to stand up. I let her through, assuming she is going to the bathroom, but she instead just wanders around for a minute. However, as she is backing her massive rump back into here seat, I notice that her pants have slipped down.m a small bit. Guess what she is wearing under them. An adult diaper. I initially feel sympathetic to some extent( I have had family experiences with incontitince) however, when I quickly mention the smell to HamParent, she decides to go into another tirade on the size of airplane bathrooms, and explains that HamChild, a perfectly healthy little girl, cannot fit into them, as they are designed for ""skinny rabbits."" This just left me absolutely stunned. For her part, HamChild was clearly very accustomed to wearing diapers. I find out why later in the moms tirade-they design public restrooms so that robust people cannot wipe, apparently, as part of nationwide discrimination. Late on in the flight, HamChilds diaper becomes obvious to all as she uses it enough for her pants to get wet. I was so dumbfounded by this that I didn't even think to reply.

AlmondPapa also thought that I was a weedy little shit who needed to get some tough before she apologized herself into some dark shit. So, he pulled me aside, sat me down and told me I was a wimp. He then started to train me into becoming a little less beta. The thing that was causing me to be like this, was my fear of being perceived as impolite and rude, so I let people walk all over me so I could be seen as ‘nice’. AlmondPapa, through his many training routines such as throwing oranges at me if I apologized too often, and telling me when I had polite but firm confrontation that I was doing well, helped me to realize that this consistent personal problem was dumb.

That year, I went to my first gay pride and good god I loved it. Everywhere you looked there were people like me, just being happy and themselves, and there were people in amazing make up, and someone was dressed as the devil- it was great. 

During the actual parade, as many of you will know there’s a section where people carry a large flag. I was stood in front of a hot girl with a buzz cut- carrying a sign that said ‘Peace and love and kissing girls.’ I was crushing  b a d. I introduced myself with a shaky, ‘Hey I love your sign.’ And she told me her name was GalaxyGirl. She told me I was cute and I was fucking losing it inside, but keeping it cool on the outside by telling her I thought she was hot. We got to talking through the entirety of the parade and before RainBoi dragged me to jam to Madonna with some drag queens, I gave her my number and told her, get ready, that ‘I’d love to be the girl she kissed sometime.’ 30 minutes later I get a text from her, we meet up and next thing you know we’re making out in a field while Eartha Kitt blares in the background. Not even kidding. And that is the story of how I met my girlfriend. 

Post make out, we took a selfie. An important note to make out (GIVE ME UPVOTES IM MAKING PUNS) was that I was wearing an orangey red lipgloss. Which was now all over GalaxyGirl’s face. It was clear what we’d been doing. And when we’d finally taken one we liked, I posted it to Instagram, with just a sparkle emoji as a caption because my brain doesn’t work when someone’s tongue has been in my face. 

I enjoyed the fuck out of the pride.

fatpeoplestories,"This is a short 2 for 1 value deal (pun intended)
My MIL is who about 5’1 and has to be pushing close to 3 bills is a very frugal person. My DH and I used to live on MIL’s property for a few months when we were broke, she had many animals who were quite neglected. 
I had got some Mickey D’s on the way back “home”. I was outside on the patio eating my chicken wrap when I noticed I ate all the chicken in it and all that was left was tortilla and veggies so I decided to give it to one of the many dogs who lived there. 
I let the dog have a bite from my hand, as MIL walks out of the house and says “No! Don’t waste it on the dog, I’ll eat it!” Now I swear she saw this dog just take a bite of this wrap, but fuck it I handed it to her anyways and she ate the chicken less, slobbery tortilla with tomatoes. I haven’t been able to order a chicken wrap since.

I wasn’t there for this second story, but i have to hear it every time DH’s mother gets brought it. 
Long story short- DH had a bag of Mickey D’s on the floor of his truck, she saw said bag and asked if she could have the rest. He told her it had been sitting there for at least a week, she ate the left over fries anyway. 

Bonus- this woman (at the time) had exactly ONE tooth. Just one. ",NEVER let food go to waste
fatpeoplestories,"This is not a typical fat person story. The main character didn't do anything outrageous or disgusting, and it's not an exciting story. But he still completely missed reality because of his weight, and it just made me sad.  

This was a few years ago. I lived in Silicon Valley, and I made the mistake of downloading tinder out there. Jesus. It's an aggressive sausagefest of guys whose idea of flirting is just convincing me that their current company is the ""next big thing."" After a handful of painfully stereotypical techie dates, I deleted tinder, but I stayed in touch with one guy, who we'll call John.  

I'm not sure why I initially swiped right on John. Physically, he's not my type: he was quite fat (maybe not obese though), and just not very physically attractive. But he was good at conversation, a developer like me, and most importantly, absolutely hilarious. It takes a LOT to make me laugh out loud over text, and he could crack me up anytime. If tech didn't work out, I swear he could go into comedy. I had never clicked with someone so hard via just text alone. I could really see myself with him. So, weeks after first contact, we went on a date.  

I had vowed to give up on dating, and I hadn't been on a date in weeks, so this was kind of a big deal for me. I went all out. I even smelled like a goddamn flower, all because I actually liked this guy. And after weeks of talking, I felt like I genuinely knew him.  

We grabbed a drink after work one night. When I walked in, the first thing he said to me was:  
""So, did you just come from another date, or what?"" he asked accusingly.  
""Wh-What? No!"" I was caught off guard by this. What part of me gave him that vibe? Did I commit some faux-pas?  
""Oh, then what's with the dress?""  
""Oh, uh, I just felt like it."" Confidence-wise, I went straight from I'm-a-babe-and-I'm-gonna-rock-this to Oh-god-I-must-look-like-a-desperate-clown.  

A few minutes later, I apparently exposed a shoulder. I have a lot scarring across my entire shoulder from an insane sports accident. I kind of like the scars. They're like tiger stripes, and it's kind of a good conversation starter.  
Upon seeing my scars, John's eyes grew wide.  
""I can't believe you'd come to a date with a hickey from another guy.""  
My scars really do not look like hickeys. They're raised and knotted and white/pink (I apologize if that's graphic). The point is, definitely not a bruise.  

For the rest of the night, perhaps to establish his alpha-ness, all of the stories he told about himself were about his exploits dating ""honeys"" when he was an undergraduate (which was years ago). He had a cool job and hobbies and friends and so much more to talk about. But he chose to focus on his ""honeys.""  
This was so different from the John I'd spent weeks talking to. I had been personality catfished.  

I left after about an hour of this, and I texted him after that I just didn't think we clicked in person (too chicken to say it face-to-face).  

His response?  
""Typical. I knew when you walked in that you looked too shallow to date a fat guy.""  
[Edited to add: I did tell him exactly why I turned him down, hoping that he learns from it!]

Maybe he thought that, because of his weight, he'd have to ""neg"" me down to his level in order for me to like him. I tried to explain my side, but where he is today, he is probably still being kind of an asshole to people and blaming their reactions on his weight.","Tried to date a cool fat person. He was uncool, so it didn't work. And then he blamed it on being fat."

Me and my friends, a,b, and dickhead, had gone to a swimming pool and cause I was feeling pretty body positive I wore a 1950’s Marylin Monroe style swimsuit with those flaps that you tie around the back of your neck. It was really cute and I felt really pretty, I have warm toned skin and the Black was making me feel like a milky gay Beyoncé, because bitch I was feeling myself. I felt so good that I got a stranger to take a photo of all of us in our swimsuits. We thought it was great and I posted in on Instagram. 

&gt;Let’s play a game!
&gt;Was this A) A good choice.
&gt;B) A bad choice.
&gt; Or C) You might as well delete your account SoyMilk, you dumb motherfucker. 

&gt;If your answer was C, Congratulations!


There have been many bad decisions in the world. Cheese in a can, the invention of those sticks you wipe your butt with, the creation of Naruto. We as a civilization though, can never truly match how much of a shitty thing it was to post a scantily clad photo of me in a provocative setting. 

The photo was EXTREMELY positively received with a lot of my friends telling me how good I looked, in particular RainBoi who is the most flamboyant gay in the history of camp. His many comments consisted of things like this: ‘YASSSS BITCH FUCK ME UP YOU BETTER WORK YOUR SHIT BRING IT TO THE RUNWAY SLAY ME FOR DAYYYYSS.’ You get the picture. The thing that worried me though was that Hamley hadn’t commented on the picture or liked  the picture and the majority of times I had uploaded she had been the first person to like and comment a heart or some shit. 

I leave my phone for a few minutes and then I am suddenly onslaughted by the quickest and most continuous series of vibrations I have ever heard. I checked the phone and, of course, it was Harley.

So I reply with an obvious, ‘Why?’

Soy:‘Yes, but there’s nothing wrong with me taking photos in that style.’
HQ:‘SoyMilk, no. You can’t just appropriate culture like that. Curvy girls like me feel shamed when you post stuff like that.’
Soy:‘But I felt pretty.’

This is going to make some people very happy.

‘Only whores and sluts post pictures of their bodies like that.’
‘And who the hell is ‘RainBoi’ I thought you were gay you fucking slut’
‘Only curvy girls can pull this shit off, and you’re cute but you’re not sexy like me.’
‘Delete the fucking image.’
‘I’m the only one who can see you like that,slut.’

Before I go into what I did, I want to reinforce how hypocritical this bitch was. Apparently only curvy girls could pose like that. But if you pose like that you’re a slut. So... curvy girls are sluts?
But anyway:
At this point I’m crying and really upset. The idea of being a slut, raised in a catholic household, was really terrifying to me because the Bible is always saying stuff about fidelity and it really gets hammered into you. (Now I’m a shitlady and I couldn’t care less tho- respect if you are Christian but ain’t nothing wrong with getting a lil bit spicy sometimes.)

So I do the only thing I know how.

I deleted the image. 

I’m really sad I did that. But Hamley was appeased by it:

fatpeoplestories,"fresh lurker here and thought this would be a good place to post this story. Sorry for my formatting, I'm still pretty new to posting

So there is this really great Indian restaurant across the street from a popular food hall in my hometown.  I love coming here because their lunch special is ridiculous and fills me for the whole day. You get served fast because their curries on the special is in a heating table. I was enjoy enjoying my meal when she came in.

I'm gonna preface this by saying that I am Mexican, and so is the person this story is about, let's call her Freham Carlo (FC for short). I've been coming here for years. Its a family run place and the owners are really nice. Now for people new to Indian food, there are a lot of spices and there is a lot of sauce(curry) for the mainstream stuff, so it might deter some. The owners seem to have experience with this as they usually try to explain their dishes to people and are very upfront about their food. In walks walks FC

Now I'm overweight myself (5'5, ~165 at the time), but this perfect specimen of curves and personality easily doubles me and towers under me. She walks up to the register and this pleasant exchange happens.

FC: (in her winded and nasally voice) I want to order food
Owner: Okay, if you would like the lunch special feel free to pick out what you would like and well start working on the rest.
FC: That does't look good, I want something else 
Owner: Well you can pick anything off of our menu and we could work on that for you.
FC: I don't want anything with sauce what do you have without sauce.
(owner lists everything on the menu that is not curry)
at this point FC asks about tandoori chicken, luckily someone in the restaurant ordered it and she got a look at it.
FC: No, I don't want that, it looks weird...let me just get the(shrimp curry dish they have that I forgot the name of) but just the shrimp
Owner: just the shrimp?
FC: yeah, I just want the shrimp
Owner: but its made with curry and some vegetables, it won't be good if it' just shrimp
FC: Well I just want the shrimp

Now one of the main rules of foodservice is that the customer is (almost) always right. so the owner rings her up, full price, for her meal, which is literally just shrimp; she didn't order rice or naan, she just got shrimp. FC gets her meal, doesn't check it and is on her merry way. Maybe 5 minutes later she comes back to complain.

FC: This is a little shrimp, and it smells weird! I am not paying 12 bucks for this!
Owner: That is what you ordered. I told you It wouldn't be good without the other stuff
FC: I don't care, I want to return it!

The owners being the good people they are, and honestly seeing this coming a mile away, gave her a refund and took her food. I gave the owner a look of ""is thick trick for real?"" and they just shook their heads in agreement.

Not very eventful, but thought it was worth a share

fatpeoplestories,"**Edit: I was more drunk than not when writing this the first time, so I have edited for clarity. Lady Gaga was removed. V sorry.**

Long time no see! Terribly sorry, I got a new video game and have been wasting my youth playing it. Whatever, I’m 25, basically an old hag. To paraphrase Sansa Stark in the first GOT novel, “But Beric Dondarrion was *terribly* old, he was twenty two.” Thanks Fancy Sansy, you rock. 

But! I’m back with a story to send your blood sugar reaching for the stars. 

Before we start - a disclaimer: I in no way harbor any sort of resentment or stigma towards the mentally ill, and do not encourage others to do so. I have some disorders of my own, and so I joke about them, perhaps in poor taste, as I joke about being gay. Call my cats gay, my computer gay, my mom gay, etc. To summarize: you’re gay. 

Let’s begin. 

Your garden-variety Hams are a dime a dozen; today, we wade through the tall grass to find a more rare evolution. What’s better than a typical Ham, you ask? Why, it’s a Ham that’s fresh off the assembly line at the Nuckin Futs Factory in Batshit, KY. 

Be me: your buddy, your pal, your good ol jaded EMT. Irritated about most everything. Only want to go home and play with my cats, but have to work to afford more cats. 

Observe and probably don’t want to be: Dave, former player in the game of Ham. Dave is fun and a nice gentleman with a retainer that he apologized for every time he took it out to eat. 18 year old freshly minted EMT. 

Don’t be: Sonny the Cukoo Bird-Ham. Small-to-Mid Planet Sized Ham nuttier than a squirrel’s secret stash. 

Setting: yet again, another humid and scalding summer day. Perhaps I wouldn’t have hated the job so much if I wasn’t working in constant hellfire, but I don’t really care to test my theory. 

Dave and I have had a merry day, and by merry I mean things proceeded without incident. There was no merriment, the EMS gods consider that blasphemous. How dare you smile, heathen?

We get a run to transport an ER pink slip to a mental hospital. A pink slip, in the medical world, is the paperwork used to detain a mentally unstable individual and take them to the hospital. In Fast and Furious, it’s what Paul Walker (RIP my dude) lost to Vin Diesel in the wee beginnings of the franchise. Most pink slips are taken to the closest ER, whether or not that hospital has a specific ward for mentally - and potentially dangerous- ill. If there isn’t one, that’s when they call OP and Dave, so we can transport them from an ER to a hospital that does have that ward. Pass the buck, fellas. 

And so it goes. 

Dave and I go into the ER, it’s a smaller one, only about 10 beds arranged in an L-shape. We’re directed to our patient, and are totally (read: not at all) delighted to see that he is juuuuust small enough not to need a bariatric bed, but juuuuust big enough to be a pain in the ass, like a hemorrhoid from hell that makes the otherwise pleasurable act of shitting a visit with Satan himself.

In my first story, I believe, I said that 300 pounds was the weight limit for bariatric. I have to correct myself, as I have been informed it’s 350. The more the merrier!

He’s pushing 320, but is strangely shaped.  He’s average height, around 5’9”, and he looks, dare I say it, not Hammy? That’s when I discover the excellent deception properties of hospital gowns, for he was not what he seemed. 

Like a 10 pound sausage crammed into a wrapping made for 5 pounds, chub is squeezing out everywhere within his gown and touching it makes me feel like I need to bathe in holy water for at least the next decade. But I can’t not touch it, because I need to get this big ol betch onto the stretcher, into the rig, and the mother f-word out of my life. 

Now I know I said that he was crazy, yeah? He actually behaved for the most part until we got him into the rig. He was rustling through his bag of belongings and told us that his wallet wasn’t there. Oh well shit, I ran back in to ask the ER staff if they still had it. They didn’t, but did a quick strip of the room to see if they somehow missed it. No dice, so I head back outside. 

I exit the sliding doors to see crazy Ham surrounded by 8 police officers who have their hands on their guns, ready to pull them from their belts

Lol. Dave. My poor, sweet, Dave. He is desperately scream-whispering to a nurse if we can sedate Crazy Ham. Answer is, shocker: no. I grab him and ask what in the hell happened. 

Apparently, I was gone too long. In the FIVE MINUTES that I looked for his wallet - I mean of course I spent time looking for it it’s something that carries one’s identifying info, money, etc. - he decided I was the devil and that I had called the police on him, so he booty bounced baby Dave (lol B3D) away from him, unhooked the stretcher straps, and tried to take off. 

The hospital system we were contracted with was big enough to have their own police department, and at least 12 patrol cars at each hospital location at any given time. That’s literally their “neighborhood”. They’d mostly park outside the ER, since that was the area that most often required law enforcement intervention. 

But, obviously, I had “called the X hospital PD and implored them to come to X hospital’s ER because I knew what conspiracy Crazy Ham was going to expose, and I wanted to stop him so the filthy Americans wouldn’t know.” 

Now, I’m not saying there aren’t legitimate conspiracies abound, but I’m pretty sure Crazy Ham’s theory that they were implanting tracking devices into toothbrushes wasn’t all that legit. I mean, yes, most Americans brush their teeth, we aren’t medieval heathens, but, really? I know the toothpaste tube says not to swallow it, but I always do swallow a bit since I’m brushing my teeth before the god damn sun comes up and my cats want their morning dose of crack/wet food, so they’re milling about, meow-yell-screaming at me, tripping me, and doing all the other things that no one wants to deal with before the sun comes up. 

Tl;dr: toothbrushes aren’t the most reliable tracking devices. 

Dave and I go back to Crazy Ham and convince him that we’re not government plants, we just want to get him safely to a place where he can be helped. Abruptly, Crazy Ham says “ok!” and hops back into the rig. 

Surprise, surprise, he looks again and finds his wallet in his bag of belongings. 

Poor Dave was (again) in the back with him. According to Dave, Crazy Ham detailed how al-qeada was infiltrating the US via our toothbrushes and smartphones. Smartphones, I can believe. Again, toothbrushes are not as convincing. 

We arrive at the larger hospital with a ward equipped to handle Crazy Ham. Except...he’s not having it. Shocker. 

He doesn’t want to go. BUT, he’ll go if he can have a cigarette first. He asks us to drive him to the nearest convenience store. Obviously, fucking no, but I was feeling philanthropic, so I gave him one of mine, which was ILLEGAL AS FUCK BUT SERIOUSLY I WANTED LUNCH AND THIS WAS TAKING 76 YEARS, and said I would give him the whole pack if he behaved. 

Ladies and gentlemen, Crazy Ham turned into a sweet little lamb. Honestly, I think the gesture of kindness kinda punted him back into - however brief - lucidity, and he spent the next few minutes telling us how sorry he was for all the trouble, how he heard voices that told him to say the things he did, and how he wished he could get better. 

I filed that away into my “tell the admitting nurse stat” folder, he finished his cig and meekly went along into the dungeons of the psych ward without a peep. 

I said I wanted to eat, right? So did Dave. WRONG. I spent the next hour going over the literal 30 second conversation I had with Crazy Ham. However, even though I was starving, emaciated, I could already see my limbs wasting away - I’m really glad I did. Apparently, in his various visits to the psych ward (of which there were - unsurprisingly - a decent number of) Crazy Ham hadn’t previously shown signs of schizophrenia, and his candid conversation with me gave the treating physicians a HUGE head start in getting him the help he needs. 

Yeah, I’m a hero, bow before me, shower me with love and affection. Actually, don’t. I don’t like people touching me.

Whatever, I shook off my laurels and ate a chipotle burrito, comped Dave’s meal, and we rode off into the sunset on our valiant steeds, I mean...in our 300K+ miles rig...to pick up another Ham, which will be told in my next installment, in which I will be less drank and more frank.

fatpeoplestories,"Warning, this story is not super gross or interesting, I just wanted to see if it's relatable*:

I was chatting with my girlfriends Cake and Taco and I said ""You know what, there should be a website full of photos normal genital blemishes so people worry less when they get a zit or ingrown hair down there.""

This led to Cake asking if it'd be weird if she sent us a picture of her crotch. Taco is a nurse and I'm not judgmental so we said ""Sure, is something wrong?""

So she sends the photo and she has dark abscesses on her inner thighs. Before we get to our reactions, here's some background:

We've all known each other since we were 5 years old.

I grew up very fat, always around 100lbs over weight or more since 4th grade. When I became an adult I took control of my weight. I'm still overweight but 1000x better than where I was.

Taco has never had a weight problem. She goes up and down occasionally but is what you'd call average.

Cake grew up average and became thin in her late teens. Over the last few years her weight has grown and grown and now she is obese and goes back and forth between disbelief and denial.

So we see the photo and my first response is ""How's your weight doing? I used to have something like that when I was bigger.""

Taco's responses included ""Maybe you're walking too much. Try a different laundry detergent. Don't have sex for a week.""

Good for Cake that she immediately agreed with me and mentioned that she had a feeling it was weight related when the pamphlet the doctor gave her was full of fat people.

That said, the rest of our conversation was almost totally unrelated to weight. Taco wouldn't say anything about it and Cake tried to avoid it so I took the hint and dropped it.

So I guess my question is, why is this so taboo? And who is it taboo to? Taco, who again is a nurse, was either afraid to say anything or truly didn't think weight was the root of the issue. I get Cake not wanting to talk about it because I feel that shame myself but come on, we know that's what the real issue is here. And while I said something about it I felt I couldn't truly be honest in fear of offending everyone.

I'm not sure if I have a point, just venting and hoping someone can relate.

*No one has asked yet but just in case you're curious, Cake told us the doctor told her she had [hidradenitis suppurativa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidradenitis_suppurativa).

fatpeoplestories,"My family is dealing with a major health crisis that recently entailed myself and the patient spending a lot of time the last forty days or so, in a major regional healthplex.

And my first reaction to what I saw in that place, mainly the cancer/endocrinology section, was, ""Oh my GOD, is this Wally World?"" This is because I literally couldn't turn around without bumping into the morbidly obese. 

You'd see entire families, kids and all, clustered around someone in a wheelchair, tubes and wires in all directions, and the whole crew easily massed collectively as much as a two ton dump truck, empty.

Lines of morbidly obese waiting for radiation therapy.

Lines of morbidly obese taking turns at the elevators.

All the wheelchairs were doublewides.

The cafeteria was a bit chi chi, nice hand-made pizzas with good toppings, spelt and lentil salads, whole grain breads made right in front of you; all surprisingly reasonably priced. All items including the drinks fountains had their calorie counts plainly posted next to them and suggested meals with calorie and nutritional counts were plainly posted beside them. The medical staff and the thinner people were eating there, while the outer waiting areas were full of an amazing number of the morbidly obese eating McDonald's and drinking large fountain drinks brought in.

More than once I literally walked out of the cancer and endocrinology/diabetes sections and into the front drop-off or side parking garage areas and saw ROWS of generic morbidly obese and frequently low income individuals who were also in one or more stages of obesity, smoking in their wheelchairs.

And the response to my SO and his rare cancer (not lifestyle related or hereditary) by the medical staff was interesting: he was one of their few patients who wasn't morbidly obese, a smoker, a drinker, or a professional couch potato. 

The last sight I saw that day for me was a young man sitting across from me as I waited for our car, who literally TOOK UP AN ENTIRE BENCH his ASS WAS SO BIG waiting for the valet parking service to bring his vehicle to him.

His car came, some sort of SUV.  He heaved himself to his feet with his cane and panting, made his elephantine way sideways through the double-wide automatic sliding doors. The valet got out of the vehicle and helped him in. The kicker? Someone had taken the front seats out of the vehicle, which was already huge, and HE SAT IN THE BACK SEAT AND DROVE AWAY - SUCKING down a HUGE STARBUCKS.

Judas Priest! He had a BEAUTIFUL (not prissy) face, that sat on top of that huge, billowing burden of a body - a face topped by nice, thick, silky-looking black hair, that would have got him at least LOOKED AT in Hollywood - and he coudldn't have been out of his early twenties.

WHAT KIND OF MOTHER WOULD LET HER SON GO SO FAR DOWN THE TOILET WHERE HE WAS SO FAT HE HAD TO SIT IN THE BACK SEAT TO DRIVE HIS CAR???

PROBABLY THE ONE WHO FILLED HIS PLATE EVEN AS SHE OVERFLOWED HER OWN KITCHEN CHAIR.

I'd like to think that his family were sad at his size, that they begged him to do something, to stop eating so much, to take better care of himself. 

But no.

This, this is the new normal.

Cancer is fed by sugar. Diabetes is antagonized/made worse by sugar. Blindness, obesity, arthritis, you name it - sugar, obesity - Feeling like I'd just experienced an H.R. Geiger retrospective show, I walked out of that medical complex feeling like I was leaving a legal suicide facility.

fatpeoplestories,"Hello hello! It's been a year! I thought I'd jump back on board and share some of my tales from being on the other side of the hospital system. Sorry for the formatting and if it's a bit hard to read. I'm working on learning!

Be me, Fidgety Marathoner (FM)-5'2"", f, 103 lbs, struggling in anorexia recovery, but fighting my ass off! 

Be Shocked Coworker (SC)-6'1"", m, 180ish lbs, awesome nurse!

Don't be Hangry Planet (HP)-5'2, f, 410 lbs, hangry as a horse

I've been lurking around reading the stories over the past year, but haven't gotten around to writing any! I still have my tube and ostomy, but am doing well! I am in an accelerated bsn program and am working as an APCT. OK, I've deprived you of your McBeetus long enough, I'll take full responsibility if your sugahs have crashed! 
As mentioned in the title, I work on a general Med/Surg unit, meaning I've seen it all. We have plenty of moons, hams, and solar systems at any given time. 80% are fine and do what they can to get out, 20% treat us like shit, refuse to cooperate, and expect this to be a hotel to cater only them. We're busy and I typically have about 12-16 patients after 3PM (them staffing ratios). Dinner comes around 5:15. 
It was a relatively slow evening and all the blood sugars had been taken and SC had administered his insulins as the food arrived. It should be noted that the patients' call bells ring directly to phones that all the nurses and PCTs carry around. I receive a call from HP and all I can make out is ""FOOD!!!"" and some huffing and gasping. SC and I exchange looks as this lady is one of the 20% who refuses to walk like she should, gets angry if it takes more than 2 mins to get to her room (and will SOIL HERSELF ON PURPOSE if we don't get there soon enough to get her a juice or another pillow), and has been needy since she arrived the day before..for uncontrolled Beetus. I walk down to HP's room.

FM: Hi HP, sorry I could not understand what you were saying over the phone, how can I help you? 

HP: *Picks up cane and comes charging at me* what is this bullshit dinner they are trying to serve me?? This isn't enough to sustain a dying cat!!! 

Now she's on a carb limited diet (still allotted 60g per meal) for the Beetus, but her dinner is a large piece of baked cod (it's good, I've had it!), broccoli and carrots, mashed potatoes with gravy and a side of margarine, no sugar added chocolate pudding, a dinner roll, a no sugar added fruit cup, and 2% milk. 

FM: I'm sorry you feel like it's not enough, but this is the typical dinner portion size most of our patients get (shit, my mistake..).

HP: *wheeze* What do you mean ""most""!!?? This is a child's portion! Why did they send me a child's portion! It must be on the wrong floor! *wheeze* 

FM: HP, different patients are ordered different diets and different portions. We do not have a children's floor, this is an adult portion. Why not just try to eat it and see how you feel afterwards?

HP: *harrrrrumph*

**Not much later**
*Phone rings*
FM: I'll be right down HP.

I get in to the room and the ENTIRE tray is annihilated. Not a scrap left.

HP: ORDER ME MORE FOOD! (I get handed a looong list of food items she wants, mostly french fries, ice cream, juice, cookies) I am STARVING!! How dare you try to deny me nourishment?! *gasp for breath* I have the Beetus and NEED more than that so I don't go in to shock!!! 

*But that's not how this works, that's not how any of this works!*
FM: I will have to check with your nurse and he might have to call the doctor. I'll let you know as soon as I can! 
HP goes APESHIT on me! 

HP: YOU ANOREXIC BITCH!!! YOU HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT MY CONDISHION! I KNOW WHEN MY SUGAHS ARE LOW!! 
HP *stands up, throws a dirty chuck pad at me, throws the tray towards me (it missed), and kicks the trashcan at me*

SC and another nearby nurse enters: What the hell?!! FM are you ok?? (I am) HP, if you don't stop I'm calling security!!! 

HP: SC, FM purposely is refusing to order me more food and my sugahs are low!! I need more than a kid's meal!! *gasps for breath*

SC: Your blood sugar about 35 mins ago was 250!! Your dinner was prescribed by the doctor to help you manage your Beetus! And FM would have had to check with my anyways! I'm reporting this to the charge nurse (oh shit son..have you ever seen a pissed off charge nurse??) and FM will be rechecking your sughas! 

I recheck for 290. What the what?? 

SC does some awesome nurse stuff and the next day HP is transferred to a more intensive unit as her sugahs are out of control. We later find out that she had stores of candy (including packs of FUN DIP!!!!!) and chocolate in her personal belongings that she clearly had been eating the entire time!

",Med/Surg HANGRY Planet!
fatpeoplestories,"Longtime lurker here. Decided to share my own story about my mom on a throwaway. Turned out longer than I thought it would, so I've added a summary at the very bottom. Apologies if my formatting is off. 

My mom was not always a hamplanet. In fact, several years ago she used to be far from it. She led a very active and healthy lifestyle - never ate any junk food and exercised frequently, even running a couple half marathons and 10Ks a year - and she was super skinny because of it. 

The only time she ever really indulged was during the holiday season every year when she would relax some of her dietary restrictions, slack a bit on exercising and gain a little bit of weight. It was never very much (5-10 pounds at most probably), and she would always lose it usually by the end of January. It never seemed like a big deal, but this is actually one of the biggest factors in her weight gain and descent into hamplanet status in my opinion. I will come back to this in a bit. 

Another huge (pun intended) factor is my mom's boyfriend (""Big Bob"") that she started dating again (they dated in high school) right around the time she started putting on weight, which isn't a coincidence.  

Big Bob is actually a nice guy for the most part, but he is a full on hamplanet and has been for as long as I’ve known him. He's about my height (5'9'') and easily 350 pounds if not more. I looked at body comparisons before I wrote this to try and estimate his weight, and none I saw for his height were even close to being as big as him so he might even be closer to 400. In any case, he's a big guy. Big enough that he has tons of problems with his knees/feet/legs that prevent him from working because he can't walk very well or stay on his feet for more than a couple minutes and he isn’t qualified for office work, so he collects some form of assistance. You would think that his lack of mobility would prompt him to make some changes, but he doesn't. He continues to guzzle sweet tea and binge on extremely unhealthy foods all while blaming his health problems on condishuns or bad family genes and getting older. He also hates it when his doctors say anything about his weight because he claims that being fat doesn't make you unhealthy or mean you will die young/have health problems. He loves to cite the rare examples of fit people dying of a heart attack or freak accident as proof that weight doesn't matter. You just ""go when you go and there's nothing you can do about it."" 

Note that when they first started dating Big Bob still worked part-time and was a little active even though he still had problems with his knees/feet/legs, but not anymore.

Anyway, so my mom starts dating Big Bob right around January of my sophomore year in high school, and nothing changed at first and really for a while. Big Bob ate his fatty foods and my mom still ate healthy and exercised a lot. Then about a year later they moved in together, or I should say Big Bob moved in with us. That was when things started to change. 

As a result of Big Bob moving in suddenly our house was stocked with a never ending supply of junk food, and slowly my mom started snacking on it mostly due to Big Bob always trying to share his food with her. ""Here have a piece of pie."" ""Try some of these new Oreos."" ""I brought you a bowl of ice cream, too."" He was always offering her food. She turned most of it down at first but then over time started accepting it. 

My mom also significantly cut back on her cooking after he first moved in because Big Bob refused to eat what she made which was normally healthy food, and instead she started eating from the same restaurants Big Bob liked because it was convenient for her to get something for herself since she had to pick up his food from those restaurants. Eventually she started cooking again but she now made the fatty foods he liked, and she ended up eating them too. 

The final change that led to my mom's weight gain was Big Bob complaining about her exercise schedule. She always ran or went to the gym after work, but Big Bob started complaining that she never had any time for him after work anymore because she spent so much time at the gym or running even though really she spent like an hour or hour and a half max and this was something she also did before he ever moved into our house. He thought that the whole point of moving in together was to spend more time together and she should change her routine so that she could sit on the couch with him and watch TV. My mom finally caved and decided to starting working out in the mornings before work, but the problem is she didn't. She would oversleep or just not get up in time, so she started missing a couple of workouts a week consistently. 

Sort of a side issue too was that she just in general became less active. Big Bob didn't walk or do much to stay active, so when Big Bob moved in my mom spent more time with him and that also meant more time sitting around.  

The combination of these things led to my mother slowly starting to put on weight, but it was very gradual at first. I would guess not more than 20 pounds by fall. It was definitely noticeable but just barely because she was so fit before the weight gain. 

That holiday season, though, was when my mom really began her journey to hamplanet status. As I said earlier, my mom had a bad habit even when she was at her fittest of slacking on her diet and exercise during the holidays. She did the same that year, but it was much worse with Big Bob being around with all of his junk food plus him encouraging her to take it easy and not worry about her diet or exercise. My mom did just that and straight up gorged her way through late October until early January. She also all but quit exercising by the weeks leading up to X-mas. By the time January arrived she was without a doubt overweight. She blew up so fast it was like she was a balloon. 

Of course during this time she made comments about needing to lose weight, stop eating so much and start being more active again, but Big Bob just told her to wait until after the holidays and that is exactly what she did. 

She tried getting back into her routine after the New Year, but she would only stick with it for a few days before she'd fall back off the wagon for a few days or a week - really until something happened to remind her of how fat she'd gotten. This continued on and off for the next couple of months. She'd claim she wanted to change, but she'd never really try to stick with her plan. 

It didn't help that Big Bob continued to encourage her to stick with his lifestyle and constantly told her something to the effect of “real men like curves.” I guess that is what my mom wanted to hear because by about the time summer arrived she had quit making any attempts to exercise or stay active and had all but given up on a healthy diet. She instead started repeating Big Bob's line about women needing to have ""curves"" and starting getting into the body positive thinking - i.e., there is nothing wrong with being overweight or obese and the fact that she'd gained a lot of weight so quickly wasn't a problem at all. She also started complaining about having a thyroid problem that was causing her to gain or claiming it was genes like Big Bob always does, yet she never even went to the doctor to have it checked out.

She also started doing this weird thing were she’d act like if she ate a salad with an unhealthy or meal then somehow magically it's a healthy meal or a smoothie is healthy because it has fruit even though it has tons of calories. I really think now she was just in denial and trying to make herself feel better because she honestly knows better than that.

By the time I left for college in the fall she had pretty much merged into Big Bob's lifestyle. She would gorge on exactly the same foods as he would and was increasingly sedentary. It was sad in a way because I knew that if I wanted to do something with her she'd complain if she had to do much walking but blame it on being ""tired"" even though by this point she did very little outside of sit down all day at work and then at home. Really she would avoid any activities that required much physical exertion, and she would do things like take the elevator rather than the stairs when given the option and park as close as she could to the door if she was shopping. Usually it was pretty close since she would always use Big Bob's disability sign so she could use one of the handicap spots, which was disgusting and something that made me lose a lot of respect for her. 

On a side note, it was pretty hard to watch her struggle so much to walk around campus with me during move in weekend and it was also embarrassing. She was so out of shape that she had to stop and rest every so often. I will never forget that. 

From there everything just kept getting worse. Every time I came home from school she was always bigger, and she just kept gaining weight. I am not really surprised though since she no longer restrained herself when it came to how much she ate and what she ate. She seemed to always be snacking on something and gorging herself (literally eating to the point where she'd complain about having a stomach ache), and what made it even more outrageous was that we could go out for a meal and she'd eat a ton and then would come home and eat dessert and then a late-night snack later. She also continued to get less and less active. 

When she first started dating Big Bob, they looked mismatched, but now they look like they belong together. She is not as large as he is but she’s not far from it. 

Of course, I have tried to explain to her how bad all of this is for her and point out her lifestyle change whenever she complains about her mysterious thyroid condition or hereditary that she claims is responsible every time she finds out she has gained more weight, but she won’t listen and actually gets mad at me. She says I am not a doctor so I don’t know what I’m talking about, so mostly these days I don’t say anything. 

Tl;dr: My mom starts dating an old boyfriend who is massively overweight now,slowly adopts his lifestyle and fat logic and puts on a lot of weight over several years. She now is without a doubt a hamplanet that blames her weight gain and health issues on her thyroid and heredity even though she used to be in shape and never had these issues then.

fatpeoplestories,"yesterday concluded the end of my official mock trial season as we made it to the semi-finals but didn't progress due to a point differential. bummer, but considering the team i'm on (our school's b-team) is mostly people who just started, our coach tells us we have done great (hells yeah)

with the exception of one: lindsey the ham. lindsey isn't the best on the team, despite claiming to have been a mock trial star at her old school. in my last story, lindsey and her equally rotund friend elissa basically stole money from me and also accused a teammate of being a bitch to her, mainly typical ham behavior. 

in this installation, i will tell about how lindsey burned a hole both through our city's restaurants and our coach's wallet. first, we went to a local cafe after we were done competing friday, since each competing team had two rounds, but there were three rounds in total leaving everyone with a break of around 1-2 hours. our break was the third round, so we took advantage of it and decided to get coffee. i stuck close to my best friend, (let's call her avery) and we basically isolated ourselves from lindsey and elissa, but sat near enough everyone else on the team (who are nice and non-planets), waiting for another friend to join us.

avery and i order our drinks and i order a brownie as well since i was hungry and didn't think to bring any snacks along. lindsey walks by our table, clutching a plate with a huge hunk of chocolate cake garnished with a strawberry, and looks at my brownie in confusion. 

""that's a small-ass brownie,"" remarks lindsey. the brownie was of considerable girth, but if your had has trouble fitting into gloves, i guess everything is small. 

""not really,"" i return, just wanting to talk to a about our performances and other stuff.

""the a-team's being dicks again because they won and shit.""

""we won too. they're just super happy because most of them are graduating this year.""

""that team is so stuck-up. elissa and i are the only normal sized ones on either of the teams."" first of all, being normal-sized means that your weight and height are proportional, not that you can tuck in your fupa like a child at night. second, being stuck-up is bragging about yourself, not celebrating a victory.

lindsey left and joined elissa in an obvious effort to isolate themselves from ""the anorexics"", and partook in a sugar filled feast. on their table was three large frappes, two more slices of cake, and a coke, presumably all for them. 

everyone took else took about thirty minutes to eat and finish their drinks, while lindsey and elissa gobbled their food within the first ten minutes. when you can see a beetus fest, it's quite hard to turn away, almost like witnessing a car crash.

when everyone finished, we began to walk two blocks to get dinner at a pizza place. lindsey and elissa lit up like christmas trees, but complained every step of the way as they trailed behind the rest of us. when we got there, i sat with avery and aforementioned normal sized friend (let's call her summer) and a new character (let's refer to him as daniel).

sadly, there weren't many tables available but our table had six seats, two empty. summer, being incredibly nice, let elissa and lindsey join us. due to conflicting allergies (summer having a gluten intolerance and me having a seafood allergy) me, avery, and daniel decided to order separate slices, while summer ate her own packed lunch. elissa and lindsey. however, ordered an entire pizza for themselves.

when the food arrived (rather quickly), we decided to dig in, though elissa and lindsey dug faster than a man with gold fever. avery, daniel, and i finished our individual slices (which are the equivalent of two slices) in about 15 minutes, since we were all chatting. elissa didn't say anything and kept eating, while lindsey tried talking through mouthfuls of cheese and sauce. when it came time to pay, lindsey and elissa started to look queasy (and it wasn't because the two of them demolished a pizza by themselves).

lindsey put her card on the table for the waitress with a nervous expression, and after a few minutes, the waitress came back gave it back to her. 

""honey, your card has been declined.""

""i don't have any money,"" declared lindsey. elissa sat in silence, so we also knew she didn't have anything.

""we'll figure something out,"" said lindsey, causing the waitress to walk off and postpone her phone call to the police.

""do any of y'all have any money?"" asked elissa.

""how much was your bill?"" asked daniel bravely.

""$25."" the hams got three extra toppings and extra sauce on an already saucy pizza.

""there's our coach, he'll figure something out,"" i declared as he began walking by to check on us. though it might be rude, none of us had any intention on paying for elissa and lindsey's bill due to their rudeness and just plain idiocy.

""my card was declined,"" blurred out lindsey.

""too bad you can't send your pizza back. seems like you guys demolished it,"" joked our coach, assuming everyone at the table ate.

""that pizza was nothing. that was just for me and elissa,"" said lindsey causing our coach to appear slightly shocked.

""how much was the bill, i'll pay for it,"" offered our coach, in an extremely nice gesture.

""twenty five dollars."" our coach reached for his wallet and placed his card on lindsey's receipt.

lindsey and elissa smiled widely, and thanked him softly, while he nodded and mentioned about buying another Red Bull.

i guess anyone will need wings to deal with hams.

tl;dr hams of a very spherical shape are angered about the a-team's so-called snobbiness, demolish enough food for an average american family, and force our incredibly nice coach to pay for their pizza so the police aren't called and we don't have to appear in court for real.


",mock trial ham part 2
fatpeoplestories,"I work out at our university’s campus gym three times a week around the same time, early in the morning. Every now and then I see this cute petite girl who’s obviously very fit and toned, follows a vigorous and complex exercise routine which I admire given that I’m not the most athletic person. Oh and she’s also on our university’s cheerleading team, so I’ll call her CheerGirl. This week I notice her walking into the gym, hauling behind her a round Ham. They’re both around 5’6, but Ham looks like she’s around 200 pounds. I later learn that this fatty is actually her younger SISTER who is a freshman and lives with the pair’s other divorced parent. Let’s call her HamSister. The second thing I noticed about HamSister after her size was the heavy face full of makeup she put on coming into the gym - she had false eyelashes and purplish eyeshadow and too much contouring. As they set up it becomes clear that CheerGirl has obviously brought her HamSister to the gym to help out her out; she’s really supportive of her, tells her to only do as much as she feels comfortable, drink water, etc. HamSister looks somewhat indifferent and bored. CheerGirl demonstrates some exercises and explains how to use some kind of fitness app to HamSister, and then does her regular workout while instructing her sister to do a MUCH less intensive version of it alongside her. HamSister kind of follows along, in really poor form and unable to do more than a few reps at once. Whenever she stops she complains about:  


* some kind of body pain or dizziness
* being tired and sleepy so early in the morning
* how her pants are too tight around the ankle
* how she doesnt want to mess up her makeup
* How she needs to buy brand-name sports bras and leggings from Nike and Puma like her sister in order to exercise properly
* How going to a public gym is gross and exposes your body to “sweat germs”  



I feel like at regular daytime hours I would not have been able to hear or see all of this interaction, but it’s about 7:30 am and there’s only about 5 people in this part of the gym. About 20 minutes in HamGirl starts fumbling this fanny pack thing on the floor beside her, which I thought was going to contain an inhaler or something but nope, she pulls out 3 energy bars (like chocolate CLIFF bars) and a blue powerade. Once CheerGirl notices she’s already done her second bar, and she nervously tells HamSister that food isn't allowed in the gym for sanitary reasons. HamSister mumbles something about not eating enough for breakfast, and how she needs to have some kind of sugary drink while exercising or else she feels dizzy. For the rest of the time she’s barely trying and mostly just sitting on the machines taking up space and sending selfies on Snapchat. I swear at one point she brings over two 5-pound weights from the rack and places it on the floor just to get it in the picture. Anyways, I found this scene to be incredibly entertaining but also really upsetting because I’m sure her CheerGirl sister really brought her here with good intentions. I look forward to what will happen at their next gym session.

“It’s probably mostly water, I’ll do a three day cleanse (which never comes) and it’ll go away” 

“Staying in recovery from my eating disorder means not counting calories so aggressively...I’ll stop counting after work”

“The serving is 4, but that one is small so I’ll just have 1 extra...”

“I eat so many vegetables I’m probably over estimating my calories on the other stuff so this is going to balance out overall” 

I’ve packed on about 6lbs and just took a good hard look at what I’ve been allowing myself to get away with.    It’s only six lbs but that’s a dress size and I can really see it and feel it in my clothes.  I’m a recovering bulimic and while I’ve never been skinny, I had gotten to a very healthy weight and pursuing athletic goals that helped me find ways to appreciate my body that didn’t have to do with emptying it of all food.  I looked awesome before thanksgiving.  Anyone who rides the bulimia bus knows how long it takes to get to a place where you can look at yourself and really like what you see.  That was at thanksgiving.  Which was MONTHS ago.  

Today I see a doughy flabby beast.  With no self control and an entitled selfish mindset.  I go through usernames but I’ve been around over a year.  I want to turn this thing around and make it.

fatpeoplestories,"Hey everyone! I've decided to share a tale that involves slightly less uncontrollable rage and rustled jimmies than my first story, hope you enjoy!

In the first part of this story, I'm 10yrs old and at summer camp. It was one of those day camps where your parents place you while they work and you do ""bonding activities"" until they pick you up. 

Anyway, at lunchtime on the first day, everyone has made new friends, and is sitting with them. Everyone, that is, except me and the Ham of this story, who I'll call Gonnamakeit (GMI), because she's gonna make it. Because I was a pretty shy kid, I kept to myself during the activities, and if we did a team sport, I was quite happy to stay in the background and let other people play (I'm pretty hopeless at running, and throwing, and catching, etc.). GMI, on the other hand, had an attitude and voice that weren't doing her any favours. She wasn't mean, or deliberately annoying, per se, but she had a pretty whiny voice, and complained a lot about how difficult sports were for her. She was about ten years old, but already about 80kg (~175lbs), so in a sports camp, she wasn't going to be babied either. 

At lunch, as I was trying to build up courage to go and talk to someone, I noticed GMI was sitting by herself, looking pretty lonely, and went over to try to start a conversation (I can hear your screaming in the comments already). I went over, and we started chatting. It was a bit awkward, and we didn't really have much in common, but we didn't want to be the only two in the room without friends, so we tried extra hard to be nice to each other, and each make at least one friend. 

She was actually really nice, and seemed really interested in what I had to say... until we started talking about food. (Deep breath, here it comes). She insisted that she never got given enough to eat by her dad, and that he was deliberately starving her. (Now, I've met her dad since then, and that is entirely not the case, as you'll see later - he's a great guy, who wants the best for his daughter). Naive 10yr old me thought that she was telling the truth (she didn't appear to have a lunchbox, but I later learnt that she ate all of her food during our first break), and felt awful for her (I think you can guess what happened). I offered her some pieces of mango and persimmon, which she took and snaffled. 

A weird look came over her face; she ran to the bin, and she spat them out. 
""What is this, it tastes so weird?"" (Persimmon is REALLY sweet, and a tiny bit of an acquired taste, but I didn't think her reaction would be that violent)
""Just fruit"", I said.
""Oh, well it tastes strange, I don't like it. But thanks anyway""

I didn't think anymore of it until it was time to go home. When her dad came to pick her up, GMI practically leapt at him (poor guy) and said, and I quote: 
""Daddy, I had such fun today, I did lots of sports, and petametre gave me some healthy fruit""
I mean, she took maybe two bites of persimmon, but whatever, I won't judge. Her dad, however, is looking delighted, and replied with:
""Really? You really loved the sports and fruit? Well then, I'll make sure to get you lots of fruit next time we go to the market, and I'll sign you up to that tennis club that I was telling you about""
Guys, the way her face dropped was seriously comical. I think that her father was looking for an excuse to nudge her to lose the weight, and be more active, and it was obvious that she'd accidentally played right into his trap when she tried to boast about her ""healthy day"".

""That story's all well and good, but not really very gratifying"", I hear you already typing in the comments. Don't worry, it gets better. About 5 years after this story, I'm minding my own business in town, when I'm hit by a blonde and very happy bullet. Its GMI, but she's now 15, around 60kgs, (~130lbs), really pretty and babbling about how thankful she is to me for kickstarting the change in her life. I'm then approached by her father, who thanks me profusely for giving her the nudge and helping him change her bad eating habits. It takes me about 10 minutes to get the message across that I didn't really do anything, and another 20 minutes for them to stop thanking me anyway, but the experience left me in a good mood for the rest of the week.

So yeah, that's the gratifying ""Ham turns her life around story"" that I was lucky enough to witness (and set in motion, if I really flatter myself), and hopefully it was enough to soothe the rustled jimmies of the last story. Be warned though, none of my other experiences with Hams have gone this well.",A gratifying story
fatpeoplestories,"First time poster, yadda yadda (sorry for any formatting issues!). Actual need for help, folks, please, so I hope this is suitable for this sub. 


I love my friend, M. She is genuinely one of the sweetest, most helpful, hardworking and sincere people I’ve met. Sure, she can get a bit annoying at times, but who isn’t? 


When I first met her, she was…well, fat (around 95-100 kg/209-220 lbs easily), claiming to have gained most of it from being hospitalized from an accident, and is the furthest thing from a hambeast you could imagine. Her older sister as well is pretty plump from after having her first baby and they both hail from a geographic region of the country known for its delicious, if pretty oily, savory food. While I haven’t met her sister, M is a wonderful person – no hamtitlement, no demanding others cater to her needs, nothing! But recently she’s begun to espouse a few disturbing forms of fatlogic that I’m worried will hurt her later. 


As of a few days, it’ll officially be a year since I began eating clean and working out seriously, a few months since I began lifting heavy too. I’ve seen changes within weeks, not just to my body but to my hair, skin, my overall physical and mental health. I work in school environments around the city and state where you’re always on your feet so I’m pretty active all day long and walk up to 10-12 kilometers a day (in all) for travel to and from work. I also work out pretty religiously, twice a day, simply because it’s enjoyable; my first love will probably always be strength training, followed by HIIT, as of a few weeks back, I’ve started running in the mornings and thoroughly enjoy it too. 


Since beginning (75 kg/165 lbs) I’ve lost around 16 kg/35 lbs (wasn’t the most disciplined with diet either, though I’ve gotten better) and now at 159.5 cms/5’2, stand at 59 kg/130 lbs. Still got a few more vanity pounds to go! At my heaviest, I never looked ‘fat’ – I’m lucky (?) to have the kind of hourglass figure that makes you look great in lingerie and like a Pom bottle when covered up, unfortunately – and my whole life, I never imagined I could ever be ‘slim’ or fit-looking like I vaguely do now. I also happen to have hypothyroidism for which I initially began a dose of medication but stopped midway, electing to control it simply through cleaning up my diet and working out regularly for its own sake. I refuse to believe it’s a weight-loss death sentence and neither should anyone who has it! As of a few weeks ago, my blood work shows all thyroid hormone levels as normal and a full report my doctor is delighted with (she seriously couldn’t recognize me when I walked into her office a year after when I was visiting her in the city I’m originally from). 



Enter M, who has a similar interest in getting fit and healthy – I encourage this girl to the point of hyperbole, link her to meal plans, send her customized workouts I made up myself for when I didn’t have a laptop (I prefer working out at home, not comfortable with gyms), offer to cook healthy together…most are met with enthusiasm but I never know what exactly she’s actually doing because she looks almost exactly the same as when we met almost a year back. I understand habits are hard to change and getting healthy requires huge lifestyle changes in some cases, but our job requires us to travel lots and be on our feet a lot too, so I feel it’s a step in the right direction for her. I’ve since explained the concept of calculating your BMR and TDEE to her, (and most of our friends from office – I’m seen as the official health nut), keeping portions sensible and eating responsibly, though I’m not sure how much of it actually registered. 



What worries me are a few of her habits.



1)	Girl claims to ‘eat healthy’ and work out regularly with weights. Great! This is wonderful! Would be even more wonderful if every time we hung out it wasn’t to watch her inhale an entire pizza in one go, followed with several heaped portions of the worst food around. 



2)	The three of us (including another friend, S who is herself somewhat chubby but has zero fatlogic) end up spending money on travel way more than we need. We live in a city known for its absolutely glorious pleasant weather – the reason I’m able to walk around so much is simply because of the lack of humidity (in my home city, I’d be a puddle of sweat due to this very reason). Something as small as a five minute walk to a bus stop will be vetoed because ‘It makes me sweat too much!’ M is originally from a part of the country where dry heat is the norm and temperatures soar to 47 degrees (Celsius) – almost 116 degrees Fahrenheit – and I’ve no idea what she’s going to do there when she transfers back there for the same job, likely living with her family where I dread the thought of the kind of food habits they have (most of her family members being on the larger side themselves). 



3)	‘I need to eat every two hours or my metabolism will get messed up!’ – repeated verbatim from a conversation just yesterday. S and I kept our lunch limited to a burger alone (no fries or even Coke) and a single scoop of ice cream while she had two, packing in one more for later along with fries and a huge Coke. Yes, of course this can help – but with nutrient-dense foods, not calorie-dense McBeetus! 



4)	To her credit, M claims to follow a mostly vegetarian diet, though is okay with non-vegetarian meals too. I’ve offered several times to cook healthy white meat alternatives together, but these plans just never seem to work out for some reason and its back to pizza. Veg pizza, yes. All six slices of it, a few times a week. I even offered to make her a trail mix Ziploc bag like I have (walnuts, almonds, freeze dried strawberries – none of the chocolate or granola, unfortunately) to graze on throughout the day, but nope. 



5)	‘My friend gained weight because of her thyroid!’ It took a few deep breaths to explain as patiently as possible that no, your friend is fat because she ate like a pig, her thyroid might have flared up simply because of the stress she was putting her body in (like it did with me in university), lack of proper sleep, lack of adequate nutrition…yes, of course it can contribute to weight gain but not by very much and is completely controllable through eating clean and staying somewhat physically active and taking your meds on time (the last of which I don’t prefer for myself but freedom to choose, of course). 



6)	Introducing her to my Tinder profile and gently explaining why I always include full body pictures – I simply will not stand for being fatfished and will walk right away from a date if so; won’t stand for being lied to – when seeing she’s only got face pics or those taken from the selfie/Myspace angle which admittedly, do make you look somewhat more slender. ‘But the guys on here are all so ugly!’ Honey, you don’t have any right to comment on others’ looks when you’re not being honest on your own – girl has a beautiful face, but unfortunately carries fat everywhere from the neck down, back fat, arm rolls, elbow dimples…to put it crudely, she’s a complete butterball. A moon, if you will. From some of the stories here on the horrors of fatfishing dates, I understand the reaction and don’t want her ending up getting insulted or ridiculed…or worse.  



Girl also snores like a revving engine - seriously, it sounds like a foghorn blast in the night coupled with a growling toilet. Sleepovers at any of our places are awkward because at some point, I might roll over and find my other friends all lying wide-eyed and awake, unable to sleep because of the ridiculously loud snoring from M's side/mattress. She's 24 years old, I don't think sounding like a walrus while sleeping is normal. Adding to this is the space situation - she takes up more than half the bed in most cases, leading to the rest of us awkwardly shuffling around trying to fit in somewhere or the other. I slept on the floor on top of my yoga mat once claiming it was good for my back (it was actually kinda comfortable!) because I didn't want to create a fuss when she occupied most of the space on the bed, leaving poor S to cling awkwardly to the side in an attempt to not tumble off (I think I slept better than she did, definitely). 


Another memory that comes to mind is a couple of us from work putting together a five minute dance to some popular newly-released song for this silly talent show activity our managers had organized and which everyone participated in - M confidently states to us she didn't need to practice along for any dance steps (which we were getting off a Youtube video), she'd 'done this a million times before' with her friends from college. It was encouraging to see how assured she was...until the actual talent show night where she could barely keep up with the steps, panting and gasping and red in the face from basically two or three minutes of skipping around. I've seen a video of us that another friend took - the entire performance was shabby and uncoordinated because of M taking up so much space, doing the wrong steps and at one point, having to give up completely. 



Now I understand completely that endurance and stamina doesn't occur overnight - every elite athlete started off as a panting wreck - but this from someone who claims to work out regularly? Seriously? I always get the feeling M is trying to justify her habits to me personally and want nothing more than to tell her she has no reason to do so, she's my friend and I accept her, and only owes it to herself to straighten herself out. Not for me, not for anyone - only for herself. 



I don’t know what to do anymore besides keep my opinion to myself unless specifically asked. I love this girl and only want good things for her, I really want to build her up and be as supportive as possible simply because she’s worth the effort. I’ve explained everything to her as much as possible when asked – CICO, steady-state cardio not always being the best, exercise being secondary to weight loss when compared to diet…I just don’t feel right not saying anything when I see her falling into the ‘But I’m a foodie!’ trap and even worse, muh condishuns. Even S has begun to notice and comment privately on M’s eating habits, the discrepancy is simply too much. 



Please help me, FPS. Is it even my place to comment or be concerned? Am I being conceited? Have you had this conversation with someone you love?

fatpeoplestories,"Hi! Sorry for my long ass hiatus, my bulimia came back with a vengeance and I haven’t left the house or been online in a week. But you don’t really want to know about that, you want to know what everybody’s favorite Hambeast did.

Which leads me into a little back story for this: my friend who we’ll call Bean, because she is smol and stupid, at this point in time had come out to me as bisexual and I was the proudest gay mama ever. So naturally I took her tiny bi ass under my skinny wings so she wouldn’t end up being like me. (Gotta love starting every morning with a cup of internalized self hatred and inability to say no.) And one thing I did with her was take her out for coffee a lot so we could talk and catch up. I am a girl. I am feminine. I am white. OF COURSE I’M GOING TO POST PICTURES OF MY COFFEE, ON INSTAGRAM. And what else is on Instagram? Hamley Quinn, destroyer of puddin’, breaker of relationships, she hurts my heart by breathing because I feel like the diabetes comes through the phone. 

I posted a picture of my coffee and Bean on the Instagram. With the caption: ‘What a sweetie, and I’m not talking about the coffee. ;)’ 

*NEE NAW NEE NAW*

Oh no children, it’s the MUH CURVES POLICE! Hide your honesty, hide your logic!

HQ: SOY WHO THE FUCK IS THAT
Me: Oh you mean Bean?
HQ: YES THE FUCK I DO WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE
Me: Sorry?
HQ: YOURE ON A DATE WITH ANOTHER GIRL
Me: Oh! Not like that, Bean is just a friend.
.
.
.
Me: Hamley, did you try to send Bean a message telling her to keep away from me
HQ: I don’t want you hanging around her.
Me: Hamley, what the fuck.
HQ: YOURE MINE IM THE ONLY WHOLL EVER CARE ABOUT YOU. 
HQ: YOU SAVED ME I WAS SO ALONE BEFORE YOU
HQ: IF YOU LEAVE ILL DIE

OwO, Then perish.

Is what I should’ve said, but no. I dEciDEd tO vAliDaTe hER fUckEd uP beHaVioUR. What the everloving hell was I thinking.

Me: Hamley that’s not very nice, and I’m sure that you only mean well but Bean is my friend and needs support so I’d appreciate it if you didn’t do that kind of thing. 
HQ: YOU DONT GET IT
HQ: leave me alone for a while

So I left her alone for a while and went out to get a drink, it was a long night and I didn’t come back till around 23:00, 7 hours after Hamley had asked to be left alone. I checked my phone, and was greeted by oveR A HUNDRED MESSAGES
Telling me that: I WAS SUPPOSED TO BEG FOR HQ TO COME BACK
AND THAT I DIDNT APPRECIATE HER
HOW I WAS AWFUL
HOW SHE DIDNT NEED ME
WHY WASNT I RESPONDING
bitch bitch etc.
Hypocrisy etc.
So I message that I had been out and she tells me that we needed to swap phone numbers to which my immediate response was ‘No sorry.’
And then she didn’t talk to me for 3 months.
This is not the end
Oh boy.
This is not the end.

fatpeoplestories,"been lurking around here for some time, an decided to tell y'all my ham story.

when I was on the first or second grade, there was this fat kid I'll call Big J for now. not only he was pretty fat, but also he was a pretty big guy, about 10 or 20 cm bigger than me. I wasn't a small kid either, but was not as big as him. I was a pretty controverse kid. sometimes I made fun of Big J, and sometimes I was nice to him. don't really know why.

well, there was this time the school made a tour to the amusement park, it was a hot summer day, and the teachers would guide us through the park, take the lines, wait for everyone to go into the least dangerous attractions, then join the last groups and regroup after the rides.
so, there was this ride where we went into a log-shaped cart, it would go around, climb up and slide down to splash into a water tank. IMPORTANT: the cart had no backrest, it only had a long stool along the cart's lenght and we'd hold ourselves in two steel bars, one on each side. you could only lean your back on the last seat. poor security.

I was put into one of the last rides, with Big J right in front of me. I never understood why they didn't sit the biggest guy in the last seat, since we had no backrests, but there he was, right in front of me. I did not feel safe with that giant there, but the teachers didn't listen when I complained. ""oh, crap"" I thought. you see, Big J was not a smart kid. and everyone knew it. putting him in that place wasn't a smart decision either.

so, the cart started its course. I tried to put my leg up in the stool so it would stop Big J from falling over me, as I knew he would, but there was no room and no time for me to do it. then the cart started climbing. and Big J couldn't hold off his weight. and sooner than I expected, I was being crushed by his back, and I tried to hold mine and his weight with the sheer force of despair alone, but I couldn't, it was too heavy. so I did the stupidest thing to get him off me. I stood up and balanced so I wouldn't fall off the cart.

you see, the cart was not safe, since all we could do was hold on the bars, there was no safety-belt to stop us from jumping off the cart, and anyone could easily step out of it, since it was small.

as I stood up, we were at about 10 m high, and Big J fell over my legs, I couldn't move back to the seat. the car went down its course, fell through the water-fall, and when it hit the bottom, everyone was pushed ahead and I fell back into the seat, bumping my head in Big J's head. it was over and I never got close to him in school tours again.

TL;DR I almost died in a fun park because ham crushed me in a water ride.","Big J, the ham"
fatpeoplestories,"So, I am reading sagas like caterham and skyefalle, and I figured I'd share one of my stories.

To start, you need to meet me 
&gt; 23 year old software engineer. has cerebral palsy, which resulted in my left side being gimpy and me being nonverbal. [think of strong hand from scary movie 2](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/69274459/take-my-strong-hand.jpg), and a caved-in left leg.

&gt; I am sarcastic, witty, caring, but I'm a bit of a dick.

&gt;in this story's setting, I am 17.

I am at the movie theatre with my brother in my hometown. My brother goes to buy food or something, and I'm standing in the middle of a moderately populated lobby. there is room all around me, but I'm in the path from the door to the food. 

&gt; HipcheckableHam walks in, directly in my direction. She was a moody looking half-moon.
 
&gt; her path is obscurred by a cripple. Oh no!
 
&gt; ""get out of my WAY!!"" (mumbles ""fuckin'retard"")

Okay, that was rude. I see her go and order food, and what do you know- buddy I go to school with is working the cash she's at. This insensitive whale orders 2 sodas, 3 bags of popcorn, and candy. 
&gt; at this point, I reunite with my brother
As HipcheckableHam is done ordering, and we are walking by, I toss my cane up in the air and ""fall"" into her, which turned out to be more of a hip check than a stumble. 
  
&gt;ham drops all her food and stumbles into the counter to her right, and my brother exclaims ""OH NO YOU FELL!"" and picks me up barely containing his laughter
 
&gt; Í speak via my phone's text to speech, and say ""I am so sorry maám. you should have gotten out of the fuckin'retard's way!""

At this point, she, of course, goes to try to get a refund, but as I say, i knew the cashier from school, and i just gave him a stern look and a ""don't."" headshake. And, he says all sales are final and she should not be upsetting other moviegoers. 

So, we leave the pufferfish, and head towards the movie. She was not pleased when she rounded the corner and saw us dying of laughter

fatpeoplestories,"A couple of weekends ago my friend Amy and I went to a birthday celebration for a mutual friend that took place at a restaurant. Also in attendance were other friends and relatives of the mutual friend, most of which neither Amy or I knew. During introductions, we are acquainted with MOMMA HAM and BABY HAM. 

Momma Ham is very obese (probably somewhere around 350 pounds) and Baby Ham is her 3-year-old daughter who, unfortunately, under Momma Ham’s tutelage, is also obese. Not just chubby or chunky or still plagued with “baby fat” – but severely overweight for her age (maybe 60 to 70 pounds). 

After introductions, Amy and I sit. The seating is 2 tables with a booth on the wall side and regular chairs on the opposite side. Amy and I sit beside each other on the booth side, each of us on either side of the gap between the tables.  Momma Ham and Baby Ham are seated at Amy’s table, diagonally across from her. Momma Ham’s brother and his wife are also there, so they do more interacting among themselves while Amy and I make conversation with another person sitting across from me. 

Baby Ham is barely paying anyone but her family any attention and not being particularly noticeable one way or another. UNTIL Amy’s food order arrives, that is. Amy had ordered a turkey sandwich that came with a side of french fries. Within seconds of the waitress sitting Amy’s plate down, Baby Ham, who had barely registered Amy’s presence before then, made a beeline toward Amy through the gap between the tables under the guise of wanting to sit on her lap. 

It was a cute thing at first…we figured she was just being friendly and had taken a liking to Amy the way kids randomly do with people sometimes. But no, it wasn’t actually Amy’s attention she wanted, she wanted the french fries. She squeezed her way in between us to crawl onto Amy’s lap and started begging for some of the french fries. Momma Ham started laughing about it: “Haha…I knew that’s what she really wanted.” Oh, so you knew your kid’s intention was to beg a stranger for food – okay then. 

Now Amy, who is thin and watches her weight and food intake religiously, had not been planning to eat all of the french fries, so she was quite okay with sharing them. She had offered some to me and I ate a couple, and she had had a few herself, but in the meantime she was waiting for the waitress to bring out some tomato for her sandwich before she really dug in (she hadn’t realized the sandwich didn’t come with any). 

Well it’s a good thing Amy didn’t really care about her french fries, because Baby Ham proceeded to eat them ALL. You would figure that she would only eat a few, or that maybe her mom would exercise some manners on her child’s behalf and not allow her to completely demolish a stranger’s whole side order, but NOPE. Baby Ham proceeds to plow through Amy’s french fries. Amy managed to snag a few here and there but was ultimately no match for Baby Ham’s precision and speed. Momma Ham just sits there laughing about it, making lighthearted comments about how much Baby Ham eats. 

Around the time that Baby Ham was finishing off Amy’s french fries, the waitress came with my order – a cheeseburger. As soon as the waitress sat the plate down, Baby Ham zeroed in on the tomato on the burger and REACHED TO TRY TO SNATCH IT OFF! Keep in mind, I had not interacted with this little girl AT ALL the whole time I was there. She didn’t know me from Adam, and literally tried reaching for food right off my plate with no qualms. I told her no and moved my plate out of her reach. She moved a little closer and tried AGAIN. I repeated NO again and had to throw up my elbow to fend her away from my plate, thinking WTF!

She ended up turning her attention back to Amy because the waitress had brought out Amy’s tomato. Baby Ham then proceeds to try to snatch Amy’s tomato out of the bowl it was in. Amy ends up having to fight Baby Ham off of her tomato as well, and then says pointedly for Momma Ham to hear: “Sorry, this is for my sandwich, but maybe your mommy can order you some food because you seem to be hungry…”

Momma Ham hears Amy and picks up on the hint and orders Baby Ham her own food, finally. She remarks again on how much Baby Ham will  “eat anything and everything”  like it’s funny and cute. It’s not. Lady, your 3-year-old is obese and literally cannot stop eating to the point where she begs strangers for food and tries to scavenge food off their plates. This is not at all cute behavior.  Momma Ham even told some weird story about how they were once Facetiming with the dad, who happened to be eating something at the time, and Baby Ham was only focused on the food the dad had in his hand and asked him to save her some. This little girl, at THREE, is literally obsessed with food.

Baby Ham’s food comes out eventually. Momma Ham had ordered her a side of her own tomato and a platter of chicken tenders and fries. The establishment did not have a kids’ menu of any sort, so the platter she ordered was a normal one. But no biggie…any responsible parent who doesn’t want their child to over-indulge on an adult-size portion of fried food could simply split the portion up into something suitable and save some for later. Given that Baby Ham had already polished off almost a full order of (Amy’s) french fries on top of whatever else in the world she had already eaten that day (it’s only 3PM at this point), this might have been especially prudent for Momma Ham to do. But did this occur? NOPE. Baby Ham packed away the whole order of chicken tenders and fries. 

The fun doesn’t stop there though! Eventually the cake comes out and we sing to the birthday girl and she blows out the candles. The cake is a tall, round, 2-layer cake. Momma Ham happens to be the cutter and starts cutting industrial sized pieces of cake to pass around.  All of the adults are eyeing the pieces with big eyes because they are huge and no one really wanted a piece of cake that size. And Momma Ham is cutting them all the same way – not bothering to ask anyone what they would prefer but just assuming that everyone overeats the way that she clearly does. 

Amy politely asks Momma Ham if she could cut a smaller slice of cake for her. Momma Ham snaps at Amy that she can just take whatever she can’t eat home.  

Or, you know…you could just cut smaller pieces of cake since someone pointedly asked you to and the rest should really be for the person whose birthday is to be able to take home – but whatever, Momma Ham. So what really ends up happening is that most of the cake ends up going to waste because no one could really finish their slice nor was anyone really interested in saving it to take home. 

Except Baby Ham, of course. She scores a gigantic piece of cake on top of everything else she has eaten in a mere 2 hours and finishes it off, of course. 

And that was the story of our run in with a Momma Ham who is sadly already cultivating a Baby Ham. Keep in mind, I fully acknowledge that Baby Ham is only 3 years old and is being 100% enabled by Momma Ham and so my intention is not to make fun of her because she can’t help that her mother is raising her to have a very unhealthy relationship with food and to be obese. I mostly just think it is very sad. 

Momma Ham also had a 10-year old son there that is also overweight. And the husband, who was not there but that we saw through Facebook pictures, is overweight as well. So it’s clear to see that the whole family eats poorly and it’s disheartening to see that these kids are being raised with poor food habits and behaviors and will likely grow up to be obese like Momma Ham.

Hello FPS, just wanted a few words of advice. 


Being a broke-ass student means that I regularly find myself taking 3-4 hour long journeys on buses in the UK (those extra few pounds saved funds my whole foods addiction). 


I generally don't have issue with people on public transport - I'd rather take 10 mins of discomfort rather than making a scene (classic Brit). But it seems that lately, more...voluptuously blessed....individuals seem drawn to me. 

Logic is: 'she's not taking up all of her seat so it's fine if I use it/ more space for me!', then literally *crush* poor me against the wall. Today I've gotten off a three hour journey with excruciating shoulder pain because the man sitting next to me thought it was okay to take up literally half of my seat. I was sat there, literally wedged into a semi-hunched position so my one shoulder was painfully pushed against the window (it's still numb). Not to mention literally touching the person next to me from hip to ankle for the entire duration of a pretty hot, humid journey. I've politely asked them to move over a tiny bit, but after 15-20mins they slowly migrate back over to my side of the seat again...


Obviously I understand public transport is pretty horrendous for everyone involved, but I'm so fed up. Any advice on what to do? (no arm rests to act as a barrier here, and no escape either as cheapskate bus companies will oversell almost every journey, and you have to remain seated for the entire duration of the trip)

The orange Honda Fit's undercarriage scratches the entrance and that's how you know they've arrived. Why are they here, they were just here yesterday? The answer is simple, the buffet starts at 11, it's now 10:45am. A woman whose neck is thicker than my thigh leads the pod; slowly but surely they walk the 30ft to the restaurant and weight. Those 15minutes are an eternity though, blood sugars go down so they send the slimmest a petite 180-190lbs  5'5"" waif to the coffee shop. 4 blended, large caramel lattes with whipped cream blended in are made; whipped cream blended in makes them fluffier, both the drink and the drinker. Eventually the restaurant opens, the pod disappears for 45minutes emerging sweaty, this observation is made because they'll come back over for gelato sometimes. 
  
The Spit Roast
There once was a girl in a tight pink dress, a dress so tight on her ""curvee"" figure she looked like a spit roast. I think that's what those are called. Those giant pieces of meat cooked over a roaring fire? Except her dress had bulges everywhere. Anywho, Miss Spit asked for a green tea. Green tea typically isn't sweetened, I asked if she'd like it sweet. Her answer was ""no.""  I come in the next day and my coworker got a call from ~someone~ complaining that their green tea wasn't sweet enough.

I Don't Eat Anything That's Not Organic
This one happened today, an old woman whose skin was so wrinkled from years of smoking. You know that rubbery, wrinkled smokers skin. Well...in waddles the woman asking about coffee, I ask her the size...waiting...I have yo wait until she catches her breath. Guys, she walked in from the parking lot. Her car was no more than 20-30 ft away.  Eventually she asks about the our muffins, asks if they're organic, I say no.  ""I don't eat anything organic,"" her response word for word, then she ask for the cream and sugar...she went for the processed vanilla flavored one. Everytime she pulled a dollar to pay she had to let out a gasp of air. Smoking and obesity are not a pretty sight.

Poppy Seed Muffin

I did not know what a poppy seed muffin was until I was 21 yrs old. My family isn't much into backed goods or baking. We cook what we eat and that's it. My first week at work I had a  boar of a woman come in with her actually petite daughter. I've never feel worse for a kid having a fat parent. The mother asked me for the muffin names. I didn't know what a poppy seed muffin was so I did the next best thing, I took them out and showed the boar. I knew 3 out of 4. Guys, I got yelled at, I mean yelled at for not being able to name a poppy seed muffin. A muffin the boar new by name. She asked me if I knew what a muffin was, if I knew English.  Her poor daughter turned red. Needless to say, I really really dislike fat people.",Short stories from the coffee shop
fatpeoplestories,"Hello my dear friends, I must say that you have all been so kind to me and I very much appreciate the comments y’all leave. It warms my cold dead heart to just below freezing :) 

So you know what happens if you leave meat out and don’t refrigerate it, right? It goes bad, spoils, and starts to smell like the devil took a shit on your face. It sinks into your clothes, your skin, your very existence. Then the maggots come and all sorts of various unpleasantries. 

Now. I am not advocating refrigeration of Ham as we know it, that’s grounds for assault and such, minor matters really, but let’s stay out of jail. However, I feel a compromise would be to wash oneself, Hammy or otherwise, at least once daily. Under extraneous circumstances, perhaps at least weekly. However, I am here today to regale you the story of the Ham who had clearly not been acquainted with a bar of soap since birth. 

This day thus far was a good day. I had a partner who didn’t make me alternate between homicide and suicidal on a minutely basis. Let’s call him Dave. Dave was 18 and a new EMT; overall a cheery, happy, go-lucky kinda guy. While I am the very antithesis of Dave, I will occasionally extend my head out of my turtle shell and participate in “conversation”, I believe the word is. 

We listened to the radio most of the day, and the song “Don’t Let Me Down” by The Chainsmokers feat. Daya was on, as it was new so naturally the radio played it 6 times an hour. I am a chainsmokers fan, #SELFIE runs through my veins, but I cannot listen to that song now without getting flashbacks to ‘Nam. 

To give some brief background, there are multiple levels to an IFT company. Highest is the MICU (mobile ICU) which is normally 2 medics and a nurse. Sometimes it will be an EMT as driver (as I once was), a medic, and nurse. Most common situation on the regular rigs (for mostly non emergent transports) is either medic/medic, medic/EMT, or EMT/EMT. The bottom level is the wheelchair wagon, which is not staffed by any licensed healthcare provider such as EMT, medic, RN, but just someone with whatever the necessary certification is. It’s just one person in it, and they’re able to accommodate a wheelchair without making the patient get off it. 

Occasionally, there will be more wheelchair transports than there are wheelchair wagons (WW), and so it was the dual EMT team of Dave and I who were sent to pick up the focus of our story. 

We didn’t get much info from dispatch, since WW runs were not required/qualified to take any vitals, so it was just a pickup from a hospital and transport home. 

I should have known. I should have *KNOWN*. I hadn’t ever had a WW run before, so naturally the one I do get was bound to be an experience. Why had I even started working in EMS? Why was I alive? Why are any of us alive? What is the universe expanding into? WHAT IS OUT THERE? 

Anyway. 

We arrive at the hospital and check in with his current nurse. Her run down of him was “he’s big, he doesn’t know what’s going on, who he is, or where he is, but otherwise medically he’s fine. He wants to go home, so he’s going home.” Great. Dave and I stare at each other and feel doom caressing our cheeks and whisper sweet nothings into our ear, things like “hell is better than this”. We walk into the room and are pleasantly surprised - for one tenth of a second. 

He’s big, but I’m a seasoned veteran of Hammy McHamsters with a dash of extra Ham so I don’t bat an eyelash. Dave is new, so he hasn’t yet seen the gargantuan monstrosities than roam our earth and expect us to carry them on a stretcher. Patient is short, probably around 5 foot even, but pushing 250-300. Like a neutron star, he’s small but dense, and has a strong gravitational pull. Dave and I are yanked - I mean - we walk towards him, and I breathe in through my nose in preparation to open my mouth and tell him who we are and where we’re taking him. 

I immediately regret my decision with the intensity of a thousand million white hot suns. 

Imagine something died. And then some scavenger animal ate it, and then it died. Then another scavenger ate it and died on a stretch of highway in baking sun, laying there undisturbed for 12 years without fully decomposing. 

That was about half of the smell that assaulted my nasal cavity. I felt my nostril hairs curl up and die, my sinus cavities started voting for emancipation, my stomach gurgled and sent a hot wave of bile up my esophagus. Saliva flooded my mouth in preparation for the Linda Blair-esque projectile vomit that wanted nothing more than to coat 360 degrees of a 5 foot radius in plentiful barf. My eyes started to water like I lost a dear old friend. 

Dave. 

Oh, Dave. 

The poor kid is crying passively (i.e. there’s no stopping the tears, they just flow) and chewing on his tongue like he’s at NYC restaurant week and just took a bite of America’s best filet mignon. 

I steel myself against the putrid wave, and very carefully approach the stinky Ham (SH). Part of our usual routine is to asses how alert and oriented they are, abbreviated A&amp;O x4, meaning judging if they know person, place, time, and situation. So I would say “what’s your name, where are you, what’s today date, and who is president?”

For your worldly knowledge, most nurses use a scale of A&amp;O x3, which removes situation, but EMS likes all 4 because even numbers make me feel good. If the patient only knows who and where they are, they are A&amp;O x2. You get the picture. 

SH tells me his name, Omar, and says it’s May 1st, 2002, he’s in Haiti, and Bush Jr. is president. So it’s August something 2016, Obamarama is still prez (miss you bby), but again this is a WW call so we aren’t supposed to be doing anything other than transporting him, unless of course his health declines in our care. Also, his name isn’t Omar. It’s Darrell. However, SH is delighted to be going home because...

**NOTE: This is not intended to be seen/read/viewed as racist in any way, shape, or form; it is a statement of pure, unadulterated, fact. For your beetus cravings. Obv.**

This is a direct quote: “Thank god y’all here, there are too many damn darkies round this bitch.”

SH is black. Not light skinned. Not caramel toned. His skin tone is dark black. I’m as confused as I’ve ever been, but that’s life/EMS, so I just move on.

I explain that we have to move him over to the stretcher and such, he’s amicable and fine with everything. I’m on my last remaining air, so I run into the hallway to find Dave. Gasping for air, I call for him. He emerges from the shadows with red puffy eyes, and helps me move SH. We have a nurse assist us since the hospital bed is a little lopsided (under-funded hospitals are the best), and she comes in wearing a face mask. 

When health care professionals wear face masks around outrageously smelly patients, the mask is probably lined with peppermint rub (like Vick’s) to give your respiratory system a break. THANKS for the heads up nurse-dawg, really could have used some for us, but now isn’t the time to get into it, as I have to be mindful of my air consumption like some unfortunately placed scuba diver. 

We wheel SH out to the rig, and prepare to lift him in. You know, when you exert yourself, you tend to need more air to fuel your muscles. I couldn’t help but let his stench diffuse through my body, wreaking havoc on my respiratory system and will to live. 

Struggling against both his weight and his stank, we push him in and slam the door. Leaning against the ring, we’re bent over breathing the sweet smoggy city air which is as blissful as the breeze off the ocean. I can almost feel the sand under my feet. 

We collect ourselves, but horror crosses Dave’s face. I wonder what’s up until I realize that, due to our trade off system, it’s my turn to drive, meaning the poor kid is stuck in a 4x6 box of hell. 

He gives me a pleading, puppy-dog eyes look, which I respond to with “sorry bud” and hop into the driver’s seat. 

Unfortunately for me, there is no window/door between the front and back, so the aroma of death has already occupied my breathing air. I open the window and start driving, trying not to kill us by letting my inner dog take over and sticking my head out the window. 

Thankfully, the drive is short, and we unload Omar/Darrell/SH onto his front lawn, Dave’s eyes are still streaming. He hops right on up and waddles up the stairs, where another Ham and a man who is just skin and bones wait on the porch. I can only assume that the skinny man is last in the pecking order and there is no food left for him to eat. 

Given how he walked right away, I assume that he was transported by us because he wouldn’t have been able to get home on his own, and perhaps his fellow men on the porch didn’t want to have a generous application of barf stink applied to their car interior. 

O/D/SH lights up a cigarette as the other two men slide away from him, I can almost see the green cloud of fumes emanating from his body. He gives us a cheery wave and a “thanks sailors, prayers for more smooth seas!” 

In a moment of connecting with humanity, gross, I give him back an “aye aye mate” and return to the rig, for a second forgetting about the horrific atmosphere awaiting my return, ready to sink into my clothing, hair, lungs, and human essence. 

Dave speed-stomp-walks past me, growls “get IN”, takes the wheel, and floors it to the nearest Walmart. We tumble out, gasping, and beeline immediately to the cleaning products aisle, letting dispatch know that we need an hour to clean the rig. “For what??” For the against the Geneva accords chemical warfare of a patient you just made us pick up, that’s what. 

We thoroughly Lysol wipe the rig, febreeze it and ourselves so much that we’ll probably be the start of a new commercial in the future: “if you or a loved one has been exposed to more febreeze than any rational person should be around for life in less than an hour, call our lawyers today.”

The rest of the day was uneventful, I went home and took 3 showers, and prepared how I was going to quit my job. 

Till next time!

My local crunchy mommy group is big on designer baby carriers and social justice. There's a high end baby carrier company that posted [this picture](https://imgur.com/a/mK3c4) on their Instagram, and now the crunchy moms are all calling it ""fat shaming"" and talking about boycotting this company. 

... is it just me, or is this incredibly mild for ""fat shaming""? As a new mom, yes, I've got a few extra pounds... yes, I'm not looking the greatest these days, with little sleep... but I don't think this is exactly fat shaming. 

One of the other moms pointed this out and got yelled at about being privileged and how skinny people don't face half the difficulties that fat people do, so that skinny shaming isn't a thing but fat shaming is. (It may be worth mentioning that the local mommy group is all sizes and shapes, but the one who pointed it out and got yelled at was definite on the skinny side. It should be no surprise to anyone the ones who got the most worked about fat shaming and thin privilege were the... bigger ones.) 

I kind of see it as like being able to do a pull up. Some people are naturally strong and can knock 25 of them out their first time trying, some people will never be able do one, but most people will be able to do at least a few with consistent training and effort. Losing weight/getting fit is the same thing. Some people get it easier than others, but everyone can make an improvement with some work. I've got a few extra pounds because I don't say no to the donuts at work and I like my coffee with extra cream and sugar. But I don't care enough to change it (plus I'm still nursing) and I think that's okay too.

(Edited to add, two days later) 

Update: people still bitching and fighting on the thread, with some moms saying that talk of weight loss and fat shaming is very triggering and that there should have been a trigger warning posted.

Also, they recommended another facebook group about ""body positive"" babywearing. Babywearing wraps come in different lengths and sizes depending on the size of the wearer and wearee and how the fabric is tied. The ""base size"" is whatever size you need to do something called a front wrap cross carry. Most people use a size 6, if you are petite you might use a 5; if you are a bit bigger you might use a 7 or 8. So in this body positive group, you are literally not allowed to state what size wrap you are using, because a focus on sizes is ""harmful."" I mean, damn, it's a length of fabric, not a moral judgement.","""Fat shaming"" in my mommy group"
fatpeoplestories,"Hello! I am sorry for the absence, I recently downloaded the Sims 4 and got caught up in nostalgia/trapping my sims in the pool/creating human representations of my 4 cats. 

Today we will revisit the time in which I was not the transporter of a Ham, but a very disgruntled partner of one. To refresh: I worked as an EMT in interfacility transfer, i.e. taking non emergency patients to the nursing home/their home from the hospital or vice versa. Many of my patients were Hams, but the main one I encountered on this 12 hour day sat in the seat next to me in the front of the rig. 

And boy, was he *awesome*. 

You all may remember Kevin, who I hated and was a garbage dump of a human being that never stopped running his mouth about himself unless he was throwing a grade 3 hissy fit. Ham Partner, actually Ham Kevin, henceforth HK, made OBVI IM A FIREFIGHTER Kevin look like an upstanding young man. *barfs*

So one summer day I miserably clock in at work and call dispatch to see what rig I’m on. I receive my info and meander over. I have an issue with being late, so I’m about 15 minutes early, and can take my sweet time moseying. I check to make sure the rig is stocked and I park my ass in the drivers seat where I begin to play solitaire, until the entire building shudders. 

I look over to where the overnight shift is clocking out and the day shift is clocking in, and I spy with my little eye a ham of epic proportions. Now in EMS, along with the police force, well in any profession really but specifically ours, there is the occasional rotund individual that makes you wonder how that’s even possible in our field. In transfer work, there’s a lot less to do than 911 services, so maintaining fitness is not a requirement like it is in fire departments etc. 

I chuckle to myself that it would suck to have him as a partner, hubris has been committed, I’m an idiot who doesn’t learn from her mistakes, LET’S MOVE ON, MOM. Low and behold, HK lumbers over to the rig I’m in, and the first words out of his mouth revolve around food and why didn’t I bring any? Because I hate you already, that’s why. I suppose that if you had a buddy who you usually worked with, maybe you’d trade off bringing breakfast. I, however, have no friends and hate everyone except gf/cats, so clearly that was not the case for me. 

Morning moves along. I find out, whether I wanted to or not, that HK is 18, which to me means he was on a mission to gain as much weight as he was currently hauling around in as short a time as possible. He yammers monotonously about things I can’t remember because obviously I cared neither then nor now. We do a few runs then get about an hour where we don’t have anything, so we go to some convenience store. I say I don’t need anything, he goes in to get his beetus whatever, and I plop down on the back of the rig to smoke (yes I know it’s bad I’m quitting). 

He slugs his way out of the store about 30 min later, and asks to bum a smoke (ha I’m so hip with my lingo). Okay, fine, have one. He proceeds to sit down next to me on my like 2 feet of bumper which is occupied by my 1.75 foot butt. I quickly find myself on the ground, the victim of a vigorous booty bounce. HP guffaws, all 12 of his chins quivering in delight. I glare at him with all the intimidation someone on the ground can muster as I unceremoniously get up and sit on the other 2 feet of bumper on the other side of the license plate. Note that at least 3/4 of HK cheek is hanging down into the section where the license plate is, but he seems unfazed. 

I prepare to tune him out when my phone rings, it’s a call from dispatch. I’m talking to them while he gropes my arm with his sausage fingers asking for another cig. I give it to him just to get his ickiness off me, and remind myself to burn the shirt I’m wearing and consult a doctor for potential arm amputation. Dispatch says that we need to go to a small local airport to be the lift assist for another company’s crew, which strikes me as odd since I have to bargain my first born child (lol never happening #Cats4Lyfe) to even get dispatch to consider sending their own crews a lift assist. 

HK loads his considerable mass into the passenger seat, the rig’s axels weep for their mother, I sit in the driver’s with the grace of a ballerina obv, and we head out. He babbles the entire way about how cool we are, how this guy must be super important, wondering what’s wrong. I couldn’t give a flying high in the sky fuck, because we are literally going to carry him some amount of feet, then deposit him in the back of another rig, and return to our own miserable existence. We arrive at the airport to a metric fuck ton of traffic, and that’s when it dawns on me that it’s THE AIR SHOW, at local airport and adjacent fairgrounds. HASHTAG FUCK YEAH. I like planes and shit and now I’m as happy as HK in a candy store. 

Except this is the moment where HK makes a noise like a dying dinosaur, snorts, and horks up a big ol loogie into one of his empty monster energy cans - at that point there were 3 littering the floor of the rig. I’m like “u good? but also idc” and he says, “oh yeah, it’s cool, I dip”. I mean okay but that’s not a noise I associate with the practice of dipping and you’re killing my vibe but whatever PLANES. 

Except, no planes. At least not for a while, it’s the first day of the air show and the air part of it won’t begin for a while. I’m bummed, but we’ve gotten to where we’re supposed to go and meet with the guy who knows when the plane is landing etc. At that point we discover it won’t be landing for 3 hours, but we got sent here anyway so just sit on down and hang out. Bro air-show-patrol-marshal-idfk-dude says that since we’re going to be waiting around, he can sneak us passes to cavort around the air show booths etc. I’m like hells ya B, which causes HK to echo me. I shake off the feeling of being covered in sewer sludge, and take off to fulfill my childhood dreams of, you guessed it, looking at PLANES N SHIT. 

Except nothing good in EMS comes without a hefty price tag. And by hefty I mean 350 pounds of young adult slush trying to follow me *everywhere*. 

“Hey OP can you slow down?!”
“No. PLANES.”
“Yeah but we’re partners we need to stick together.”

Okay rolly-polly-not-homie, we’re not partners for life, just partners for this hellacious 12 hour shift that I wish was over before it started. I wanted to see some dope planes, and lard monster decided he wanted to see the same planes. So I was trying to maneuver my way through all the booths as quickly as I could, knowing I only had 2.5 hours left to see all the stuff. 

And then. Hahahaha. THEN. The Army’s Black Knights are on the runway preparing for their routine, and I comment that my ex went to West Point. HK says “oh what’s his MOS now?” And I said “I think she’s X” (actually can’t remember now). 

Time stops. His jowls quiver. 

*“She????!”*

Yeah dude. She. I can totes understand how you didn’t know, it’s not like my stature is more like a dude than a lady, my hair cut is shorter than yours, and I’m wearing all the men’s uniform apparel. But YEAH BUDDY I’M GAY. 

HK pulls away from me like being a homosexual is catching. I own it. I’m like yeah bud you’ve never thought about dudes before? I’d consider it. Open your mind, free yourself, meditate, Buddhism, all the way. He’s now 15 feet away staring at me like I just ate a baby in front of him. I smile and continue on my rounds of the planes and their accoutrements. 

Aside - During this time I receive a text from dispatch: “is the plane landed yet?” No, and clearly the concept of speaking grammatically correct English has not landed in your brain either. 

The time has come when the plane is scheduled to land, so HK and I find the other crew and walk out to the tarmac. HK looks terrified, like I’m going to jump on him and cover him in gay spores. Whatever, I’m just glad to be away from his gravitational pull. 

The guy being flown in is also a ham, but a fun ham. He makes fun of himself and is a jolly old fellow, which makes hauling his monstrous ass out of a teeny plane slightly less horrific. It took us about an hour, somehow we succeeded and he was on his way to wherever hams with gangrene on their leg go. Probably to the amputation suite, but I digress. 

HK and I are now back in the rig. The air is so thick with his discomfort that you could slice it with a knife, and then he’d probably eat it. We get our final call for the day, and we switch seats so I can be in the back with the patient. 

As we cross paths around the front of the rig, I hiss at him. He recoils like he’s been doused with acid and lets out a shriek that would make a Disney princess envious. I chuckle and get in the truck, he follows soon after. I don’t think his eyes left the road once, or left his shoes when we had to walk somewhat next to each other. 

Afterwards, any time he saw me in the cavernous ambulance garage, he’d run away as fast as his gargantuan legs could carry him, chins aflutter. I’d make a point to give him my best creep face (akin to r/PrettyGirlsUglyFaces). 

Ahh, summer lovin, havin a blast. Only thing better than a Kevin Ham, is a Homophobic Kevin Ham.

fatpeoplestories,"Today was my high school's football signing day, aka where football players who are chosen to play ""college ball"" sign a piece of paper and put on a hat of the college they're signing to. since this took place in my school gym first thing in the morning and i happen to have pe first hour, i was allowed to sit in the bleachers and watch the quick process happen along with my other classmates (around 30 people). after this was over, our principal announced that donuts and orange juice were available to EVERYONE in the gym, as there were more than enough for everyone to have a decent serving. 

enter janitorial ham. i would estimate she's about 5'6, closer to 275, and wore a bright patterned janitor set that did not flatter her ""curves"". she stood near the table with glazed donuts and orange juice like a guard, holding her broom, seemingly deeming entry to whoever just wanted breakfast. me, two girls i'm vaguely acquainted with and a male friend of mine in the class walked to the table after the small stream of parents, football players, and cheerleaders died off and tried to get a donut. me and my aforementioned male friend (let's call him j), successfully got a donut and a small cup of orange juice. the two female acquaintances (let's call them a and r), did not. janitorial ham literally grabbed a by the shoulders (keep in mind that a is about 5 feet, and about 100lbs), and turned her around, saying ""the refreshments are only for football players and their parents."" this was laughable to me because i saw her ham son (about 5'10 and 290) grab four doughnuts, two in each hand and scuttle off to the solitude of the health room which isn't used during the second semester. 

a and r were rightfully pissed, mainly because they didn't get a donut and felt it was because the janitor was discriminating against them because they were 1. female and 2. thin. i found this to be reasonable considering i live in the deep south where sons are wayyyy valued over daughters sometimes and being ""thin"" is nearly abnormal. to add insult to injury, the group of us spent about 30 minutes watching the ham put donuts into napkins and then place them into a purse that was on the bottom bleacher and a short walk from the refreshments table. luckily, a kind football player by the name of ""skeeter"" gave a and r a few donuts from his box that was given to him. afterwards, we continued to watch janitorial ham who drank at least five cups of orange juice, but that's all i managed to count before getting bored and a diabetic high from the sugar.

tl;dr janitor ham lets me and other male friend get donuts and juice but bars female acquaintances from doing so. she claims because it's only for football players and their parents despite the fact me, j and her ham son have never touched a football. she then smuggles donuts into purse and drinks orange juice like water while a kind football player gives a and r donuts.",Janitorial Ham
fatpeoplestories,"Thank you all for the love on the last post, also got a kick out of a BeetusBot linking my stories - I haven't posted really anything so that was super fun to see.

I mentioned the ""tag along"" in the last post, but didn't elaborate. Why you ask? Well, dramatic effect of course. You know that scene from Jurassic Park, with the T-Rex stomping up and water rippling ominously? Yeah. Keep imagining that.

Enter, Nascar Ham. So named for the dirty, stained Nascar t-shit/brown velour lounge pants this creature would wear before changing into the store uniform. She had lank, greasy hair and smelled vaguely of stale cheetos and sadness. 5’2” at least 250, probably more. I’m bad at guessing weight, but suffice to say, she waddled.

Nascar Ham is a delight for FPS. Fatlogic and “cundishuns” abound. She would park herself on the step-stool behind the cash desk because of her “bad knees,” same reason why she couldn’t stock the copy machines, clean the counter, re-shelve items - she basically couldn’t do anything in the job description, but she’s Hamager’s ~~moon~~ friend so she’s allowed to just sit there like the useless blob she was.

I could wax poetic about how terrible she was at her job, but this is fatpeoplestories, not shittyemployeestories (does that exist?) so here we go.

Let’s start with the reason she’s Hamager’s best pal. These two *curvy* woman were helping each other diet. Well, they were complaining about dieting together, I never witnessed any actual dieting happening. And as mentioned, neither can exercise because of their bad knees, but they’re on their feet all day at work! (My eyes rolled so hard I gave myself a headache.)

Instead of a long(er) story of woe, I give you the fast facts of Nascar Ham:

Her and my Hamager kept the McBeetus across the parking lot in business and out of  **diet**  coke. I would bet money on it.
She lined the pockets of her apron with skittles to snack on throughout the day. And I don’t mean she had a bag in her pocket. I mean she would empty packets of skittles into her apron (easy access??) Aprons that have never seen a washing machine and that she also had sugar-crusted pens sitting in as well. (Yes Nascar Ham, I am looking for a pen, no I don’t want to borrow yours because just touching it may give me the beetus.)
Every shift she would chomp her way through a pack of mentos and a 2 liter bottle of  **diet**  coke. And that’s on top of the apron skittles, the McBeetus with a  **diet**  beetus on the side for lunch. (Did I mention it's  **diet** ? She's being so good,  **diet**  soda is so much healthier!^fuckingkillme )

All of this was done while loudly complaining that the diet she was on didn’t have enough sugahs and if she didn’t eat all this she could die/pass out/lose her mind... 

This was the first, and essentially only, person I have ever met in my life to actually use the words “condishuns” and “sugahs.” I’ve seen fatlogic before, but I honestly didn’t think real humans talked like her. My very own walking, talking FPS.

Well, hope you all enjoyed reading about the Hams I had to work with once upon a time. I'm trying to remember a specific story that would be long enough for FPS, so if my brain scrounges anything up, you'll all be the first to know.

Happy reading!
